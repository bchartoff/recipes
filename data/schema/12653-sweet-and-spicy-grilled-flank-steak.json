{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet and Spicy Grilled Flank Steak", "description": "There are some steaks that need nothing more than a little salt and pepper to bring out their beefy goodness. Flank steak is not one of them. This bold marinade is just the sort of seasoning the brawny cut begs for: lime juice and zest add brightness, brown sugar sweetness, and jalape\u00f1o and sriracha a complex heat. Just whiz it all together in a food processor and slather it on the meat. Marinate overnight (or 20 minutes if that's all the time you have) before tossing it on the grill. Lastly, always make more flank steak that you think you want. Leftovers are the best part.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/01/dining/01APPE_SPAN/01APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, steaks and chops", "keywords": "beef, flank steak, dairy-free, gluten-free, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 454}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 239, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "314 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons coarsely chopped scallions", "1 tablespoon peeled and finely chopped ginger", "1 fresh jalape\u00f1o, seeded if desired, coarsely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "Zest of 1/2 lime", "2 teaspoons lime juice", "1 teaspoon sriracha or other hot sauce (or to taste)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "1 1/2 pounds flank steak"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, pulse together scallion, ginger, jalape\u00f1o, garlic, sugar, lime zest and juice, and sriracha.
