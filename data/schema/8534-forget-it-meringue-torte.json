Place it in your oven, turn it off, and head to bed. (Make sure not to peek!) In the morning, you\u2019ll have a pavlova. Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey brought this clever recipe, Molly Chappellet, an owner of Chappellet Vineyards, to The Times in 1978, and Amanda Hesser rehashed it in 2006. It\u2019s a perfect casual dessert for a dinner party, especially if the day before looks busy. Serve it with the raspberry sauce, as suggested, to cut through any sweetness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/29/dining/Forget-It-Meringue-Torte/Forget-It-Meringue-Torte-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 12", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "dessert, egg whites, raspberries, sugar, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 56}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 313, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "59 milligrams", "sugarContent": "54 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter", "1 1/2 cups egg whites (9 to 11 eggs)", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "3 cups plus 1 tablespoon sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "1 cup heavy cream", "3 -10-ounce packages frozen raspberries, defrosted, or fresh raspberries", "2 tablespoons kirsch or framboise liqueur"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
