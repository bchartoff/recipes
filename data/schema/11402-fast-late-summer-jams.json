But they don't have to, because they'll be gone long before they begin to spoil. Here are a few fast ways to hold on to the flavors of summer. The fig jam is good spread on toast, but also when served as a kind of chutney beside grilled meats. The peach or nectarine variation will add an ambrosial depth to your toast. And the blueberry jam? Its canvas is ice cream, or hot pancakes. In any case, use your spices sparingly, and let the fruit shine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/12/dining/figs-still/figs-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups of jam", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, condiments, dips and spreads", "keywords": "blueberries, figs, nectarine, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 31}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 302, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "77 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "70 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound figs, stemmed and chopped", "1 vanilla bean", "1/4 cup sugar, or to taste", "1 pound blueberries, picked over", "1 3-inch cinnamon stick", "1/2 cup sugar, or to taste", "1 1/2 pounds peaches or nectarines, peeled, pitted and chopped", "1 tablespoon peeled and minced ginger", "1/3 cup honey, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine ingredients for any of the jams in a small-to-medium saucepan; fruit should be at a depth of a couple of inches.
