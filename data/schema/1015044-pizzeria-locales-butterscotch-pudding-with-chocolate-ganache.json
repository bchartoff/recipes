{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pizzeria Locale's Butterscotch Pudding With Chocolate Ganache", "description": "While most butterscotch pudding recipes rely simply on dark brown sugar for their flavor, Pizzeria Locale in Denver adds an intense, nutty character by caramelizing the brown sugar first. Beyond a little salt, there is no other flavor added to distract from the caramel \u2013 no vanilla, no alcohol, no spice. They are not missed.\n\nIf you\u2019re pressed for time, you could skip the ganache topping, substituting grated milk chocolate bits on top or leaving the chocolate off altogether. Even the whipped cream is optional. Butterscotch pudding this good stands on its own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/02/dining/02Takeaway/02Takeaway-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dark brown sugar, heavy cream, milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 174}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 563, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "sodiumContent": "300 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups heavy cream", "1 1/2 cups milk", "150 grams dark brown sugar (3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon)", "5 grams fine sea salt (3/4 teaspoon)", "4 large egg yolks", "1 large egg", "12 grams cornstarch (1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon)", "4 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup heavy cream", "70 grams chopped milk chocolate (2 1/2 ounces)", "Whipped cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pudding: In a small pot, bring 3 cups cream and milk to a simmer.
