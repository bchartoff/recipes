Bring to a boil and then simmer for two hours. Strain the broth into another large pot. Save the meat, but discard the rest of the solids. If the stock in your new pot is greasy, let it cool for about 15 minutes and then place 6 ice cubes in the pot. The grease will immediately congeal and you can spoon out the ice cubes and grease in one fell swoop. Your homemade beef stock is ready."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Now it is time to make the soup. First, taste the stock and add salt and pepper to taste.
