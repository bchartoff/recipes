{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Striped Bass With Potatoes and Olives", "description": "From the chef Jonathan Waxman comes this simple, casually elegant dish, ideal for guests but not too fancy for family dinners. Bass fillet (one large piece, or two smaller fillets) is baked atop a bed of thinly sliced Yukon Golds, allowing the juices to soak into the potatoes, permeating them with flavor. A mandoline is useful for slicing the potatoes (watch those fingers!), or the slicing disc on your food processor. If you don't have either of those, a sharp knife will do nicely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-STRIPEDBASS/19COOKING-STRIPEDBASS-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "bass, potato, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 91}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 565, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "46 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1230 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "2 pounds large Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/8-inch thick", "Sea salt", "ground black pepper", "2 pounds wild striped bass fillet, with skin (1 to 2 fillets)", "1 cup pitted picholine olives", "8 bay leaves", "2 lemons, in thin wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
