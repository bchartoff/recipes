The dough is baked twice: first in a log, and then again after it's been sliced into cookies. This recipe includes the smart trick of freezing the dough after baking it the first time, then cutting it into slices when still frozen before baking again. This makes for a thinner slice, fewer crumbs when cutting and a crispier texture. You can make it with matzo cake meal during Passover \u2014 a delicious variation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05PASSOVER3/05PASSOVER3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 30 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european, jewish", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "almond, almond flour, matzo cake meal, orange, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 75}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 193, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "40 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups plus 1 tablespoon/264 grams all-purpose flour or 1 1/2 cups/204 grams matzo cake meal", "1/2 cup/85 grams potato starch", "1/2 cup/55 grams almond flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon sea salt", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "12 tablespoons/169 grams/1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter or coconut oil, at room temperature", "3 large eggs", "1 cup/126 grams slivered almonds", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla", "Zest of 2 oranges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, mix flour or matzo cake meal, potato starch, almond flour, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and the salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream 1 cup/200 grams sugar and the butter or coconut oil.
