{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carolina Chicken Bog", "description": "Here is a rich and peppery stew that hails from the coastal plains of the Carolinas. The name derives from the way in which the pieces of chicken sit in the pot, like hummocks in a bog. It has since spread across both North and South Carolina, according to Kathleen Purvis, the food editor of The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina. \u201cBog is one of those classic Carolina meals,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clumpy, it\u2019s delicious and you see it everywhere \u2014 at football games and Nascar race weeks alike.\u201d Recipes for bog are as varied as the 146 counties of North and South Carolina. For ours, we turned to Robert Stehling, who runs the Hominy Grill in Charleston, S.C. Mr. Stehling\u2019s bog features just about every part of the bird you can name, save feet and cockscombs. (Which would be worthy additions.) As outlined in the recipe here, the dish serves about eight hungry people, but the proportions can be adapted by anyone who can do a little fourth-grade math.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman And Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/dining/ss-carolina-chicken-bog/ss-carolina-chicken-bog-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "At least 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, sausage, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 36}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 696, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1381 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons bacon fat, or neutral oil like corn or canola", "3/4 pound minced chicken gizzards and hearts", "Salt and pepper", "2 medium green bell peppers, diced", "2 medium red bell peppers, diced", "4 medium-to-large white onions, diced", "4 celery ribs, trimmed and diced", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 cup dry red wine", "1 35-ounce can tomatoes, with liquid, chopped", "6 tablespoons butter", "4 tablespoons flour", "1 pound mixed sausages and cured meat, like kielbasa, Italian sausage, breakfast links, chorizo, diced ham or bacon", "2 cups chicken stock", "1 branch thyme", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste", "2 bay leaves", "1 pound chopped chicken meat, preferably from thigh", "8 chicken livers, trimmed and cut in half", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar", "1/2 cup Dijon mustard", "Cooked white rice for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put fat or oil in a deep skillet or large casserole over medium-high heat.
