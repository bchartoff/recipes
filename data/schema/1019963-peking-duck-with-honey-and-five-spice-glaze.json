{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peking Duck With Honey and Five-Spice Glaze", "description": "Peking duck is one of the most famous and popular Chinese dishes. The traditional method is grand and laborious, requiring three days of intense preparation. This recipe simplifies that method for a home version that comes pretty close to the original. For that coveted crisp, golden skin, all the excess fat is trimmed, and the skin is separated from the meat. The duck is then air-dried overnight and roasted vertically to ensure even cooking, while rendering out the fat. The crunchiest skin comes from the duck\u2019s backside and legs, so carve them off first to maintain their crackly texture. A simple honey and five-spice glaze creates a beautiful mahogany lacquer on the finished duck.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/28/dining/kc-peking-duck/kc-peking-duck-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "duck, hoisin sauce, honey, sesame oil, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 143}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons mild honey, such as clover, acacia or orange blossom", "2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "1 teaspoon turbinado or light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon five-spice powder", "1 (5- to 6-pound) Peking or Long Island duck", "3 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 (24-ounce) beer can or other aluminum can, emptied and filled halfway with water", "1/2 cup hoisin sauce", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "8\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018334-chinese-wheat-wrappers\">homemade Chinese tortillas</a>, or 8-inch store-bought flour tortillas, warmed", "4 scallions, cut into 3-inch pieces and thinly sliced lengthwise", "2 Kirby or Persian cucumbers, cut into 3-inch-long matchsticks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine honey, soy sauce, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder in a small saucepan.
