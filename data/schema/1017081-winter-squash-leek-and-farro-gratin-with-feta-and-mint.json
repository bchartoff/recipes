This tastes like the filling of many Greek winter squash pies I have made, but it is a simpler dish. The squash is roasted, which gives it great depth of flavor. I love the sweetness of the squash against the salty feta, and the chewy farro against the tender squash. Most of the elements for this gratin can be prepared ahead if you want to go about this piecemeal \u2013 farro freezes well and keeps for a few days in the refrigerator; roasted squash keeps well in the refrigerator for a few days as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/25/science/26recipehealth/26recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 188}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 325, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "688 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds winter squash, peeled and cut in small dice (about 1/2 inch)", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 pound leeks (2 large), white and light green parts only, cleaned and chopped", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "3 to 4 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, or 1 to 2 tablespoons dried mint (to taste)", "3 eggs", "3 ounces feta, crumbled", "3/4 cup cooked faro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
