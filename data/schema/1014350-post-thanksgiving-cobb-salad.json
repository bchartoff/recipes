{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Post-Thanksgiving Cobb Salad", "description": "The classic California Cobb salad is a composed salad made with chicken breast, lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, chopped hard-boiled eggs, bacon, and blue cheese. It should never be a jumble: the elements are arranged on a platter or in a wide bowl side by side, then dressed, and it\u2019s up to the diner to mix them together. This version dispenses with the bacon and reduces the amount of Roquefort or blue cheese called for in the traditional Cobb. Tomatoes are not in season so I have eliminated them, too, and replaced them with grated carrots. Chopped toasted almonds, which can be salted if you can handle it, can stand in for the bacon. <br/><br/>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/27/science/26recipehealth/26recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 as a main dish", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "avocado, roquefort cheese, shredded turkey, fall, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, raw", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 410, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "614 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small or medium garlic clove", "Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup canola or grapeseed oil", "2 cups shredded cooked turkey, chicken breast or chicken breast tenders (12 ounces cooked)", "2 romaine hearts, or 1 romaine heart and 1 head bibb lettuce, cut crosswise in chiffonade", "1 small head radicchio, cut in chiffonade (optional)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or 1 tablespoon each parsley and tarragon", "3 hard-boiled eggs, chopped", "1 large ripe but firm avocado, sliced or diced", "1 large or 2 medium carrots, peeled and grated", "2 ounces (about 1/2 cup) Roquefort or blue cheese, crumbled", "1/4 cup chopped toasted almonds (salted or barbecued if desired)", "2 tablespoons chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing.
