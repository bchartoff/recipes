It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</em>\nGrab a super-tanned rotisserie chicken on the way home. Tear the meat into strips, then cut a few smallish supermarket tomatoes (or better, if you\u2019ve got them) into wedges and marinate them in oil, salt, pepper and red wine vinegar. Pay a few bills or fold some laundry, then turn the whole thing into panzanella by mixing together the chicken, the tomatoes, some fresh watercress and some chunks of stale or toasted bread, then showering the salad with freshly ground black pepper and a spray of kosher salt. This, too, is cooking.\n<em>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</em>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17NORECIPE-PANZANELLA-CHICKEN/merlin_147763899_7052bf35-0ab6-44e9-aad1-58e9f463fa15-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry, salads and dressings", "keywords": "main course, rotisserie chicken, stale bread, tomato, watercress", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 162}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
