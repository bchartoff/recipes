Cover again, return to the oven and bake until the custard is just set (if you shake the jar or tap on the side, the custard should still jiggle slightly), another 5 to 10 minutes. Carefully (with tongs or a kitchen towel) remove the jars from the water bath, and let them cool a bit (you want to serve them warm). Garnish each custard with some of the kaffir lime and a few slices of pepper, and serve."}]}
