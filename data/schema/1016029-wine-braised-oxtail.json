{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wine-Braised Oxtail", "description": "Don\u2019t be scared off by oxtail just because you may never have cooked it before. It\u2019s as meaty and rich as short ribs, and just as straightforward to prepare. In this hearty braise, the meat is simmered in wine with carrots and celeriac. Feel free to substitute other vegetables for those roots. For example: mushrooms, celery stalks, turnips, rutabaga, winter squash chunks, and sweet potatoes would all be happy additions to the pot. Or leave the vegetables out and serve the whole thing over mashed potatoes, egg noodles or polenta. Like all braises, it can be made at least four days ahead, and gets better as it sits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/06/multimedia/clark-oxtail/clark-oxtail-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "celeriac, oxtail, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 349}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1210, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "75 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "76 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "sodiumContent": "1276 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt, more as needed\n", "2 teaspoons black pepper\n", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice\n", "5 pounds beef oxtails, patted dry\n", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n", "4 shallots, peeled, trimmed and sliced lengthwise 1/4-inch-thick \n", "4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 3-inch lengths\n", "2 small or 1 large celeriac, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks\n", "1 tablespoon tomato paste\n", "6 large garlic cloves, finely chopped\n", "1 bottle (750 milliliters) dry red wine\n", "1 cup chicken stock\n", "5 parsley sprigs, plus 1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves \n", "2 rosemary branches\n", "2 bay leaves\n", "Grated zest of 1 lemon\n", "Torn celery leaves, for garnish (optional) \n"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine salt, pepper and allspice.
