If you\u2019d like, you can cut potatoes into round slices, medium-size chunks or wedges for frying, or use whole baby potatoes, peeled. Any kind of vegetable oil will work for frying; add a chunk of fatty bacon or some lard to oil in the pot for extra savoriness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/13/multimedia/French-Fries_SOCIAL_still/French-Fries_SOCIAL_still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 293}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1165, "unsaturatedFatContent": "75 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "97 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "84 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1320 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large Idaho potatoes", "Vegetable oil, for frying", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel potatoes and cut them lengthwise into slices, 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick, keeping the slices together.
