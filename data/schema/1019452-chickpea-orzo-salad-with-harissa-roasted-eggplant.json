{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chickpea Orzo Salad With Harissa-Roasted Eggplant", "description": "Where a typical potluck pasta salad is creamy and mayonnaise-rich, this one is vegetable-forward, crunchy and spicy. The heat comes from harissa, a North African paste typically made with red and hot peppers, and spices like coriander, caraway and cumin, which is used to marinate the vegetables and to dress the salad. Offset some of the intensity with mild mozzarella cheese, deeply toasted walnuts and salty bright-green olives, and no one will miss your great aunt\u2019s bowties.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jampel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/dining/chickpea-orzo/chickpea-orzo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday", "keywords": "eggplant, green olives, harissa, orzo, main course, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 118}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 498, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "666 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for the pasta", "2 tablespoons harissa, plus more for seasoning", "1 large Italian eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces", "Kosher salt", "Black pepper", "8 ounces orzo (or other small pasta)", "1 cup walnuts", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1/2 cup pitted green olives (preferably bright green Castelvetranos), roughly chopped or torn", "1/4 cup fresh thyme or fresh oregano, roughly chopped, or a mix of the two", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "Baby kale or mixed greens, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the eggplant: Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
