Like many peasant dishes, Mr. Williams said, stew chicken was often made with leftover scraps like chicken backs, and you could do the same, though the recipe here has been adapted for bone-in chicken thighs or the more economical chicken leg quarters. At the Food Sermon, his restaurant in Brooklyn, he\u2019ll serve it with rice and beans, but his preferred method is his own twist with chickpeas, sweet potato and the Caribbean version of paratha roti, an Indian flatbread he updates with fennel seed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/28/dining/28JPCARIBBEAN8/28JPCARIBBEAN8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken thighs, culantro, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 154}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 694, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "789 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 pounds bone-in chicken thighs or chicken leg quarters", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon ground clove", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 tablespoon ketchup", "4 garlic cloves, crushed", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice", "1 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped (about 1 tablespoon, or use 2 teaspoons powdered ginger)", "1 medium onion, quartered", "4 scallions, white and green parts, roughly chopped", "1 bay leaf", "5 pieces of culantro (a Caribbean herb also known as chadon beni) or whole sprigs of cilantro, chopped", "5 sprigs fresh thyme (or use 3 teaspoons dried leaves)", "4 tablespoons white vinegar", "1/2 Scotch bonnet pepper (or use habanero)", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "4 tablespoons sugar", "2 tablespoons flour, more as needed, for dusting chicken"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove skin and trim fat from chicken.
