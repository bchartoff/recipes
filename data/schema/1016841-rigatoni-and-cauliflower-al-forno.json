{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rigatoni and Cauliflower al Forno", "description": "Cauliflower is perhaps the least appreciated member of the large family of cruciferous vegetables, no doubt due to memories of encountering it boiled, flabby and timidly seasoned, if seasoned at all. When cooked properly, it is a delight. Cauliflower can stand up to rather bold seasoning, in fact. In this recipe, it gets garlic, sage, red pepper and capers. And it is browned in olive oil, which further enhances the flavor. If you want a terrific side vegetable, just serve the saut\u00e9ed cauliflower and skip the rigatoni. But combining the cauliflower with large-format pasta, pecorino cheese and bread crumbs, then baking it until crisply golden, makes for a splendid meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/01/dining/01KITCHEN3/01KITCHEN3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas", "keywords": "cauliflower, fontina, mozzarella, rigatoni, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2416}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 521, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "70 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "575 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound rigatoni or other large pasta shape", "1 medium cauliflower, about 1 1/2 pounds", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and pepper", "1 tablespoon capers, roughly chopped", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped sage, plus a few sage leaves left whole", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "6 ounces coarsely grated fontina or mozzarella", "2 ounces finely grated Romano cheese or other hard pecorino", "1/2 cup coarse dry bread crumbs", "2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the rigatoni in well-salted water according to package directions, but drain while still quite al dente.
