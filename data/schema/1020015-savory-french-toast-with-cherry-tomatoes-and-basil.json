It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</em>\n\nYou know a stash\u00a0of leftover bread makes the best French toast for breakfast, so it stands to reason that a savory version would be equally satisfying for the crew around your dinner table. At least that\u2019s true in my house.\u00a0Whisk the eggs as you usually would, but omit the sugar and cinnamon, hitting it instead with black pepper, chopped basil and a dash of hot sauce. Slide some slices of old bread in there to soak, then fry the toasts up in butter just as you would at breakfast. Scattering a few handfuls of halved cherry tomatoes into the pan as the bread cooks will yield a fine topping. Those who have doubted will doubt no more.\n\n<em>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</em>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17norecipe-savoryfrenchtoast/17norecipe-savoryfrenchtoast-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, weekday, breads, vegetables", "keywords": "bread, cherry tomatoes, eggs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 123}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
