There, the chef Glenn Harris offers a matzo brei that is an expanded version of his mother's. Mr. Harris's mother, in Brooklyn, made sweet matzo brei with honey or jelly, or matzo meal pancakes the size of silver dollars sprinkled with sugar. His version is much more elaborate, with cubes of caramelized apples, a vanilla-honey sauce and mascarpone.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "quick, snack, pies and tarts", "keywords": "apple, honey, mascarpone, matzo, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 750, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "100 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "481 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup honey", "1 vanilla bean", "9 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1 1-pound box matzo", "8 large eggs", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 ounces mascarpone cheese (or yogurt)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place honey in a small saucepan or microwavable bowl.
