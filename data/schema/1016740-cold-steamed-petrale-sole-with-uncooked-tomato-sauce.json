Prepare the fillets by slapping them \u2013 not too hard \u2013 with the flat side of a knife, just to break down fibers so they don\u2019t curl too much when you steam them.

If the fish fillets are too long to lie on the rack, fold them over at the middle. \nCombine about 1 inch of water and a couple of basil sprigs in the bottom of your steamer and bring to a boil. Place steaming rack in pot and steam fish for 5 minutes, until opaque and fish pulls apart when you insert a fork into it. Remove from heat, transfer to a lightly oiled platter and allow to cool.
