Their solution? Cooking a big cut of meat. For their first attempt, they looked to lamb, specifically this Moroccan lamb, coated with harissa, lemon zest and juice (which they used as a substitute for preserved lemons), and cured before roasting. The end result, served with a mint dressing, and perhaps a side of couscous or even mashed potatoes, is a satisfying show-stopper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Matt Lee And Ted Lee"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/16/dining/Moroccan-Leg-of-Lamb-With-Mint-Dressing/Moroccan-Leg-of-Lamb-With-Mint-Dressing-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "lamb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 184}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 810, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "58 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "66 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "391 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 9-to-11-pound bone-in leg of lamb, trimmed of fat and membrane", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/3 cup fruity-tasting olive oil", "1/3 cup lemon juice", "1 tablespoon lemon zest", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 tablespoon harissa (Moroccan chili paste), more for serving", "1 teaspoon whole coriander seeds, toasted and crushed", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12099-mint-dressing\">Mint dressing </a>"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Score meaty side of lamb in a diamond pattern of 1/4-inch-deep cuts about 1 1/2 inches apart.
