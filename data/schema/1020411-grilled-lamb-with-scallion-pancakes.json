{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Lamb With Scallion Pancakes", "description": "Here is a recipe for grilled lamb inspired by Northern China. It\u2019s treated to a five-spice and soy sauce rub, and served, in a nod to Peking duck, with cucumbers, hoisin sauce and pancakes. The pancakes are not the typically thin crepes served for wrapping slices of Peking duck. Instead they are classic scallion pancakes, a dim sum item usually eaten alone. Here they\u2019re spread with hoisin sauce and topped with slices of lamb and cucumber. Alternatively, you could serve the pancakes like tortillas, to wrap around the lamb, taco-style. Either way, it\u2019s party food.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/28/dining/22pairrex/merlin_159456246_3ff0716e-adba-489f-aa15-a85d786eed4b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 leg of lamb, rump end, boned and butterflied (about 3\u00a01/2 pounds)", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon five-spice powder", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "2 cups chopped scallions", "Vegetable oil, preferably grapeseed, for frying", "2 cucumbers, peeled, seeded and julienned", "1/2 cup hoisin sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate the meat: Brush the lamb with soy sauce and coat with five-spice powder.
