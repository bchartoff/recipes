I\u2019m hungry at the end of the day, and dinner is the one meal of the day that I sit down to enjoy in a leisurely fashion, whether alone or in company. I\u2019ve found that one of the most enjoyable ways to bulk up my salads (as well as panini and grain-and-vegetable combos) is to top the dish with a poached egg. Sometimes poached eggs are the centerpiece of my dinner, cooked in marinara or spicy tomato sauce and served with toasted country bread or over rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/25/science/24recipehealth/24recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "eggs, quinoa, spinach, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 80}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 397, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "15 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "937 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 allspice berry", "1 clove", "8 coriander seeds", "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Half of a 12-ounce bunch of fresh spinach, stemmed and washed thoroughly, or 1 bag baby spinach, rinsed", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil", "3/4 cup cooked quinoa", "1 or 2 eggs to taste, poached (see above)", "1/4 ounce (1 tablespoon) crumbled feta, or 1 to 2 tablespoons drained yogurt, seasoned, if desired, with pur\u00e9ed garlic"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grind the allspice berry, clove and coriander seeds in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle.
