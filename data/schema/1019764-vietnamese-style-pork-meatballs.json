{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vietnamese-Style Pork Meatballs", "description": "These nuoc cham-inspired meatballs are perfect to fill lettuce cups topped with fresh basil or cilantro. (Add steamed rice for a more substantial meal.) The Ritz crackers here make for a juicier meatball, but feel free to substitute plain dry bread crumbs. To make the Ritz crumbs, place the crackers in a resealable plastic bag and lightly crush them with the back of a wooden spoon or measuring cup. For an easy dipping sauce, spike 1/4 cup mayonnaise with 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil or soy sauce. And save any leftover meatballs: They're great simmered in chicken broth the next day. The ginger and garlic in them release their aromatics into the broth for a deeply flavorful soup base.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/16/dining/kc-vietnamese-pork-meatballs/kc-vietnamese-pork-meatballs-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, meatballs", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, fish sauce, ginger, ground pork, ritz crackers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 896}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 356, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "505 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons peeled and minced ginger", "1 tablespoon minced garlic (from about 3 large cloves)", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup finely crushed Ritz crackers (12 crackers)", "1 pound ground pork"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
