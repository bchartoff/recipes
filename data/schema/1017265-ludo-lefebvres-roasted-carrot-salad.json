But it works just as well spread across a platter as a light dinner or lunch, and pairs well with a fresh baguette and a glass of chilled red wine. Toasting the cumin for the carrots and the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is very important, but don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t find all the herbs for the garnish. Just one or two will bring pleasure.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/08/magazine/08eat1/08mag-08eat.t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 544}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "11/2 pounds small carrots, approximately5 inches in length, scrubbed clean andtops trimmed", "1 bay leaf (fresh, scored)", "1 head garlic, cut in half", "5 to 7 sprigs fresh thyme", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground blackpepper to taste", "2 blood oranges, juiced", "1 tablespoon white vinegar", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "Pinch kosher salt", "1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped roastedalmonds", "2 blood oranges, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/dining/100000003068678/cooking-techniques-segmenting-citrus.html?playlistId=100000003066037\">cut into supremes</a>", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley", "1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon", "1 tablespoon finely chopped chervil", "1 tablespoon finely chopped chives", "Kosher salt or fleur de sel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400.
