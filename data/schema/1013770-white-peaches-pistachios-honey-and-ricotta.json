It\u2019s inspired by a Catalan honey-and-cheese dessert called mel i mat\u00f3, with an unexpected sprinkle of pistachios and fresh peaches. \n\nAfter falling ill, Mr. Mullen changed his diet to focus more on ingredients with anti-inflammatory effects. Many such foods, like stone fruits, often play a central role in the Spanish cuisine he specializes in.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/White-Peaches-Pistachios/White-Peaches-Pistachios-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "dessert, honey, peach, ricotta, raw, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 406, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "97 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 or 3 firm white peaches", "Juice of 1 lemon", "1 pound fresh ricotta", "4 tablespoons honey", "1/4 cup shelled pistachios, toasted in a dry, hot pan for 30 seconds", "2 tablespoons fruity extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Quarter and pit the peaches, and slice them into thin curls on a mandoline.
