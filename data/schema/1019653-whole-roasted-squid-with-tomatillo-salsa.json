You can roast the whole squid on a sheet pan in a hot oven, on the stovetop in a cast-iron pan or on a grill over coals. They cook quickly, and are done as soon as the tubes puff up and the tentacles are firm, which takes mere minutes. If you want them browned, leave them longer on the heat source, but they taste perfectly good if cooked pale.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/17/dining/17Kitchen4/merlin_144678486_279a584b-c9b1-4cb3-98d8-ee9589c54555-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, seafood", "keywords": "avocado, boiling potatoes, poblano chile, squid, tomatillo, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 21}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 501, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1252 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound tomatillos, husks removed, halved or quartered (about 3 cups)", "1 jalape\u00f1o, halved lengthwise, then cut in large chunks", "2 cups roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, packed", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "1 1/2 pounds very small boiling potatoes", "Salt and pepper", "4 large poblano chiles", "2 pounds cleaned small squid", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as necessary", "3 medium avocados, cut into thick slices or chunks", "1 medium red onion, thinly sliced", "1/2 pound cherry tomatoes, halved", "Cilantro sprigs, for garnish (optional)", "Thinly sliced jalape\u00f1o, for garnish (optional)", "Lime wedges, for serving", "Warm corn tortillas, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the salsa: Put the tomatillos, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, salt and lime juice in a food processor or blender.
