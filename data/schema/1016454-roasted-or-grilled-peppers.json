You can grill them under a broiler, over a burner flame, or over coals, or you can roast them in the oven. Oven-roasting is the easiest method if you\u2019re roasting more than one or two peppers. It yields more juice than grilling.  Keep these on hand, serve them as they are or add to salads, pasta, pizza and panini.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/11/science/recipehealthpepper/recipehealthpepper-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 45}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 113, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "455 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium red, green, or yellow bell peppers", "Sea salt (fine or coarse) or kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 or 2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed", "Slivered fresh basil leaves or chopped fresh tarragon, chervil or marjoram", "1 teaspoon balsamic or sherry vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Roasting in the oven", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 425\u00baF.
