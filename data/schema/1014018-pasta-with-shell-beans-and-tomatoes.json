{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Shell Beans and Tomatoes", "description": "Many cooks find working with fresh shell beans, so smooth and cool in your hands, to be unexpectedly satisfying. The pods may be tough, but the beans inside are tender and ready to cook, and they need not be skinned after removal from the pods. Once shelled, fresh beans require just 40 to 45 minutes of simmering. And in terms of nutrition, they have everything dried beans have to offer: lots of protein and fiber, calcium, iron, folic acid and potassium.At my local farmers\u2019 market, I\u2019ve found large scarlet runner beans (they really are more purple than red, and some farmers call them purple runners); mottled pink-and-white cranberry beans (also known as borlotti, they come in the most beautiful pink pods); creamy, pale yellow cannelinis; and similar bean with pink markings called yellow Indian woman beans. Many are heirloom varieties and each is a little different, but they all have creamy textures and a wonderful fresh flavor. This is a very comforting pasta. I like to use large shells or tubes, which catch the beans and sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/09/21/health/21recipehealth_600/21recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "healthy, vegetarian, main course, pasta, shell beans, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 468, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "82 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1885 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 to 1 1/4 pounds shell beans (about 1 3/4 to 2 cups)", "1 small onion, halved", "7 cups water", "4 large garlic cloves, 2 crushed, 2 minced", "A bouquet garni made with a few sprigs each of parsley and thyme, a sprig of sage, a Parmesan rind and a bay leaf", "Salt to taste", "2 pounds tomatoes", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Pinch of sugar", "1 large basil sprig, plus a handful of fresh basil leaves, slivered", "3/4 pound pasta, preferably large shells or tubes, or bow ties", "Freshly grated Parmesan for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the beans, onion, water, the crushed garlic cloves, bouquet garni and salt to taste in a heavy saucepan or soup pot, and bring to a simmer.
