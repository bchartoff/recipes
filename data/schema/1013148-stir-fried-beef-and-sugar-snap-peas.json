{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Beef and Sugar Snap Peas", "description": "Here's a stir-fry far better than most take-out Chinese, and you can make it with any lean cut of meat \u2014 flank steak, London broil, tenderloin, sirloin or skirt steak \u2014 so long as it is cut thin against the grain. Most takeout joints use snow peas, but sugar snaps are juicier and more succulent, and just as crunchy. (Their downside is that they are slightly more work: they need to be thinly sliced.) As for the sauce, it's simple: thick dark soy sauce (tamari works well), sesame oil, chicken broth and Madeira.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/dining/mc-stir-fried-beef-sugar-snap-pea/merlin_148333179_bcb802d6-1d0c-40c6-bf7d-b911a9b23a42-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, weeknight, one pot", "keywords": "beef, sugar snap peas, gluten-free, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 782}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 329, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "816 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound lean beef, cut into 1/4-inch strips", "3 tablespoons tamari or dark soy sauce", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, more for drizzling", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed", "3 fat scallions", "2/3 cup chicken broth", "2 1/2 tablespoons Madeira or sweet sherry", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "3 tablespoons peanut or olive oil", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "Rice, for serving", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds (optional)", "Sriracha or other hot sauce, or rice wine vinegar for garnish", "chili oil, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, mix beef, 2 tablespoons tamari, sesame oil, salt and pepper.
