{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Clams and Spaghetti With Spicy Tomato Broth", "description": "Many Italian recipes call for simmering fish and shellfish in \u201cacqua pazza,\u201d or crazy water. It's a quick way to make a small amount of tasty broth, and obviously more flavorful than cooking fish in plain water would be. Every cook makes it differently, but most recipes involve olive oil, tomato and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Garlic, parsley, capers, lemon and even smashed anchovy could also be part of the mixture. The end result is the perfect year-round medium for cooking fish fillets or shrimp or to serve as the base for a brothy bowlful of clams and spaghetti. It takes only a few minutes, and the cooking liquid, conveniently, is also the sauce. Basil leaves and fresh cherry tomatoes, halved and drizzled with olive oil and salt, give the dish a summery feel.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/23/dining/23kitchen1/merlin_137723106_2db7ed24-22b7-4018-a86d-c10f51910322-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas, seafood", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, clams, dry white wine, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 163}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 31, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "88 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small onion, diced", "1/2 cup chopped green garlic shoots or 2 teaspoons minced garlic", "1 bay leaf", "2 or 3 medium hot fresh red peppers, such as Dutch or Fresno, cut into 1/4-inch slices, or 1/2 teaspoon dried red-pepper flakes", "1 large thyme sprig", "Salt and pepper", "2 cups crushed tomatoes (canned is fine)", "1 cup dry white wine", "4 or 5 pounds small clams, such as manila or cherrystones", "1 pound spaghetti", "2 cups red and yellow cherry tomatoes, halved", "1 tablespoon thinly sliced chives", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley", "Handful of basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a large pot of water on a back burner over medium-high heat, covered, so it is ready and boiling when it\u2019s time to cook the pasta."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a wide Dutch oven or deep heavy-bottomed skillet with a lid over medium-high heat.
