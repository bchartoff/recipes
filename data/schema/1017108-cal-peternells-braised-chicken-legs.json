{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cal Peternell\u2019s Braised Chicken Legs", "description": "Here is a pleasant, delicious family meal adapted from the California chef Cal Peternell\u2019s excellent home-cooking manifesto, \u201cTwelve Recipes,\u201d published in 2014 by HarperCollins. There are two steps to the process, which as Mr. Peternell points out can lead to endless improvisation. First, season the chicken and brown it well in a pan. Salt, pepper and flour are what\u2019s called for in this basic recipe, but adding some paprika would be a delicious option, or some cumin, coriander, paprika and a dash of cinnamon and caraway for a scent of Morocco. Then, braise it in liquid \u2014 white wine for the classic, red wine for a coq-au-vin feel, or with beer, chicken stock or plain water. Mr. Peternell does his braising in the oven, but you could easily do it on the stovetop as well, simmering the chicken slowly beneath a lid. Pair with rice or boiled potatoes, with couscous, with big hunks of garlic bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/07/dining/07COOKBOOKTWELVERECIPES2/07COOKBOOKTWELVERECIPES2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "chicken legs, wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1257}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 577, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "49 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1078 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 chicken legs, thigh and drumstick together", "Kosher salt and black pepper to taste", "All-purpose flour, for dredging", "4 to 5 tablespoons neutral oil, or unsalted butter", "3/4 cup white or red wine, beer, chicken stock or water", "1 large yellow onion, peeled and diced", "1 large carrot, peeled and diced", "2 celery stalks, diced", "2 cloves garlic, peeled and diced", "3 sprigs of thyme, rosemary or sage, leaves removed and roughly chopped", "1 bay leaf", "3 cups chicken stock, or water", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken legs with salt and pepper and let them sit for a while, 15 minutes to an hour, or overnight in the refrigerator."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
