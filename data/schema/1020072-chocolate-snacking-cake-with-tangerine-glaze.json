{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Snacking Cake With Tangerine Glaze", "description": "This moist, darkly bittersweet snacking cake is easily mixed with a whisk. Using a neutral oil rather than butter allows the chocolate flavor to shine, and gives the crumb an especially velvety texture under a sweet-tart glaze. You can use any kind of orange for the topping. Tangerines and mandarins (including clementines) are bright and spicy, but regular navel or juice oranges work just as well. Or if you can find blood oranges, the glaze will take on a pinkish hue and a sweeter, richer flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/13/dining/08Apperex-chocolate1/merlin_150934335_09143881-cbb1-4f05-9a24-6e69b7f013e6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "dessert, hot coffee, sour cream, tangerine juice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 235}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 234, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "129 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/80 milliliters neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola, plus more for pan", "3/4 cup/95 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/50 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 ounces/60 grams chopped dark chocolate (about 1/3 cup)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters hot coffee", "3/4 cup/155 grams light brown sugar", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters sour cream", "2 large eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 tablespoon finely grated tangerine zest", "1 tablespoon tangerine juice", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1 cup/115 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
