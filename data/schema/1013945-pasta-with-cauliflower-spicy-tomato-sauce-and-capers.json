{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Cauliflower, Spicy Tomato Sauce and Capers", "description": "This dish is made with perciatelli, hollow long noodles that also go by the name bucatini. Their texture is robust, supporting a robust sauce like this one. Because the noodles are hollow, they cook much more quickly than spaghetti, so keep your eye on them so they don\u2019t get too soft. If you can't find perciatelli, spaghetti makes a fine substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/23/science/25recipehealth/25recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "bucatini, canned tomatoes, cauliflower, fall, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 310}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 477, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "72 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "659 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small cauliflower or 1/2 large cauliflower, broken into florets about 1 pound", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes", "1 14-ounce can chopped tomatoes with juice, pulsed a few times in a food processor or mini processor", "Pinch of sugar", "2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and chopped", "3/4 pound perciatelli (bucatini)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "2 ounces pecorino, grated (1/2 cup), or 1 ounce each pecorino and Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil while you core the cauliflower and break it into florets.
