My mother would make soup just this way; she served it in the pumpkin, too. We kids looked forward to it every year. Along the way I\u2019ve improved it a little bit. I added the croutons, which I saut\u00e9 in butter and salt. She didn\u2019t do that. I love soup, and this soup in particular. We usually have Thanksgiving up in the Catskills, at our friends\u2019 house. I always say I\u2019m not cooking, and I end up cooking. This is what I make.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Soltner"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/25/dining/video-soltnerstillNEW/video-soltnerstillNEW-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings (about 2 quarts)", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "main course, side dish, pumpkin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 62}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 335, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1096 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pumpkin, 8 to 10 inches in diameter", "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter", "1 medium onion, sliced", "2/3 cup dry white wine", "2 small white turnips, peeled and sliced", "1 large carrot, peeled and sliced", "1 large potato, peeled and sliced", "5 cups chicken stock (or water), or as needed", "1 10-inch French-style baguette or 2 small rolls, crusts removed, thinly sliced", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "Salt and ground white pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut off top of pumpkin at least 5 inches across, so that it can serve as a lid.
