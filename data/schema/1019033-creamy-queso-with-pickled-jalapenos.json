But it can't be just any cheese. This is one of those rare instances (see also: cheeseburger) where the preferred cheese is good, old-fashioned, highly processed American cheese. Velveeta is tops, but Land O'Lakes and Boar\u2019s Head have deli versions that will do. Kraft singles work, too, but it's a lot of unwrapping. The pickled jalape\u00f1os in this recipe aren\u2019t traditional, but they do add some welcome heat and a bit of tang that cut through the richness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/dining/16COOKING-QUEST-JALAPENO/16COOKING-QUEST-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 432}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 671, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "sodiumContent": "1227 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 jalape\u00f1os, with seeds, finely chopped", "1/2 cup white distilled vinegar", "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 3/4 cups whole milk, plus more as needed", "1 pound Monterey Jack or white Cheddar, grated", "1 pound\u00a0white or yellow American cheese, shredded or diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/2 cup sour cream \u00a0", "4 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced", "3/4 cup cilantro, tender leaves and stems, chopped", "Tortilla chips, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place half of the jalape\u00f1os in a small bowl and cover with vinegar.
