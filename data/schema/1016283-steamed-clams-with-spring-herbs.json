{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Steamed Clams With Spring Herbs", "description": "A pot full of garlicky steamed clams needs nothing more than some crusty bread \u2013 or even just a spoon \u2013 to accompany it. In this version, tarragon and chives add a bracing freshness to the clams while lime juice and zest brighten things up. Take your time when cleaning the clams; they need a good scrubbing under running water to remove all the sand and grit. If you do find grit in the sauce after cooking, either strain it through a sieve lined with a dish towel, or let it settle to the bottom of the pot and spoon the sauce off the top. This recipe also works with mussels if you add 1/4 cup water to the pot along with the shellfish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/24/multimedia/clark-steamed-clams/clark-steamed-clams-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "clams, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 259}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 373, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1312 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon", "2 1/2 pounds littleneck clams (about 30 clams), scrubbed", "1/4 cup minced chives", "Grated zest of 1 lime", "Pinch red pepper flakes", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot or large straight-sided skillet with a lid, warm oil over medium heat.
