One reason is that oysters seem to have built-in festivity \u2014 even when they were abundant to the point of local glut, they were eaten happily in bars that served only them, festively. The part of this recipe that requires any skill or focus is the shucking. This is a good skill to have anyway, and can't be gotten other than by practicing, meaning an hors d'oeuvre that is both nice for your guests and an exercise in self-edification. Once they\u2019ve been opened, the oysters need little other attention.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/21/magazine/21eat/21eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, oyster, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 57}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "437 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup whole peeled tomatoes, juices drained and saved for soup", "Rock salt", "12 small to medium oysters, like Island Creeks or Montauk Pearls", "1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, warmed to room temperature", "2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot or red onion"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler to high.
