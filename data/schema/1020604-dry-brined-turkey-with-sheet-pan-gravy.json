{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dry-Brined Turkey With Sheet-Pan Gravy", "description": "For those who want to let the side dishes do the talking, this is the bird for you. Delightfully simple, it\u2019s dry-brined (meaning highly seasoned) with only salt, pepper, some thyme and a little brown sugar, which helps with that golden-brown skin. It\u2019s roasted on a sheet pan, and cut-up onions, garlic, lemon and herbs are scattered in and around the turkey to cook at the same time. They\u2019re excellent served alongside the turkey, and are instrumental in flavoring the sheet-pan gravy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/13/dining/11Romanrex5/merlin_161937558_cd8d44c8-5662-4f6e-a33c-8135670a2336-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "apple cider vinegar, lemon, onion, soy sauce, turkey, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 555}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch fresh thyme", "1 (12- to 14-pound) turkey", "1/3 cup kosher salt", "1/3 cup light brown sugar", "2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper", "4 to 5 medium red onions, quartered\u00a0", "3 lemons, halved crosswise\u00a0", "2 heads garlic, halved crosswise\u00a0", "1/3 cup olive oil\u00a0", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter\u00a0", "3 cups Cheater\u2019s Turkey Stock (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020608-cheaters-turkey-stock\">see recipe</a>), or low-sodium chicken, turkey or vegetable broth, plus more as needed", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter\u00a0", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour\u00a0", "2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, plus more to taste\u00a0", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar, plus more to taste\u00a0", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the turkey: Strip the leaves from 4 sprigs of thyme, and coarsely chop the leaves.
