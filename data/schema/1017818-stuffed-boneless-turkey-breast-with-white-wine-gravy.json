{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffed Boneless Turkey Breast With White Wine Gravy", "description": "Here (at last) is a recipe for roasted turkey breast with the visual impact of a whole bird, complete with mahogany skin and drippings for gravy. The technique of sandwiching a layer of bread stuffing between two boneless turkey breasts is adapted from a recipe by Julia Child. It can be served instead of \u2014 or alongside, if you have a large group \u2014 a traditional Thanksgiving turkey.  \nDon\u2019t fuss overmuch about the assembly.  Even if the stuffing seems to be escaping, or if the shape is more like a football than a turkey, once the roast is wrapped and baked, it will contract into a neat bundle.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/18/dining/18JULIAREX1/18JULIAREX1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "roasts", "keywords": "fall, winter, main course, turkey, white wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 95}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 453, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "654 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole bone-in turkey breast, 10 to 14 pounds", "Salt and ground black pepper", "4 to 8 ounces unsalted butter", "1 recipe any bread stuffing, (like <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/417-porcini-bread-stuffing\">Porcini Bread Stuffing</a> or see <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/how-to-make-stuffing\">Melissa Clark\u2019s Stuffing Guide</a>)", "1 onion, roughly chopped", "1 carrot, roughly chopped", "Turkey stock", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 cup white wine or vermouth, or additional stock"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bone the turkey breast: Pull off the skin in one piece, using your fingers to separate the skin from the meat.
