{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Indian Butter Tofu (Tofu Makhani)", "description": "This recipe is a vegetarian riff on <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016754-butter-chicken\">butter chicken</a>, or murgh makhani, a classic Indian dish in which chicken simmers in a rich, dairy-laden tomato sauce that\u2019s seasoned with heady spices like turmeric, cumin, garam masala and cardamom. This weeknight-friendly version has a toned-down ingredient list, and the tofu doesn\u2019t require hours of marinating, which means you can get everything on the table in under an hour if you start the rice as the tomatoes are cooking down. Heavy cream gives this dish a rich finish, but full-fat coconut milk makes a fine substitute. Whatever you do, don\u2019t substitute anything for the butter or ghee (sorry, vegans) \u2014 it\u2019s the signature ingredient.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/11/dining/sc-butter-tofu/merlin_151400949_506842b1-ded5-442e-88b5-4f1e13be071e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, curries", "keywords": "cumin, ginger, heavy cream, tofu, turmeric, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1314}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 592, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "783 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 heaping tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 (14-ounce) packages firm tofu", "8 tablespoons ghee or unsalted butter (1 stick)", "2 yellow onions, peeled and diced", "1 teaspoon ground chile powder, such as cayenne", "3 tablespoons peeled and minced fresh ginger", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 teaspoon paprika", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 1/2 cups heavy cream or full-fat coconut milk", "3 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias", "1/4 cup cilantro leaves and tender stems", "Naan, basmati rice, yogurt and quartered cucumbers, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk the lemon juice, cumin and 1 heaping tablespoon turmeric with 1 tablespoon water to make a thin paste.
