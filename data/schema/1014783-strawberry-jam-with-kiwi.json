{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Jam With Kiwi", "description": "Strawberry turns out to be one of the more difficult jams to make. It\u2019s often runny. But if you just add a kiwi, packed with natural pectin, it will make any jam gel. Kiwi\u2019s flavor is subtle, slightly tart and not at all intrusive. I add mint to the mix to bump up the candy-sweet flavor of the berries. Your jam will hold together beautifully, tasting of strawberries and sunshine and nothing more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Cathy Barrow"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/05/dining/05STRAWBERRY_SPAN/05STRAWBERRY-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "5 half-pint (8-ounce) jars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, project", "keywords": "kiwi, strawberry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 24}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 568, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "144 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "5 milligrams", "sugarContent": "135 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds ripe fresh strawberries", "1 kiwi", "3 cups sugar", "Juice of one lemon", "4 sprigs of mint, preferably peppermint", "1 vanilla bean, optional", "1/2 teaspoon unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash, dry, hull and stem berries, then dice into 1/2-inch pieces, about 8 cups."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel and dice the kiwi into 1/2-inch pieces."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir together the berries, kiwi, sugar and lemon juice in a large bowl.
