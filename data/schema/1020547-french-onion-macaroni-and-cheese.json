{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "French Onion Macaroni and Cheese", "description": "This outrageously good macaroni and cheese fuses two classic comfort foods into one dish. Caramelizing onions can be a time-consuming affair, but here, the process is sped up by using high heat and and a little water to prevent scorching. The sauce is made with a combination of Gruy\u00e8re, to remind you of French onion soup, and white Cheddar, to make it melty and smooth. Instead of topping the dish with a dusting of diminutive bread crumbs, it\u2019s dotted with Gruy\u00e8re toasts that become melty and crisp after a few minutes under the broiler. (You\u2019ll want to slide a sheet pan underneath before baking, in case some of the sauce bubbles over.) This is over-the-top richness at its best.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/dining/as-french-onion-mac-and-cheese/merlin_162800874_a013024f-1d26-4eaa-8157-a25db2e0db74-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, pastas", "keywords": "gruy\u00e8re, onion, pasta, white cheddar, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1007}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 pounds yellow or Vidalia onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced", "5 sprigs fresh thyme, plus more thyme leaves for garnish", "1 fresh or dried bay leaf (optional)", "Black pepper", "1 pound cavatappi or elbow pasta", "1 baguette, cut into 1/2-inch slices", "1 garlic clove", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, red wine vinegar or white wine vinegar", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "4 cups whole milk", "16 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, grated (about 5 cups)", "12 ounces white Cheddar, grated (about 4 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
