It is \u201ca superb version, a highly seasoned, creamy concoction with chunks of tomatoes\u201d that is served over a pile of grits enriched with plenty of butter, salt and Cheddar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Reed"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/30/dining/30COOKING-SHRIMPGRITS2/30COOKING-SHRIMPGRITS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun, creole, southern", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "cheddar, grits, shrimp, main course, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 667}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 685, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "sodiumContent": "890 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup grits", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "6 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated", "3 tablespoons butter", "4 tablespoons butter", "3/4 cup chopped onion", "1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper", "2 gloves garlic, minced", "1 cup diced ripe tomatoes with a little of their juice (chopped canned tomatoes are preferable to less-than-perfect fresh tomatoes)", "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 tablespoon flour", "1 pound medium to large raw shrimp, shelled (reserve shells for stock)", "1/2 to 1 cup shrimp stock (see note)", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1/3 cup heavy cream", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "2 dashes Tabasco", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the grits, bring 3 1/2 cups water to a boil and stir in the grits.
