{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pernil", "description": "This classic Puerto Rican recipe for roast pork makes a festive centerpiece for a Memorial Day feast, a delicious welcome to summer. If you buy a big pork shoulder and take your time, as you should, the classic Puerto Rican pork roast called pernil can take you nearly all day. Yet there are times I feel almost guilty about this dish because the process is beyond easy and incredibly impressive, it feeds as many people as a medium-size ham, and the flavor is unbelievable. When I first learned how to make a classic pernil, about 30 years ago, the only seasonings I used were oregano, garlic and vinegar. But I\u2019ve taken some liberties by adding a little cumin and some chiles. The onion is my addition, too. After all, pork is less flavorful than it used to be.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/02/dining/bittman-pernil/merlin_162118548_d1d912f3-4814-44f8-9520-776e92c55ccf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "At least 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "main course, oregano, pork", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 685}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 816, "unsaturatedFatContent": "36 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "63 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "1060 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pork shoulder, 4 to 7 pounds (or use fresh ham)", "4 or more cloves garlic, peeled", "1 large onion, quartered", "2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves or 1 tablespoon dried oregano", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ancho or other mild chili powder", "1 tablespoon salt", "2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "Olive oil as needed", "1 tablespoon wine or cider vinegar", "Lime wedges for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees.
