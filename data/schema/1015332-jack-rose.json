{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jack Rose", "description": "The Jack Rose is the classic cocktail that never got invited to the oldies reunion. While other sours, such as the daiquiri, the Daisy, the Sidecar and select others, are revered and reinterpreted in their dotage, this mainstay of the 1920s and \u201930s has fallen so far out of circulation that few still know its name. More\u2019s the pity, for when properly made it is one of the canon\u2019s stronger pillars, and a perfect sip when the post-equinox winds set in. The drink is simply a sour made from apple brandy \u2014 or applejack, as it was known from Colonial times through Prohibition \u2014 with grenadine syrup as the sweetener. Its name is attributed to any number of colorful characters, including a famous gangster stool pigeon, but it most likely comes from the shortening of applejack and the dusty rose color the drink attains from the grenadine and citrus.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Toby Cecchini"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "Serves 1.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy, cocktails", "keywords": "apple brandy, grenadine syrup, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 80, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces Laird 100-proof Straight Apple Brandy, or 2 ounces Clear Creek Eau de Vie de Pomme", "1 ounce fresh lime juice", "1/2 to 1 ounce grenadine syrup (see <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1015334/grenadine-syrup.html'>recipe</a>), adjust according to taste."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Shake over ice and strain into a stemmed cocktail glass.
