It\u2019s easy to make it home, because the recipe doesn\u2019t require homemade ice cream (although it wouldn\u2019t hurt.) And most of the pieces can be made ahead of time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/maple-leaf-rag-sundae/maple-leaf-rag-sundae-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "recipeYield": "4 large sundaes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "banana ice cream, maple syrup, pineapple, dessert, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup unsalted walnut halves, toasted", "1 cup maple syrup, preferably dark amber or grade B, plus more as needed", "2 cups very ripe pineapple chunks", "Lemon juice, if needed", "Granulated sugar, if needed", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "2 teaspoons confectioner\u2019s sugar", "1/2 gallon banana ice cream, preferably homemade; or use chocolate or coffee flavor"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the walnuts and maple syrup in a container, adding more syrup if needed to cover the nuts.

Decorate the top with whipped cream, in a maple leaf pattern if you are using a dispenser."}]}
