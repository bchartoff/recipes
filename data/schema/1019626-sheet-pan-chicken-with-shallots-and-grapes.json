{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Shallots and Grapes", "description": "This one-pan meal is simple enough for a weeknight, but impressive enough to serve at a dinner party. Chicken thighs are quickly marinated in garlic, olive oil and za\u2019atar, if you\u2019d like, while the oven comes to temperature. Then, they\u2019re roasted alongside thick wedges of shallots and sweet grapes, whose flavors are gently coaxed together and deepened by the chicken fat as they cook. Serve straight from the sheet pan, or plate on a pretty platter. Serve with a salad of chicories dressed with lemon, olive oil, anchovies and salty pecorino cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/28/dining/ch-roasted-chicken-grapes/ch-roasted-chicken-grapes-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, grapes, shallot, thyme, za\u2019atar, fall, summer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1599}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 609, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "783 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 to 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, patted dry", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon za\u2019atar (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 medium to large shallots, peeled and quartered root to stem", "8 ounces seedless red or green grapes, or a combination, broken into small clusters on the vine", "4 to 5 thyme\u00a0sprigs, plus 2 teaspoons finely chopped thyme", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
