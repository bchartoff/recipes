The result is a plate of thick, luscious pork with a deep, burnished crust, redolent of garlic and rosemary, and a sunset of soft, smoky peaches nutty with brown butter. The technique is what Francis Mallmann, the Latin American chef who developed the recipe and is its most refined and stylish practitioner, calls \u201cthe uncertain edge of burnt.\u201d It requires patience and keen observation. What you are looking for on the edges of the meat and fruit is color: a deep, dark brown that is almost black \u2014 a black without bitter, a burn that is not burned.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/06/dining/06COOKING-GRILLEDPORKNPEACHES2/06COOKING-GRILLEDPORKNPEACHES2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "garlic, peach, pork, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 680}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 822, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "58 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1179 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Boneless pork butt, approximately 2 pounds, butterflied and trimmed", "8 to 10 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary needles", "8 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "6 fresh peaches, skin on, cut in half and pitted", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into dice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Light a fire in a fire pit with a grill, or in a charcoal grill, or set a gas grill to high.
