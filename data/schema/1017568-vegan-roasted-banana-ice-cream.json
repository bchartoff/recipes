{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Roasted Banana Ice Cream", "description": "A combination of coconut milk, homemade cashew milk and cocoa butter gives this dairy-free ice cream its particularly luscious, creamy texture. Ripe bananas, roasted with brown sugar and coconut oil until caramelized and golden, add a deep butterscotch-like note. You\u2019ll need to start this at least one day before you plan to serve it. Or make it up to a week ahead. Chopped bittersweet chocolate makes a fine substitute for the walnuts, or use 1/3 cup of each.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/22/dining/22COOKBOOK1/22COOKBOOK1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "banana, cashew, cocoa butter, coconut milk, coconut oil, dairy-free, gluten-free, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 147}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 334, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "135 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/200 grams raw, unsalted cashews", "4 medium bananas, preferably somewhat speckled but not brown, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "6 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons/90 grams extra-virgin coconut oil", "2 tablespoons/28 grams dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon/5 grams plus a pinch kosher salt", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/80 grams cocoa butter, available at baking supply stores and online", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/266 milliliters coconut milk", "1/2 cup/65 grams chopped walnuts, toasted (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the cashew milk, place the cashews in a large bowl and add water to cover by a couple of inches.
