{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Roast With Roasted Jalape\u00f1o Gravy", "description": "Eddie Hernandez, who runs Taqueria del Sol, a string of easygoing Mexican restaurants in Georgia and Tennessee, considers himself a born-again Southern boy whose food reflects a mash-up of the two cultures. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Monterrey, Mexico, where a pork roast like this would have never made it onto the table. But he came to love the roast\u2019s role in a traditional Southern Sunday supper, and decided to give it his own Mexican twist. It has become one of the most popular specials at his restaurants. The granulated garlic and onion are essential to the flavor. The roast cooks fast in a hot oven that crisps the fat. The residual oven heat roasts the jalape\u00f1os while the meat rests. Once you make the roux, the rich gravy for the dish comes together quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/11/dining/11turniprex1/11turniprex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "main course, pork loin, jalape\u00f1os", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 79}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 376, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "612 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon salt", "1 tablespoon ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon granulated garlic", "1 tablespoon granulated onion", "2 1/2 to 3 pounds boneless pork loin, with a good layer of fat on it", "3 tablespoons butter", "4 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour", "2 jalape\u00f1os", "1 teaspoon vegetable oil", "1 cup half-and-half", "2 cups pork stock or chicken stock, preferably homemade", "1 teaspoon salt, plus more if needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 475 degrees.
