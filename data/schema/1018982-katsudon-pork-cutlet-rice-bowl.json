{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Katsudon (Pork-Cutlet Rice Bowl)", "description": "Katsudon is a comforting, belly-warming dish from Japan, composed of sliced pork cutlets simmered in a dashi-based broth with onion and eggs and served over a bowl of warm rice. It's an ideal way to use up leftover cutlets from the refrigerator, but it's even more rewarding when it's made with fresh, warm cutlets, and it comes together quickly enough for a weeknight. Variations of katsudon can be found on restaurant menus and home kitchens \u2014 and in anime. This recipe includes an optional addition of frozen peas, inspired by the main character in \"Yuri!!! on Ice,\" whose parents serve katsudon with peas at their fictional inn. But it takes some delicious real-life cues from the work of Nancy Singleton Hachisu (who adds a small amount of julienned ginger to her broth, brightening it) and from the chef Tadashi Ono.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/22/magazine/22eat/22eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, steaks and chops", "keywords": "bonito flakes, kombu, panko, pork, pork cutlets", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 263}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 787, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "47 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "2261 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups water", "1 piece kombu, about 5 inches by 6 inches", "1 ounce bonito flakes", "2 pork-loin cutlets, 1/2 inch thick", "1/2 cup flour", "1 egg, lightly beaten", "3/4 cup panko", "Salt and pepper", "Vegetable oil, for deep-frying", "2/3 cup dashi", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons mirin", "1/2 cup white onion, thinly sliced", "1 piece ginger, 1 inch thick, thinly sliced and cut into strips", "1/4 cup frozen peas (optional)", "4 eggs", "White rice, to serve", "2 scallions, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the dashi, bring the water and kombu up to a simmer, then turn off the heat.
