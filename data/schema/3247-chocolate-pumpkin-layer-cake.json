{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate-Pumpkin Layer Cake", "description": "This rich and decadent spiced pumpkin cake is just the thing to serve for an autumn celebration, Thanksgiving or otherwise. Chocolate chips and chopped pecans are added to the pumpkin batter for extra sweetness and a bit of welcome crunch. For those who like to plan ahead, it can be made and frozen \u2013 iced and all. Just put the entire finished cake on a plate or a baking sheet, unwrapped, and freeze it overnight until it is hard. Then it can be wrapped without damage to the frosting, and returned to the freezer. Layers can also be wrapped well and stored, to be iced later.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/23/dining/23PUMPKINCAKE/23PUMPKINCAKE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "chocolate, pecans, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, dessert, fall, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 986}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 765, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "94 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "46 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "290 milligrams", "sugarContent": "86 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["20 tablespoons (2 1/2 sticks) soft unsalted butter, more for greasing", "2 cups flour, more for dusting", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon allspice", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar", "3 eggs", "1 1/2 cup plain pumpkin pur\u00e9e, canned, frozen or fresh", "1 cup semisweet chocolate chips", "1 cup chopped pecans", "2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar", "10 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled to room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Milk or cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
