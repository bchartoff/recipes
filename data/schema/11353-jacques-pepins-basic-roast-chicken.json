Roast chicken is still roast chicken whether you label it haute cuisine, bourgeois cuisine or country cooking; even calling it \u201cpoulet roti\u201d will not transmogrify this simple bird. Move, however, from the kitchen to the dining room and from everyday dishes to fine china, then add an appetizer and dessert, and a family meal becomes a festive dinner for guests.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacques Pepin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/20/dining/20COOKING-BASIC-CHICKEN-STOCK2/20COOKING-BASIC-CHICKEN-STOCK2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, times classics", "keywords": "chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 730}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 583, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "50 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "926 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3 1/2-pound chicken", "Salt and ground pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
