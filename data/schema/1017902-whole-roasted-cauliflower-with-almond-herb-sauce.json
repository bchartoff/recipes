{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Roasted Cauliflower With Almond-Herb Sauce", "description": "This striking dish has become a modern classic, as chefs around the world are working out new ways to push vegetables into the center of the plate. It makes a lovely vegetarian main course after a pasta intro, or a gorgeous side dish for lamb or fish. Omit the anchovies in the sauce, and it becomes entirely vegetarian; replace the butter with more olive oil, and it turns vegan. Try using pale orange, green or purple cauliflower, or a head of spiky, psychedelic Romanesco. Carve it at the table, just like a roast, for maximum impact.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/24/dining/whole-roasted-cauliflower/whole-roasted-cauliflower-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "2 main course servings, or 4 to 6 side dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "almond, anchovy, cauliflower, parsley, gluten-free, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1297}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 900, "unsaturatedFatContent": "66 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "87 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1240 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large cauliflower", "Olive oil", "Salt", "1/3 cup blanched almonds", "6 to 10 anchovy fillets (optional)", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for basting", "2 teaspoons wine vinegar (white or red), more to taste", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped parsley, mint, tarragon, cilantro or a combination", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)", "Salt and ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven while you prepare the cauliflower: Place a heavy oven-proof skillet (a cast-iron skillet looks very nice) or a baking sheet in the oven and turn the heat to 375 degrees.
