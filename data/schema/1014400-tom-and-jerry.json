It is a rich holiday elixir, a relative of eggnog that flourished in America in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and is frequently (though not definitively) credited to Pierce Egan, the English chronicler of sports and popular culture. Robert Simonson brought this version of the drink, which is especially popular in Wisconsin and is bordering states, to The Times in 2012. It is adapted from Audrey Saunders, the owner of the Manhattan cocktail bar Pegu Club. She decreased the sugar and added Angostura bitters and vanilla. \u201cIt makes a huge difference,\u201d she said. It\u2019s best on snowy days, when it can warm and comfort from within.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/tom-and-jerry/tom-and-jerry-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink, with batter for about 10 drinks", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cognac, milk, rum, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 48}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 eggs (yolks and whites separated)", "1 pound sugar", "1 ounce a\u00f1ejo rum", "3 tablespoons vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "2 dashes Angostura bitters", "6 ounces milk", "1 ounce a\u00f1ejo rum", "1 ounce V.S.
