{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple and Miso Sheet-Pan Salmon With Green Beans", "description": "For a weeknight salmon that\u2019s impressive enough for entertaining, look no further. Salty miso paste and sweet maple syrup are the backbone of this simple, flavor-packed marinade, which is about as involved as this uncomplicated recipe gets. Here, the fish soaks up the sauce as the oven gets hot, and the snappy green beans roast in the same amount of time as the fillets. Start some rice when you walk in the door and you\u2019ll have dinner on the table in under a half hour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/20/dining/CH-salmon-and-green-beans/CH-salmon-and-green-beans-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, weeknight, seafood", "keywords": "green beans, miso, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1605}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 480, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "721 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, about 1-inch thick", "Kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "4 teaspoons maple syrup", "1 tablespoon white or brown miso", "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 garlic clove, grated", "1 pound green beans, trimmed", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil (optional)", "1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro, both leaves and tender stems", "4 lime wedges, for serving", "Flaky sea salt, for serving (optional)", "Cooked white rice, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.
