{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Seared Veal Steaks With Green Peppercorns", "description": "Green peppercorns grow on the same vine as the black peppercorns you use in your pepper mill. The difference is the green ones are picked young, while the black have been allowed to mature and dry. Though they are occasionally available still fresh on the branch, flown in directly from Southeast Asia, green peppercorns are always available preserved in brine or freeze-dried. This classic French recipe employs them in a deliciously pungent sauce for veal steaks, though boneless pork loin chops or chicken breasts can stand in nicely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/05/dining/05KITCH_SPAN/05KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings ", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops", "keywords": "main course, veal", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 426, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "728 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless veal steaks, about 6 ounces each, cut 1/2-inch thick\n", "Salt \n", "Zest of 1 lemon, in large curls\n", "4 garlic cloves, thickly sliced \n", "A few thyme sprigs\n", "All-purpose flour\n", "3 tablespoons olive oil (or shallot oil from crispy shallots; see recipe)\n", "2 tablespoons butter\n", "1 large shallot, finely diced\n", "2 to 3 tablespoons green peppercorns, rinsed if in brine or rehydrated if freeze-dried\n", "1 cup rich veal or chicken stock\n", "4 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\n", "1 tablespoon brandy\n", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley\n", "Crispy shallots for garnish, see recipe (optional)\n"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put veal steaks on a platter and season on both sides with salt.
