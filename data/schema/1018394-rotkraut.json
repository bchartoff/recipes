The dish, a nod to her grandparents\u2019 German heritage, makes regular appearances on her family\u2019s Thanksgiving table, but can be served year round. It\u2019s best prepared a day or two ahead, and also freezes well \u2014 a real boon if you\u2019re planning a big meal. Just reheat it in a covered saucepan on the stove the day you plan to serve it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/dining/COOKING-ROTKRAUT2/COOKING-GERMAN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "german", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "apple, cayenne pepper, cloves, red cabbage, red wine, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 103}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 179, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "326 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head red cabbage (about 2 pounds), halved, cored and thinly sliced", "1 cup burgundy \u00a0(or other dry red wine)", "1/2 cup light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon salt", "Dash of cayenne pepper", "Dash of ground cloves", "2 bay leaves", "2 tart apples (such as Granny Smith or Cortland), peeled, cored and thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1/2 cup apple cider vinegar", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine cabbage, wine, brown sugar, salt, cayenne, cloves, bay leaves and apples in a large pot and bring to a simmer.
