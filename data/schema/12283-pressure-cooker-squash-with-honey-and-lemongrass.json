Normally, a pressure cooker wouldn\u2019t get hot enough to caramelize anything. But, Mr. Myhrvold explained, if you create an alkaline environment with a sprinkle of baking soda, you can caramelize at a lower temperature. And the pressurized environment helps ingredients caramelize through and through, not just around the outside. This gives the squash an intense, nutty flavor, which is enhanced here with buckwheat honey and lemongrass.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/18/dining/video-myhrvoldsquash/video-myhrvoldsquash-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "gluten-free, vegetarian, side dish, squash", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 80}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 1/2 pounds delicata squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (4 cups)", "1/2 lemongrass stalk", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "Buckwheat honey or other honey"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in a pressure cooker.
