{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Chicken Tagine With Butternut Squash", "description": "Inspired by Moroccan tagines, which often pair sweet dried fruit with savory elements, this dish has deep layers of contrasting flavors: warmth and sweetness against acidity and spice. Taking the time to brown chicken skin, saut\u00e9 onion and toast spices is definitely worth the 20-minute investment here, lending this stew a rich flavor. But if you're really pressed for time, you can skip it. Instead, layer the squash, dates, onion and chicken in the slow cooker, and season everything generously with salt and pepper. Whisk together the oil, ginger, garlic, spices and lemon juice, and pour it on top before cooking. Then finish the dish the same way the recipe directs: Season to taste with lemon and salt and finish with the parsley and scallions.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/dining/sd-tagine/sd-tagine-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, tagine", "keywords": "butternut squash, chicken thigh, dates, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 698}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 644, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "876 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium-small (2 to 2 1/2 pound) butternut squash, peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded and cut into 3-inch-by-1-inch wedges", "8 pitted dates, such as Medjool, halved", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 (1-inch) cinnamon stick", "2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "1 1/2 teaspoons turmeric", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon hot smoked paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "3 1/2 to 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 8 thighs)", "1 large red onion, finely chopped", "1/4 cup minced ginger (from about a 4-inch piece peeled ginger)", "6 large garlic cloves, chopped", "1/4 cup lemon juice (from about 1 large lemon), plus more to taste", "Leaves of 1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped", "4 scallions, thinly sliced", "Cooked couscous or pita for serving (optional)", "Plain yogurt, for topping (optional)", "Toasted almonds, for topping (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the squash and dates into a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker.
