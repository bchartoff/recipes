{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fruit Cobbler With Any Fruit", "description": "You can use any fruit (or combination) to make this biscuit-topped cobbler. Just be sure to adjust the amount of sugar depending on whether your fruit is more sweet or tart. For example, blueberries, peaches, sweet cherries and pears tend to need less sugar than more acidic raspberries, sour cherries, plums and cranberries. Start with a few tablespoons and go up from there, tasting as you go. For the most tender biscuits, be sure to let the dough chill before baking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/11/dining/1S4A5150/1S4A5150-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "blackberries, blueberries, buttermilk, minute tapioca, peaches, dessert, fall, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 259}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 379, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "57 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "264 milligrams", "sugarContent": "30 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/220 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon/12 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams cold unsalted butter, cubed", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters buttermilk", "1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon/75 milliliters heavy cream", "10 cups mixed fruit, such as peaches, blueberries or blackberries", "3 tablespoons to 2/3 cup/38 to 133 grams granulated sugar, to taste", "3 tablespoons/36 grams minute tapioca", "1 tablespoon/15 grams turbinado or raw sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a piece of parchment paper on a small rimmed baking sheet or large plate."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, pulse together flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
