{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Crisp", "description": "I don't know why anyone would make a pie instead of a crisp. A crisp, most often made with apples but accommodating of almost any fruit, is better textured, better flavored and easier to make. If you choose to use pears instead of apples, be aware that unripe pears are unlikely to become tender in the time it takes the topping to brown. You must begin with pears that have started to soften, or their texture will remain unpleasantly firm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/19/dining/18COOKING-APPLECRISP2/18COOKING-APPLECRISP2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, editors' pick", "keywords": "apple, oats, dessert, fall, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1250}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 235, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups peeled, cored, sliced apples or ripe pears, 2 to 3 pounds", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, or more to taste", "1/2 cup sugar, plus 2 tablespoons", "5 tablespoons butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "3/4 cup oats", "1/2 cup walnuts or pecans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
