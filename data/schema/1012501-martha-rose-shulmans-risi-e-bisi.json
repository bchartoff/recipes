Add the onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook gently until tender and translucent, about five minutes. Add the rice and garlic, and stir until the grains of rice are separate and beginning to crackle. Add the wine, and stir until it has been absorbed. Begin adding the simmering stock two ladlefuls (about 1/2 cup) at a time. The stock should just cover the rice and should be bubbling, not too slowly nor too quickly. Cook, stirring often, until the liquid is about absorbed. Add another ladleful or two of the stock, and continue to cook in this fashion, adding more stock when the rice is almost dry and stirring, for 10 minutes. Add the peas, and continue adding stock and stirring for another 15 minutes. The peas should be tender, and the rice tender all the way through but still chewy. Taste now and correct seasoning."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add another ladleful or two of stock to the rice.
