{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Cauliflower", "description": "This dish is derived from a Marcella Hazan recipe. It\u2019s dead simple, and the cauliflower can be precooked a day ahead or so. Or, the whole thing can be made at once: cook the cauliflower in water, scoop it out and then, later, cook the pasta in the same water. It\u2019s already boiling, and you want the taste of the cauliflower anyway, so why not? The cauliflower gets cooked more, in a skillet with toasted garlic, so don\u2019t boil it to death, although you do want it to be tender. And in the original Minimalist recipe, from 2000, bread crumbs were added to the skillet along with the cauliflower, but since some pasta water is usually added to the skillet to keep the mixture saucy, the bread crumbs become soggy. Better, then, to stir the bread crumbs in at the very end. They should be very coarse and ideally homemade, and if they\u2019re toasted in olive oil in a separate skillet before you toss them in, so much the better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/califlowervid/califlowervid-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "3 or 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 578}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 686, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "112 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "678 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head cauliflower, about 1 pound", "Salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 pound penne, fusilli or other cut pasta", "1 cup coarse bread crumbs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
