{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Easy Rhubarb Trifle", "description": "Boozy, soggy, creamy, sweet and tart, this simple cake is somewhat like a tiramis\u00f9, since it is layered with ladyfingers. (But let\u2019s not call it a tiramis\u00f9, because it\u2019s really not authentic or traditional.) It\u2019s more like a simplified trifle, as it has no custard sauce or whipped cream, but it\u2019s rich and delicious nonetheless. Mascarpone and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche are whisked together for the creamy filling, and Campari, orange liqueur and brandy punch up the cooked rhubarb\u2019s syrup. Look for store-bought ladyfingers, available in Italian shops and many supermarkets, or substitute good-quality poundcake or sponge cake. The trifle can be assembled up to a day in advance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/24/dining/24kitchrex1/24kitchrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, ladyfingers, mascarpone, rhubarb, dessert, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 114}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds rhubarb, tough peels removed, cut into 3/8-inch pieces", "1 cup/200 grams plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons Cointreau or triple sec", "1 tablespoon Campari", "1 tablespoon brandy or Cognac", "1 cup/250 grams (8 ounces) mascarpone\u00a0", "1 cup/250 grams (8 ounces) cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 teaspoon grated orange zest", "About 20 store-bought ladyfingers,\u00a0or use poundcake or sponge cake", "Fresh\u00a0rose petals,\u00a0organic or unsprayed,\u00a0for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
