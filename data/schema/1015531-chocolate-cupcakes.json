{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Cupcakes", "description": "Right or wrong I\u2019ve always viewed the cupcake as a frosting transport system, and if you\u2019re not a huge frosting fan (I\u2019m not), then I figured, why bother? Then I remembered a friend had mentioned a recipe from Maida Heatter that was, in her words, a \u201cgrown-up cupcake.\u201d I figured perhaps I owed the miniature confections a chance. Ms. Heatter\u2019s recipe, modestly entitled, \u201cChocolate Cupcakes\u201d from her 1974 book \u201cMaida Heatter\u2019s Book of Great Desserts,\u201d produced a rich, moist crumb that relies on cocoa powder for its deep chocolatey flavor. But it\u2019s her topping of semi-sweet chocolate ganache that separates these cupcakes from the crowd. No buttercream, no food coloring, and no diabetic shock after consumption. Just a really nice chocolate cake that\u2019s a bit on the small side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Suzanne Lenzer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/24/dining/24COOKING-CHOCOLATE-CUPCAKES2/23COOKING-CHOCOLATE-CUPCAKES2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "24 cupcakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, cakes", "keywords": "cake, chocolate, ganache, dessert, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 895}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 204, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "116 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups sifted all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch process)", "2/3 cup/5 1/3 ounces unsalted butter (1 1/3 sticks)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar", "3 eggs", "1 cup milk", "6 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips", "1/3 cup heavy cream", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees and line 4 6-cup muffin tins with cupcake liners.
