{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetable Torta", "description": "This torta is inspired by an award-winning one made by Laurie Figone of Petaluma, Calif. And her Pinhead Torta is a spin on a rice and egg torta, a sort of frittata made with eggs, rice, oregano and Parmesan. She substituted steel-cut oats for the rice, soaking and cooking the oats in mushroom broth, which contributed great flavor. She also added shredded zucchini, soaked portobello mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. This recipe is slightly different. Three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil are a substitute for Ms. Figone's 6 tablespoons of butter, and fresh garlic for garlic salt. There\u2019s also a choice between dried portobello mushrooms and dried porcinis. Serve the torta with a simple tomato sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/11/science/10recipehealth-1347296320547/10recipehealth-1347296320547-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 231, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "365 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce (about 1 cup) dried portobello mushrooms or 1/2 ounce dried porcinis", "1 1/2 cups boiling water", "1 1/2 cups quick-cooking steel-cut oats", "Salt to taste", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 cup diced onion", "1 cup coarsely shredded zucchini", "1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste), minced", "1/2 cup diced sun-dried tomatoes (packed in olive oil, drained)", "1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped fresh oregano, to taste, or 1/4 cup fresh marjoram", "6 eggs, at room temperature", "Freshly ground pepper", "4 ounces Parmesan, grated (1 cup)", "Fresh Tomato Sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the dried mushrooms in a bowl and pour on the boiling water.
