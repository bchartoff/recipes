{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Barbecue Country-Style Pork Ribs", "description": "This basic barbecue has big flavor and no ketchup or Coca-Cola (no disrespect meant to those who favor that type of seasoning). There\u2019s no fire involved; you use a standard oven. The spicing trends toward Caribbean, with plenty of sweet spice and as much Scotch bonnet or habanero chile heat as you wish. County-style ribs are meaty bone-in pork chops cut from the shoulder end of the loin, so use those or a whole bone-in pork shoulder roast. Cooked until it\u2019s ultratender, it can be cut in chunky pieces and served in its juices with beans, rice and cornbread. Or shred the cooked meat to make pulled pork sandwiches or tacos. It\u2019s quite good accompanied with a crisp slawlike cabbage salad or your favorite version of coleslaw.\n<strong></strong>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/dining/17kitchenrex/merlin_154283697_bf589b6e-b014-4ddd-baeb-fbe3046b2087-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "cabbage, molasses, orange, paprika, pork ribs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 154}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 pounds thick country-style pork ribs or whole bone-in pork shoulder roast", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons allspice berries", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds", "1 teaspoon whole cloves", "2 tablespoons smoked paprika, such as piment\u00f3n de la Vera", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon annatto powder (optional)", "6 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 cup molasses", "1/4 cup apple-cider vinegar", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 or 3 Scotch bonnet or habanero chiles, left whole but split to the stem (optional)", "4 bay leaves", "Soft buns or crusty rolls (optional)", "1 medium Savoy cabbage, cut into 1-inch-wide ribbons", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup orange juice (from 1 medium orange)", "3 tablespoons lime juice (from 1 large lime)", "1 tablespoon apple-cider vinegar", "1 small jalape\u00f1o chile, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions", "Cilantro sprigs, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
