{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bibingka (Filipino Coconut-Rice Cake)", "description": "This recipe for bibingka, the celebratory rice cake traditionally eaten around Christmastime in the Philippines, comes from the New York restaurateur Nicole Ponseca. It's a savory side dish with an edge of sweetness, and she always includes it on her Thanksgiving table. Cooked in cast-iron for a deeply golden crust, and hiding slices of salty preserved eggs, the bibingka is topped with grated cheese that gets brown and crisp. Though Ms. Ponseca prefers bibingka without additional coconut on top, traditionalists may want to add a sprinkle.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/dining/COOKING-BIBINGKA1/COOKING-FILIPINO1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cheddar, coconut milk, glutinous rice flour, rice flour, dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 140}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 633, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "457 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/320 grams rice flour", "1/2 cup/55 grams glutinous rice flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon salt", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/76 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more melted butter for topping, and butter for greasing pan", "1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters coconut milk", "3 eggs, lightly beaten", "1 banana leaf (optional)", "1 salted duck egg, sliced (optional)", "1 cup/80 grams grated queso de bola or Cheddar cheese", "1/2 cup/52 grams grated coconut, for topping (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
