Jerk is a wet seasoning that most often includes garlic, thyme, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, lime and soy sauce and is most often used on chicken.  Some of my favorite memories involving jerk chicken involve a long night at a beach bar, followed by a quick stop at a smoking grill on the side of the road for some spicy jerk chicken to fill me up before bed.
