With a sharp knife, cut the stack of sheets into six strips, the long way to yield six strips that measure 2 inches by 17 inches. Keep phyllo covered with plastic or a damp dish towel when not using. With a pastry brush, brush melted butter over the layer of phyllo you'll be working with. Put one teaspoon of filling at the bottom of 1 phyllo strip. Fold the lower right-hand corner up and to the left, so that the former bottom of the strip is now even with the left-hand side, making a little triangular pouch at the bottom of the strip.  Fold that pouch up.  Now fold that pocket back over to the right again, and continue that manner of back-and-forth folding all the way up the strip to form a triangular pouch Repeat until you\u2019ve made desired amount of trigona. Store trigona in fridge until ready to bake or freeze indefinitely. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 350\u00b0.
