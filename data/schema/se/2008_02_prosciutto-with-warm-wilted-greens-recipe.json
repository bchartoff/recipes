Put the vinaigrette in a stainless steel bowl or wok large enough to hold the greens comfortably, and place over a low heat. Add the greens, toss them continually with a pair of tongs or two forks for about 1 minute or until they are slightly wilted but have not gone entirely limp. Remove from the heat, and working directly from the bowl, place a small mixture of greens loosely on each prosciutto slice. Roll up and serve while still warm. </p>"}]}
