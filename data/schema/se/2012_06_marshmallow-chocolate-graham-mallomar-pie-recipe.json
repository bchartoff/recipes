Wash down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in clean water. Place the saucepan over medium heat and place a thermometer in the saucepan. Heat until sugar syrup reaches 240\u00b0F. Add bloomed gelatin and stir to combine. Return mixer to medium speed and whip egg whites until glossy and thick, about 1 minute (be careful not to overwhisk). Increase speed to high speed and drizzle in the hot sugar mixture slowly. Once the mixture is added, whisk on high speed for approximately 10 minutes, until marshmallow holds stiff peaks. Scrape the filling into the pie shell and chill for 4 hours.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Make the glaze:</strong> Melt the chocolate in the microwave in 15 second blasts, stirring between each blast.
