After about 30 minutes, when the custard is just slightly warm to the touch, put it in the refrigerator until completely cooled. Remove it from the refrigerator and whisk or use an electric hand mixer to whip the filling until it becomes fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Pour it into the prebaked pie shell, spreading it in an even layer.

Proceed as directed in the recipe. After you garnish the pie with whipped cream, sprinkle the reserved coconut evenly over the top.</p>"}]}
