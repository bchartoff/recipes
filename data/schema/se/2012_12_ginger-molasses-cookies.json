Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Pour the 1/4 cup sugar into a small bowl. Remove the dough from the fridge and form into approximately 1 tablespoon sized balls. Coat the balls lightly in the sugar and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12 minutes. They will appear undercooked but will harden as they cool. Remove from the oven, allow to cool a few minutes, and transfer to a plate or drying rack. Repeat until all the dough has been used, about 30 cookies. They can be stored in an airtight container for 4-5 days, but let's be honest, they won't last that long. </p>"}]}
