But mussels are just as quick and easy (if not easier) to prepare than fish, and they're a year-round sustainable source of seafood. Pop them in a pot of flavorful broth, and they'll be done before you can set the table. Adding even more reason to pick up a couple of pounds of shellfish is the <strong>Red Curry Mussels with Kimchi</strong> from <strong>Lauryn Chun's</strong> new <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Kimchi-Cookbook-Traditional-Modern/dp/1607743353/?tag=serieats-20\">Kimchi Cookbook</a></em>. Here, she swaps in kimchi for more traditional lemongrass in a coconut-red curry sauce. The kimchi brings funk, spice, and salinity to the broth, enhancing the creamy brininess of the mussels.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Clams, Mussels, and Oysters", "Coconut", "Cook the Book", "Mains"], "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons peeled, finely grated fresh ginger  ", "4 large garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons red curry paste", "1 cup finely chopped napa cabbage kimchi, plus additional for garnish", "2 (14-ounce) cans coconut milk", "1/4 cup water", "4 pounds mussels, rinsed and scrubbed", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice, plus more to taste (about 3 limes)", "1/4 cup finely chopped green onions (about 2 green onions) as garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a 5-quart Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.
