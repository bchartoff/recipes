Continue to cook for about 5 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is golden and caramelized.

Rather than putting your pastry down flat and rolling it out, place it on its side and roll it from there, this will give you a lighter, crisper texture.  Roll out the sheet of pastry until you have a rectangle shape about the same size as your pan and about 1/8 inch thick.  Drape your pastry over your rolling pin and carefully lay it on the roasting pan, gently tucking it around the bananas to make sure they're well covered, with no gaps.  Using a knife or fork, prick the pastry a few times.  Place the tray at the top of the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To serve your tart tatin: </strong>When your tart tatin is ready you must turn it out at once or it will end up sticking to the pan.
