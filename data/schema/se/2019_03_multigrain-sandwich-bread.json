It bakes up light and chewy, not crumbly, with a nibby crunch&mdash;perfect for your morning toast or favorite sandwich. The success of this recipe depends entirely on the powerful motor of a good food processor, not a mini-chopper, to achieve intensive gluten development in the whole wheat dough.

Process until dough is silky smooth, and a small piece can be stretched into a thin sheet without tearing, about 75 seconds. The exact timing will vary with the power and capacity of a given machine. For smaller machines, the reduced capacity and power will necessitate dividing dough in half to process in stages."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Once gluten is well developed, drizzle in the remaining water and oil while the processor is running, and continue mixing until roughly incorporated. Shut off the machine, add the prepared grain mixture, and continue processing only until homogenous.

To test, poke the dough gently with a flour-dusted fingertip; when dough is ready, it will retain a shallow impression that springs back after a minute. If dough is firm and springs back right away, continue proofing until dough retains a shallow impression. This will take about 75 minutes at around 70&deg;F (21&deg;C). Again, timing of the process will vary based on environmental conditions and is best judged by touch. Near the end of this period, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).

Immediately turn loaf out onto a wire rack, and cool completely before slicing, at least 90 minutes. Slice with a sharp serrated knife. The loaf will keep up to a week at room temperature in a bread box or paper bag."}]}
