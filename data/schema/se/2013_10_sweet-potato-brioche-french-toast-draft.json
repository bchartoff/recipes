Bake until juices caramelize and potatoes are baked through, 40-60 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, then peel off skin and cut into chunks, removing any blemished or overly stringy spots. Cut into large chunks and puree completely in a food processor. Measure out one cup, then another 1 1/4 cup for the filling and syrup, which can be refrigerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you don't have a food processor, the best way to puree the sweet potato is by forcing the warm baked potato chunks through a strainer. Press and scrape the puree with a plastic bowl scraper or sturdy spatula; you'll find that the tougher fibrous bits stay on the inside of the strainer and you can easily scrape the smooth puree from the bottom.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine warm water and yeast in bowl of stand mixer and set aside to dissolve, about 2 minutes.
