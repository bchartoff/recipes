From midnight until well after 2 a.m. he'd grill up bacon-wrapped dogs and finish them with pickled jalape\u00f1os and your choice of red or green salsa. Moving to New York has left a hole in my heart when it comes to this specific breed of dogs. To satisfy my craving I tried <strong><a href=\"http://www.robbwalsh.com/\">Robb Walsh</a></strong>'s version from <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tex-Mex-Grill-Backyard-Barbacoa-Cookbook/dp/0767930738/serieats-20\">The Tex-Mex Grill and Backyard Barbacoa Cookbook</a></em>.</strong>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Bacon", "Cook the Book", "Meats and Poultry", "Tex-Mex"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 teaspoons mayonnaise", "1 teaspoon Tabasco or other hot sauce", "Juice of 1 lemon", "4 all-beef wieners (fat ones work better than long ones)", "4 slices extra-thin bacon", "4 torpedo rolls or bolillos", "4 tablespoons warm refried beans (recipe follows)", "8 tablespoons chopped avocado or guacamole", "4 heaping tablespoons grated jack or cheddar cheese ", "4 tablespoons chopped onion", "4 tablespoons chopped tomato", "4 tablespoons Salsa Verde (recipe follows)", "1/4 cup lard, bacon grease, or vegetable oil", "3 cups drained cooked pinto beans", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 cup reserved bean broth", "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound tomatillos, husked and washed", "1 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "3 fresh serrano chiles, seeded and minced", "1 cup minced sweet onion", "2 teaspoons minced garlic", "Pinch of sugar", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice", "Sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Mix the mayo, Tabasco, and lemon juice and use a funnel to put the mayo blend in a squeeze bottle. Wrap the wieners with the bacon slices so the sausage is completely covered. Cook the wieners on a comal or flat top, rolling them over until the bacon is crunchy on all sides, about 7 minutes. Cut a pocket into the buns to form a \"boat\" and toast them on the grill. When the wieners are cooked, divide the beans and avocado among the four rolls, spooning them inside the pocket and spreading on either side. Spread the cheese down the middle. Using tongs put one piping-hot bacon-wrapped wiener into the pocket of each roll. Top each wiener with onions and tomatoes. Spread the Salsa Verde across the top. Apply the mayo blend in squiggles across the top of the hot dog.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<h4>Refried Beans</h4>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><em>- makes 3 cups -</em></p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Melt the lard in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
