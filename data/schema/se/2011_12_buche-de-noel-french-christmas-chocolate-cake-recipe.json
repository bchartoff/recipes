Draw an X across the center of a jelly roll pan with a small pat of butter and line the pan with parchment paper. Prepare a French meringue with the egg whites and sugar and whisk the meringue to stiff peaks in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. The meringue should be shiny and smooth, not puffy and dull. Whisk the egg yolks and fold them into the meringue, then fold in the cake flour, taking care not to deflate the batter. Fold in the cooled, melted butter. Immediately pour the batter onto the parchment-lined pan and spread it evenly with a large offset spatula. Bake the sponge for approximately 5-7 minutes, or until it is browned and springs back to the touch. Do not over-bake, or the sponge will be too stiff to roll. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then run a knife along the edges, place another piece of parchment on top and an inverted jelly roll pan atop the parchment, and flip the cake onto the inverted pan. Carefully peel off the parchment paper, and make the roulade as soon as the cake is cool to prevent hardening.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Assemble:</strong> With the sponge sitting on a piece of parchment, brush the cake with soaker using a pastry brush. Spread an even layer of pastry cream over the entire cake (between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick) using an offset spatula. Sprinkle small amounts of the cranberry compote over the surface. Using the parchment underneath to stabilize, begin rolling the cake into the roulade the long way, as you would a carpet, resting the roll on the seam. Cut the cake on an angle 1/3 way up the roulade using a serrated knife, then cut a round off of the bottom of the small piece. Arrange the bigger part of the roulade on a serving plate, and cover with a thick layer of buttercream. Arrange the smaller pieces so they look like branches coming out of the big roulade, then frost the smaller pieces with buttercream. Draw patterns in the buttercream to resemble bark, and decorate the cake as you see fit. The cake can be stored in the fridge until serving, but do not refrigerate the meringues or they will melt.</p>"}]}
