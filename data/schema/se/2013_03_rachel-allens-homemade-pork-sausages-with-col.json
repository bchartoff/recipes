Yet <strong><a href=\"http://www.rachelallen.co.uk/biog.html\">Rachel Allen's</a></strong> take on bangers and mash in her new book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rachels-Irish-Family-Food-classic/dp/0007462581/?tag=serieats-20\">Rachel's Irish Family Food</a></em> is sophisticated enough to warrant my serious attention. Her simple pork sausages are bound lightly with egg, bread crumbs, and a bit of garlic and parsley to season. Instead of going through with the trouble of casing the mixture, she simply rolls them into small, breakfast-sized links and gives them a slow brown on the stovetop. And in lieu of ordinary potatoes to serve alongside, Allen advocates for a verdant colcannon mash made velvety soft green cabbage buttery mashed russets. A dollop of quick stovetop applesauce adds a contrasting sweet-tart tang to each bite.", "totalTime": "1 hour", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Apple", "Cook the Book", "Mains", "Pork"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Sausages</strong>", "1 pound (450g) fatty ground (minced) pork ", "1 cup (50g) fresh bread crumbs ", "1 egg, lightly beaten ", "1 clove garlic, crushed ", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley or marjoram ", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons olive oil or sunflower oil ", "&nbsp", "<strong>Colcannon</strong>", "3 pounds (1.5kg) baking or russet (floury) potatoes, scrubbed ", "1/2 cup (100g) butter ", "1 pound, 2 ounces (500g) green cabbage, outer leaves removed", "2 tablespoons water", "1 cup (250ml) milk, heated", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "<strong>Applesauce:</strong>", "1 large cooking apple (12 ounces /350g), peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped ", "1 tablespoon water", "2 to 4 tablespoons (25\u201350g) sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To make the sausages:</strong> Mix together the pork, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, and parsley.
