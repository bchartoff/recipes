Top with about 7 1/4 ounces (205g) of prepared filling and spread into an even layer. Repeat with remaining cookies and cream, using up all the remaining cream so that the last cookie has no topping. Cover cake with foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and preferably no longer than 18 hours; chilling beyond this point may cause the cookie layer along the bottom to soften too much to be handled with ease."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<strong>To Serve:</strong> Just before serving, make a few chocolate curls by running a stick peeler down the long edge of a chocolate bar, with a sheet of wax or parchment paper placed underneath to catch the curls. This works best with milk chocolate at about 70&deg;F (21&deg;C); the chocolate may be too brittle at cooler temperatures and tacky when warmer. Dark chocolate can also be shaved using the same technique, but this tends to work best when the chocolate is a few degrees warmer, as it can be quite brittle for shaving even at 70&deg;F.

Slide an offset spatula or a wide, flat cookie spatula under the icebox cake, wiggle to loosen it from the pan, then slide your hand under and transfer the cake to a serving plate.

Some may find this messy state of affairs wonderfully soft, while others may consider it mush. Likewise, when the cake is served as soon as possible, the cookies will remain quite toothsome and crisp; for some, this provides the perfect textural contrast, while for others, they may seem too hard."}]}
