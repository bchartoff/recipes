Fill small sauce pan with 1\" of water and heat till simmering (not boiling). Place chocolate pieces in small stainless steal bowl and place bowl on top of sauce pan with simmering water. Be patient :) and wait till chocolate appears to be just barely melting (looks sticky on edges). Using rubber spatula, gently stir chocolate until it appears melted with bits still in it. Remove bowl from the pan and place it on a paper towel to absorb any water/condensation on bottom of bowl so no water makes its way into chocolate. Continue to stir until chocolate is completely melted. It should appear glossy, not grainy. Pour chocolate into ziplock bag and cut very small piece off corner of the bag and squeeze chocolate onto your cooled cookies.</p>"}]}
