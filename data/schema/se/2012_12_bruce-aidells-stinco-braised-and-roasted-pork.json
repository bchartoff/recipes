Sure, intrepid cooks may simmer osso bucco once in a lifetime, but it's rare to see a shank or two appear on the table. In <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Meat-Cookbook-Everything/dp/0547241410/?tag=serieats-20\">The Great Meat Cookbook</a></em>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.aidells.com/our-way/aidells-story\">Bruce Aidells</a></strong> presents a great case for bringing pork shanks to the holiday table with his recipe for <strong>Stinco</strong>. For this Italian-style pot roast, Aidells braises a couple of meaty shanks in a sumptuous sauce of white wine, porcinis, and prosciutto until quiveringly tender. The shanks then get a quick blast in a hot oven to brown and are then served on a soft bed of mashed potatoes, perfect for sopping up all of the potent sauce. The shanks make for an unconventional, yet dignified centerpiece for just about any holiday table.", "totalTime": "3 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Braising and Stewing", "Cook the Book", "Mains", "Pork", "Roasting"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms", "1 1/2 cups boiling water", "2 large or 4 small pork shanks (4 to 5 pounds total), trimmed of any skin or hair", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 ounces prosciutto or dried coppa, chopped", "2 cups chopped onions", "1 cup finely chopped peeled carrots", "1/2 cup chopped celery", "1 cup chopped leeks (white and pale green parts)", "2 tablespoons chopped garlic", "1 cup dry white wine", "1 cup homemade pork stock or canned low-sodium chicken broth, plus more if needed", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place the mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with the boiling water.
