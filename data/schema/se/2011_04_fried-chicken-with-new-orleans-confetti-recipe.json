Fry the chicken, turning with tongs, until the juices run clear when pierced to the bone with the tip of a sharp knife and the crust is deep golden brown and crispy, about 15 minutes per batch. Drain the chicken on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then serve hot, garnished with the pickles and a confetti of the garlic and parsley.</p>"}]}
