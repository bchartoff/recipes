It brightens many a rich dish, especially those made with fatty, gamy cuts like lamb blade chops. In <strong><a href=\"http://www.aidells.com/our-way/aidells-story\">Bruce Aidells'</a></strong> <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Meat-Cookbook-Everything/dp/0547241410/?tag=serieats-20\">The Great Meat Cookbook</a></em>, pomegranate molasses is used as a base for a <strong>braised-and-glazed lamb blade chop</strong> recipe. The dish as a whole is inspired by Turkish cuisine, with a spicy floral rub for the lamb, and a bright finishing sprinkle of fresh herbs (basil and mint), pomegranate seeds, and pine nuts. Aidells' lamb chops would be welcome on any winter time table, but would make an equally dashing holiday meal (as long as you're feeding open-minded diners).", "totalTime": "2 1/2 hours to 24 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 6", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Lamb", "Mains"], "recipeIngredient": ["6 lamb blade shoulder chops (about \u00bd pound each)", "&nbsp", "<strong>Turkish Spice Rub</strong>", "1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, or cayenne pepper", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "&nbsp", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon butter", "2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger", "1/2 cup finely chopped shallots", "1 cup finely chopped onions", "1 cup homemade lamb stock or canned low-sodium chicken broth", "1 cup pomegranate molasses or syrup", "2 pounds medium carrots of various colors, peeled and halved lengthwise", "1/2 pound parsnips, peeled and halved lengthwise", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "&nbsp", "<strong>Garnish</strong>", "1/2 cup fresh pomegranate seeds ", "1/4 cup toasted pine nuts ", "2 tablespoons shredded fresh basil leaves ", "2 tablespoons shredded fresh mint leaves "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Cut each chop into 2 pieces by cutting between the flat side of the blade bone and the meat.
