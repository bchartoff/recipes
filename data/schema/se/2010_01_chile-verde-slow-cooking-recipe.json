Trim any visible fat from the meat, and plop into your slow cooker stoneware. Add diced bell pepper and onion. If your tomatillos have the leafy-outer skin left on them, take the skin and stem off, and dice finely (I used a handheld chopper). Pour in the contents of the diced chile can and the tomato can. Add spices. Stir a bit to get the spices down the sides of the meat. Add chopped cilantro to the top.  Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, on high for 6 hours, or until the meat shreds easily with a fork.  Serve with rice, corn tortillas, shredded cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.</p>"}]}
