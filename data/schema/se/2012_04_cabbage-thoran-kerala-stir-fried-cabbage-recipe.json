In quick succession add the turmeric and cumin powders and stir vigorously to ensure the spices don't burn, but the oil turns yellow, about ten seconds. Add the cabbage and salt and stir fry until just starting to wilt, about 1 minute. Put the lid on and let the cabbage cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove lid, if the cabbage has released water, turn the heat up and dry it off. Once dry, add the grated coconut and stir until it's nicely mixed into the cabbage, about 30 seconds.
