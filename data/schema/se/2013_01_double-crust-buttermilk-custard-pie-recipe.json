If you'd like a little additional color on the top of the pie, move the rack to the center for the last ten minutes of baking, which will encourage browning. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving, or cool to room temperature and then place in the fridge. Best if consumed within 24 hours of baking.</p>"}]}
