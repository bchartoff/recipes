Pour mixture into the flour-onion paste, stirring with a whisk to prevent lumps. Return the pan to medium heat and bring the sauce to the boiling point. Stir constantly to prevent chiles from scorching until bubbles form. When the sauce just begins to show signs of active boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 2 to 3 minutes more. Make sure to stir a few times, reaching thoroughly around the bottom and sides of the pan to catch any lumps beginning to form. When the sauce is thickened, and smooth, add the salt, beginning with the smaller amount. Remove from heat and set aside until needed. The finished red chile sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon heavily. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><small><a href=\"http://www.istockphoto.com/user_view.php?id=1903949\" class=\"istock\">\u00a9iStockphoto.com/ilmwa555</a></small></p>"}]}
