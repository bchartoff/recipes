In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, brown sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon. Add bread cubes. Stir in the dried fruit. Pour the mixture into a greased stoneware insert. Cover (no need to prop open lid) and cook on low for 3 to 5 hours, or on high for 2 to 3 hours. Your bread pudding is finished when the top has browned, and you can push on the pieces of bread without too much liquid squirting out.  If desired, add raw sugar to the very top and caramelize with a kitchen torch.  </p>"}]}
