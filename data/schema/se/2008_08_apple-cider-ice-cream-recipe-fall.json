Boil until the cider is as thick as maple syrup and the sugar has caramelized, about 15 minutes. As the cider reduces in volume, it will bubble up to the top of the pan. When this happens, lift the pan off the heat, swirl it until the bubbles subside, and then continue cooking; reduce the heat slightly if the mixture refuses to simmer down. When it is the right consistency, the bubbles will be very thick, large, and foamy and you\u2019ll have between 1/2 and 2/3 cup of syrup. A sure test that the syrup is ready is an instant-read thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat, tip it at an angle so that the syrup collects at one side, and insert the thermometer&mdash;the temperature should be 240\u00baF. Remove the cinnamon stick.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>While the syrup is cooking, scald the cream and milk in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat.

Very gradually, whisk in the hot cider syrup mixture. Scrape the mixture into the saucepan and set the pan over medium-low heat.
