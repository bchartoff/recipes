Especially when you lay it on a bed of green lentils sauteed in garlic and fresh spinach leaves.  French green lentils&mdash;which hold their shape well when cooked, resisting mushiness&mdash;are a high-protein healthy component that help counteract the decadence.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Beans and Pulses", "Dinner Tonight", "Salads", "Spinach", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["11 ounces fresh goat cheese", "1/4 cup flour, for dredging", "1 large egg, beaten", "1/2 cup panko or breadcrumbs", "1 cup olive oil", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 1/2 cup green lentils (preferably De Puy variety)", "1/2 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1/2 cup neutral oil, such as canola", "4 cups fresh spinach leaves", "Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "Sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Add the lentils to a pot and cover with a couple inches water and a good pinch or two of salt.
