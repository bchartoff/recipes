Season with salt and set aside. Cook ravioli by submerging in boiling water and cooking for 3 minutes (ravioli should float). Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of cooking liquid. Transfer ravioli and liquid to pot with browned butter. Heat over high heat, gently folding and tossing until a rich, emulsified sauce is formed, about 1 minute. Serve immediately.</p>"}]}
