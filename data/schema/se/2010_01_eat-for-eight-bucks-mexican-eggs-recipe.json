When the tortilla strips are quite crispy, push them up against the edges of the skillet, leaving a bare spot in the middle. If it looks very dry, add another spoonful of oil. Then pour the eggs into the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and let them sit for a minute. Scramble the eggs in the middle of the skillet, drawing in bits of crispy tortilla as necessary; by the end, everything should be mixed together. About a minute before the eggs are done to your liking, sprinkle the rest of the cheese all over and give them a stir. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Toss in the cilantro and serve right away with more salsa, if you have it, on the side, as well as roasted potatoes and refried beans.</p>"}]}
