All of these treats are possible thanks to a humble childhood snack: <strong>the graham cracker.</strong> S'mores probably weren't what Sylvester Graham had in mind back in 1829 when he created a \"honey health biscuit\" made from whole grains. Most of today's graham crackers are made from refined wheat flour. If you are on a gluten-free diet, this is a problem. However, <strong>gluten-free grahams are easy to make at home.</strong> And even if you aren't gluten-free, making homemade graham crackers is a fun&mdash;and tasty&mdash;way to experience classic graham crackers in a new way.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "about 12 graham crackers", "recipeCategory": ["Bread", "Desserts", "Gluten-Free", "Gluten-Free Tuesday"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Dry ingredients: </strong>", "1 1/2 cups brown rice flour", "1/2 cup cornstarch", "1/3 cup dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "<strong>Wet ingredients: </strong>", "5 tablespoons butter, cold", "6 tablespoons milk", "3 tablespoons honey"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.
