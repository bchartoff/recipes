Retrieve the butter cubes from the freezer and distribute them evenly in the flour mixture, coating them with the flour mixture. Sink your fingers into the mixture and begin pinching the butter and flour together, making thin, floury disks of the butter. Continue working the mixture until the butter is broken down first into floury pea-sized beads and then into a loose mixture that resembles wet sand. Drizzle in 3 tablespoons of the ice water and use your hand like a comb to mix in the liquid just until the dough holds together.

Now, lay a dough circle on top of the filling in each jar, and use your fingers or a fork to tease the edges of the crusts gently together. Cut a few small slashes in the top of each pie to allow the steam to vent. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.
