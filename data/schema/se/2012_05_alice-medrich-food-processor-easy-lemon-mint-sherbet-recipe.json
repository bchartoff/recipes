Instead of breaking out the ice cream maker, she's come up with an innovative method to make smooth, lemony sherbet by freezing the base and then whizzing it in the bowl of the food processor, aerating it, and then returning to the freezer to firm it up a bit more.  It's bright, fresh, and even a little sparkly, and the best part is there's no need to dust off the ice cream maker.", "totalTime": "4 hours 30 minutes", "recipeYield": "makes 3 1/3 cups", "recipeCategory": ["Desserts", "Ice Cream and Frozen Treats", "Lemon"], "recipeIngredient": ["A very large handful of fresh mint leaves", "1 cup (7 ounces) sugar", "1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 3 medium lemons; grate the zest before juicing \u2028the lemons)", "2 2/3 cups 1% or whole milk", "1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest (preferably organic or unsprayed) "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Reserve a few mint leaves for garnish.
