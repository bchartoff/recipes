So when I came across this recipe for <strong>Orange-Glazed Olive Oil Cake with Fleur de Sel</strong> from <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Finish-Special-Desserts-Occasion/dp/0393059537/serieats-20\">The Perfect Finish</a></em> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Yosses\">Bill Yosses</a>, I made sure I had all the ingredients on hand, then made a beeline for the kitchen to start baking.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Orange"], "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter, for the pan", "2  navel oranges or thin-skinned juice oranges, such as Valencia ", "2 1/3 cups sugar ", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour ", "2 teaspoons baking powder ", "1 teaspoon baking soda ", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract ", "1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel ", "<strong>For the orange glaze:</strong>", "1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (from about 1 medium orange)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a large pot, bring 3 quarts water to a boil.
