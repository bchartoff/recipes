The cheese sticks kept melting in the hot oil. Instead of crispy sticks with oozy centers, I had cheese that was a runny mess. Then I remembered a technique I hadn't used in years: double dipping during the first part of the standard breading procedure. While double dipping is never, ever welcome at parties, it's more than welcome in this recipe.", "totalTime": "20 minutes", "recipeYield": "six", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Cheese", "Gluten-Free", "Gluten-Free Tuesday"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces (1 cup) white rice flour", "1 teaspoon dried basil", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "Pinch (little less than 1/8 teaspoon) granulated garlic", "Pinch freshly ground black pepper", "2 large eggs, beaten", "5 ounces (1 cup) dried gluten-free bread crumbs", "12 pieces string cheese, cold and unwrapped ", "Vegetable Oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Line up three plates on your counter.
