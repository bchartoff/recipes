They will become really light, fluffy and mousselike. Add the sugar and keep whisking. The sugar will make the eggs increase in bulk even more. To test if the eggs are whisked up enough, use a spoon to pick up some of the egg mixture and then drop it back down. If the eggs are whisked up enough, the spoonful will sit on the surface for about 5 seconds (if it sits longer, that\u2019s brilliant too!) before disappearing back into the mixture. Once the egg mixture reaches this stage, it is ready.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Give the now-melted chocolate a little stir into the butter to blend and pour it around the edges of the egg mixture. Do this from a low height so you don\u2019t knock out all of that wonderful air that you have just beaten in. Then, using a spatula, fold them together, scooping right down to the bottom of the bowl, as the chocolate tends to sink down there. Sprinkle the flour, baking powder and salt over and fold the mixture in using as few \u201cfolds\u201d as possible so you keep all that air in, but enough folds to make sure there are no lumps of flour in there. Finally, gently fold in the strawberries and pistachios.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Gently pour the mixture into the prepared pan from a low height and level it out with the back of a spoon.

It will collapse in the center a little, but don\u2019t worry\u2014it will taste great. Once cooled, carefully remove from the pan, peel off the paper and cut into eight rectangular bars or 16 bite-size squares and serve.
