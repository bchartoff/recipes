Our version of Pineapple Upside Down Cake uses fresh fruit instead of canned, and a Pyrex dish instead of a cast iron skillet (although a cast iron skillet will work brilliantly if you happen to have one in your cupboard).  Make sure to remove the cake from the pan while it's still a bit warm, and make sure your platter is larger then you think you need.  I find it much easier to un-mold a slightly hot cake onto a slightly larger platter.", "totalTime": "65 minutes", "recipeYield": "4-6", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Cakes", "Pineapple"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Pineapple Topping:</strong>", "3/4 stick butter", "3/4 cup brown sugar", "1/2 ripe pineapple, peeled and cut into 1 inch thick pieces", "&nbsp;", "<strong>Cake:</strong>", "1 1/2 cup all purpose flour", "2 teaspoon baking powder", "pinch of salt", "3/4 stick room temperature butter", "1 cup sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 tablespoon crown royal (or whiskey or rum of preference)", "1/2 cup pineapple juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For Pineapple Topping: </strong> Butter 8x8 Pyrex dish and arrange pineapple slices in an overlapping circle (or as close as you can manage it).
