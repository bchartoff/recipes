Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Hold the steak up over the marinating dish and wipe excess marinade off with your hand; you just don't want it to be swimming in oil, so you don't need to dry it off completely. Lay the steak on the lined baking sheet and broil 4 minutes per side. Allow the steak to rest while you prepare the rest of dinner and then slice very thin across the grain.</p>"}]}
