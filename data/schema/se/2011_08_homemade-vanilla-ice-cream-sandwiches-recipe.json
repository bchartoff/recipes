With a hand or stand mixer, cream together butter, sugars, salt, baking soda, powder, espresso, and vanilla on medium speed. Mix for about two minutes, just until combined. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then (with the machine still running) add in the yolks, one at a time. During this process, shut off the mixer and scrape the bowl down with a rubber spatula once or twice. Reduce mixing speed to low and dump in the flour and cocoa all at once. Mix until the dry ingredients have fully incorporated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the mixer still running on low, drizzle in the hot coffee a little at a time. About halfway through, stop the mixer and scrape the bowl down. Continue drizzling in the coffee to transform the dough into a paste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, it should have a smooth cake-batter like consistency. If you notice any lumps, crank up the mixer speed to medium and beat until the lumps have disappeared. If a few remain, don't worry; they'll bake out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Divide the batter evenly between the two sheet pans (roughly 15 ounces each). Use an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread the batter into a thin layer; you don't need the batter to reach to the very corners, it only needs to cover a 10\" by 14\" area. Rap the sheet pans against the counter to help level the batter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bake for about 7-10 minutes, or until the cookie-sheets have puffed up and become firm to the touch. Cool thoroughly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For greatest ease of handling, refrigerate or freeze the wafers before proceeding.
