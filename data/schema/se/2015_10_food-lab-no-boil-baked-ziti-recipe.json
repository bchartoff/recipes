There are few pasta bakes that are easier to put together yet produce such ridiculously good results, particularly when it's snowing outside and you've got a whole cabinful of friends to feed. The noodles get tossed with a pink mixture of tomato sauce, cream, and ricotta cheese, with a couple of eggs thrown in to lend structure to the casserole as it cooks. I also like to toss cubes of mozzarella cheese together with the pasta to form gooey, stretchy pockets. I top the whole thing with some more marinara, more cubes of mozzarella, and a grating of Parmesan.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCategory": ["Italian", "Mains", "Pasta", "The Food Lab", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ziti, penne, or other thick tubular pasta", "6 cups <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/09/easy-italian-amercian-red-sauce-recipe.html\">homemade</a> or high-quality store-bought red sauce (such as Rao's)", "12 ounces whole-milk <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/how-to-make-fresh-ricotta-fast-easy-homemade-cheese-the-food-lab-recipe.html\">homemade</a> or high-quality ricotta cheese (see note)", "3 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated (about 11\u20442 cups)", "2 large eggs, beaten", "1 cup heavy cream", "3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley", "3 tablespoons minced fresh basil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound whole-milk mozzarella cheese, cut into rough 1/4-inch cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 400&deg;F.
