Heat a grill, cast-iron griddle, or heavy-bottomed ridged pan until really hot. (If you fear the bars on your grate are too widely set for the tentacles, put a mesh screen on top of the grate.) Lay the pieces of squid on it, diamond side up, and the tentacles as they fall. Let them cook for just 1 minute, then turn them all over. Cook for a minute more. The butterflied squid pieces will want to curl up, so flip them over one more time to encourage them to do so, and allow the curled up pieces to get a final minute of cooking.
