The flavor of meat confited in olive oil tends to be a little lighter than meat cooked in duck fat and certainly lard, but the real advantage of confiting in olive oil is that you don't have to track down good-quality animal fat. Any bottle of olive oil will do and after you have used the oil to confit the meat, you can use it again to roast your vegetables.", "totalTime": "4 hours cooking plus overnight salting", "recipeYield": "serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Mains", "Offal", "The Nasty Bits", "Turkey"], "recipeIngredient": ["One turkey, cut up into wings, thighs, and gizzards and heart, about five pounds", "2 teaspoons kosher salt per pound of meat", "1 onion, diced", "Crushed black pepper", "\u00a0", "<strong>For confiting:</strong>", "4 cups olive oil, or enough to completely cover the meat", "1 head of garlic, the ends cut off to expose the cloves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a large nonreactive mixing bowl, toss the turkey parts with the salt, pepper, and onion.
