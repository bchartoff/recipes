Pour bacon into a fine mesh sieve set over a heat-proof bowl.  Once the fat has drained into the bowl, set aside and allow to cool to room temperature.  Turn bacon bits out onto paper towels.  Bits and fat can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week before use, just be sure to bring the fat to room temperature before making the cookie dough.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><a name=\"note2\"></a>** You can use the same quantity of old-fashioned oats in this recipe, but I\u2019ve found that the cookies have a little more structure, a slightly nicer texture and bake into more attractive&mdash;less lumpy and irregular&mdash;circles with the quick oats.</p>"}]}
