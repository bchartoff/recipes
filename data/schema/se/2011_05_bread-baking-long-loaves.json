What they are, though, is good. My secret weapon, semolina flour, adds a richness to the bread that I love. These are softer loaves. Still substantial, but also a bit airy. They're perfect for sandwiches&mdash;soft enough to bite into without breaking teeth or gouging the roof of your mouth with sharp crusty shards, but hearty enough to stand up to whatever fillings you choose.", "totalTime": "2 hours, 30 minutes", "recipeYield": "Makes 4 loaves", "recipeCategory": ["Bread", "Bread Baking"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups lukewarm water", "1 tablespoon yeast", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1/2 cup semolina flour", "1 pound, 2 ounces (about 3 1/4 cups ) bread flour", "2 teaspoons salt", "2 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine the water, yeast, sugar, and semolina flour in the bowl of your stand mixer and set aside until it's bubbly, about 10 minutes.
