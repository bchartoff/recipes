When shallots are light golden brown, transfer to strainer and drain. (Shallots will continue cooking for a brief period after draining, so do not allow them to get too dark). Immediately transfer to paper towel-lined tray and season with salt. Allow shallots to drain, then carefully lift the top layer of paper towels and roll shallots onto second layer, blotting gently with the first.
