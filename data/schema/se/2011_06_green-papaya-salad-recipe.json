Dressed in fish sauce, lime, and chilies, the shreds of papaya are sweet and refreshing. The salad can be as simple or complex as you choose&mdash;for a vegetarian salad, stick with other vegetables that also benefit from being dressed in lime and fish sauce, such as carrots, daikon, and cucumbers. Parboiled shrimp and squid are fine additions. Another Vietnamese favorite uses shreds of Asian beef jerky, which softens as it soaks up some of the lime and chili dressing.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["No-Cook", "Salads", "Thai"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 green papaya, about 2 pounds", "1 large carrot", "3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro", "\u00a0", "<strong>For the dressing:</strong>", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (about 2 limes)", "3 tablespoons fish sauce", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1 clove garlic, grated with a microplane grater or finely minced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To make the dressing: combine all the ingredients and set aside to let the sugar dissolve.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Peel the papaya with a vegetable peeler or sharp knife.
