The chicken is flavorful with garlic, olive oil, and herbs. The potatoes are perhaps even better: they get seasoned with the chicken's juices, plus more olive oil and more herbs. But easy as it may be, roasting a whole chicken isn't that cheap, and it takes a while. So I've been experimenting with roasting chicken thighs and legs, and adding flavor even during a shorter cooking time.", "totalTime": "3 hours", "recipeYield": "2", "recipeCategory": ["Chicken", "Eat for Eight Bucks", "Mains", "Potato"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon cider vinegar", "2 tablespoons maple syrup", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon whole grain mustard", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "freshly ground pepper", "4 chicken thighs, bone-in and skin on (1-1.25lb)", "1 1/2 lb large Yukon Gold potatoes", "2 tablespoons white wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a bowl large enough to hold the chicken, combine the vinegar, maple syrup, 1 tablespoon olive oil, mustard, \u00bd teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of freshly ground pepper.
