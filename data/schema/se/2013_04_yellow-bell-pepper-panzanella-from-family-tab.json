After all, the beauty of panzanella is that you get to eat tons of bread and still call it a \"healthy\" salad, right? The Yellow Bell Pepper Panzanella in <strong><a href=\"http://www.ushgnyc.com/people/leadership/michael-romano/\">Michael Romano</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.karenstabiner.com/site/biography\">Karen Stabiner's</a></strong> <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Family-Table-Favorite-Staff-Restaurants/dp/0547615620/?tag=serieats-20\">Family Table</a></em> is a prime example of the form. Made mostly of caramelized onions and bell peppers, this panzanella has all of the vibrancy of the original without running the risk of eating a mealy tomato. Capers and a generous amount of torn basil are key to perking up the rich sweetness of the vegetables.", "totalTime": "1 hour", "recipeYield": "serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Bread", "Cook the Book", "Mains", "Salads", "Sides", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup olive oil", "1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced", "4 yellow bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into thin strips", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 cups cut or torn 1-inch chunks day-old bread", "2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and drained", "2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 cups torn fresh basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat.
