(It can be difficult to take an accurate temperature on such a thin cut of meat, so make sure to confirm doneness by eye; it's okay to make a small slit into one of the breasts with a knife to confirm.) If second side browns before chicken is done, move to cool side of grill, cover, and let cook until chicken is ready. Remove chicken from grill, let rest 5 minutes, then serve immediately.</p>"}]}
