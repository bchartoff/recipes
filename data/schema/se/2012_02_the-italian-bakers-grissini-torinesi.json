The baker\u2019s method of shaping breadsticks is ingenious, simple, and quick, for he certainly doesn\u2019t have time to roll out individual grissini. Cut the dough crosswise into four equal sections and then cut each section crosswise again into five strips, each about the width of a fat finger. The dough is so elastic that you can simply pick up each piece, hold each end with your fingers, and pull and stretch to fit the width (or length) of a baking sheet. Place the breadsticks several inches apart on lightly oiled baking sheets (I find it easier to use the backs of the baking sheets, unless you have rimless sheets). There is no need to let them rise.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Baking:</strong> Preheat the oven to 450\u00baF.
