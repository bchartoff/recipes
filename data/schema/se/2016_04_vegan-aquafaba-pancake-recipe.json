In a stand mixer, that liquid can be transformed into a creamy, fine, stable foam with the texture, density, and many of the cooking properties of an egg white&ndash;based meringue.

Use a 1/4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip pancakes and cook on second side until golden brown and completely set, about 3 minutes longer. Serve pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and vegan butter.</p>"}]}
