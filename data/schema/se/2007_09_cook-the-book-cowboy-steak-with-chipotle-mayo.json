This leaves an empty space next to the coals or between them.  If you are grilling on a gas grill, only one or two burners are lit.  Food cooked over indirect heat often is started over direct heat and then moved to the cooler (empty) part of the grill for even, slow cooking.  To make the heat as even as possible, construct two piles of coals or leave the center gas burner off and light those on either side of it.  Do not prepare the gas grill for indirect grilling by preheating only one of two burners.  Let the grill preheat with all burners on high as usual, and then turn off one or more.</p>"}]}
