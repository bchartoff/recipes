Heat 1 inch of peanut oil over medium-high heat in a stable wok or a wide shallow pot. When the oil is hot, toss in the noodles. If they start to brown immediately, lower the heat slightly. Fry, moving them around to prevent scorching, until they crisp and curl and just start to change color. Use tongs or a spider to lift them out of the hot oil, pausing to let excess oil drain off, then transfer to a plate. Pour off the oil; it can be used for another purpose. Fried noodles will keep for a week if stored, once completely cooled, in a well-sealed glass jar.<br />\r\n</p>"}]}
