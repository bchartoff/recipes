You might even get a few durian converts if you serve the fruit in smoothie form, which offers a milder kick of that distinctive cheesy taste.", "totalTime": "10 minutes", "recipeYield": "2", "recipeCategory": ["Asian", "Smoothie"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup durian fruit ", "1 banana", "About 1 1/2 cups ice cubes", "1/2 cup water, milk, or soymilk", "1 tablespoon condensed milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place everything into a blender and blend until smooth, adding more condensed milk to taste.
