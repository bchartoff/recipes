Compared to store-bought, the flavor is cleaner and more vibrant, less dull and chalky. It's a perfect match for lamb, which in this recipe is mixed with <strong>cinnamon, almonds, and a final sprinkling of smoked paprika.</strong> Each bite is tangy, rich, and gorgeously perfumed thanks to the spices.
