Somewhere between a simmer and a full boil, turn off the heat and add the jasmine tea pearls, which should promptly unfurl as you stir briefly. Be careful not to simmer the mixture for too long, because the simple syrup evaporates quickly, reducing the amount of liquid remaining. You want 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (9 fl oz) to work with. If, after 1 minute, the smell of jasmine is not pronounced, add more jasmine. It\u2019s a really subtle flavor and has a habit of hiding under the rhubarb, so make sure it\u2019s really present in the simple syrup to begin with. Steep for 10 minutes and then strain out the jasmine, pressing down on the flowers to extract as much liquid as possible. Let cool. Can you still smell it? If not, add more and reboil. Jasmine is subtle!<br />\n</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pour about 1/2 inch of water into a shallow, heavy, nonreactive saucepan and add the chopped rhubarb.
