After the dough\u2019s resting period, knead it&mdash;by hand, mixer or bread machine&mdash;until you have a cohesive, very stiff dough. This dough won\u2019t be very elastic; that\u2019s ok.

This will take 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. Be aware that this bread has very little oven spring, so what you see when you put it in the oven is pretty much what you\u2019ll get coming out of the oven.
