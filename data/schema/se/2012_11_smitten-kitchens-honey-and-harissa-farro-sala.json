They're earthy, filling, and entirely seasonal. In <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Smitten-Kitchen-Cookbook-Perelman/dp/030759565X/?tag=serieats-20\">The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook</a></em>, <strong><a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/about/#Deb\">Deb Perelman</a></strong> writes about a few such salads, but the one that drew my eye was her <strong>Honey and Harissa Farro Salad</strong>. I'm a big <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harissa\">harissa</a> fan, and the idea of tempering its spiciness with honey sounded like a perfect dressing base. But what the title of the recipes leaves out is that over half of this salad is made up of roasted batons of carrots and parsnips-two of my favorite fall staples. And if you're lucky enough to live in a place with choices in your carrots, go for a rainbow of colors for a vibrant fall meal.", "totalTime": "50 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Mains", "Other Grains", "Salads", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Farro</strong>", "1 cup (215 grams) uncooked farro", "4 cups (950 ml) water or broth", "&nbsp", "<strong>Vegetables</strong>", "2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil", "1/2 pound (225 grams, about 4 medium) carrots", "1 pound (455 grams, about 2 large) parsnips", "Salt", "&nbsp", "<strong>Dressing</strong>", "5 tablespoons (75 ml) olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon harissa, or to taste", "1 teaspoon honey", "2 tablespoons (30 ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste", "Pinch of ground cumin", "Salt", "1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves, or half parsley and half mint", "3/4 cup (4 ounces or 113 grams) crumbled feta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Cook farro:</strong> Bring the farro, water or broth, and a few pinches of salt (if using water or unsalted broth) to a boil.
