We purposely undercook our chicken so it can simmer in a creamy spiced tomato and cream sauce before serving.\r\n\r\nWhen done right, the sauce should be a multifaceted affair; a balanced blend of intense spice flavors with a gingery kick rounded off by the richness of cream and butter, with a splash of freshness and acid from tomatoes and citrus. As you bite into a chunk of chicken, the smokey char should work its way though to the forefront, to be slowly replaced by a new layer of spicing, this time intensified by its time on the grill. The chicken chunks should be juicy, moist, and tender.", "totalTime": "5 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Chicken", "Indian", "The Food Lab"], "recipeIngredient": ["5 pounds bone-in chicken pieces (breasts, legs, or a mix), skin removed", "3 tablespoons toasted ground cumin", "3 tablespoons toasted paprika", "2 tablespoon toasted ground coriander seed", "2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "12 cloves garlic, grated on the medium holes of a box grater, divided", "3 tablespoons fresh ginger, grated on the medium holes of a box grater, divided", "2 cups yogurt", "3/4 cup fresh juice from 4 to 6 lemons, divided", "Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume", "4 tablespoons butter or ghee", "1 large onion, thinly sliced", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, roughly mashed", "1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 cup heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place the chicken pieces on a cutting board with the flesh-side up.
