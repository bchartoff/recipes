Place the frying pan over medium heat. Melt the butter in the pan, tilting it to evenly coat the bottom. Sprinkle the sugar over the butter and tilt the pan to evenly disperse the sugar. When the sugar just begins to melt and brown slightly, place the fruit in the pan. Saute the fruit on each side for two minutes, taking care not to dent the fruit on the round side that will face up in the final tart. The fruit should only be slightly cooked. Add the cider to deglaze the pan and position the fruit around the pan, packed tightly together, with the cut side facing up. Remove the pan from heat. Cover the top of the apples with the chilled pastry and tuck all of the overhanging dough down along the inside of the pan, so it creates a crust around the apples. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 20 minutes at 400&deg;F, then reduce the temperature to 350&deg;F and bake until the crust is a deep golden brown and very firm to the touch with the juices bubbling vigorously beneath the crust, about 20 minutes longer. Remove the tart from the oven and allow it to sit for one minute.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Using oven mitts or kitchen towels, place an inverted plate of greater size than the pan over the top of the tart. Grasp the plate and hold it firmly against the pan. Working swiftly, invert the pan so that the plate is on the bottom and the tart is flipped with the fruit on top. Remove the pan and take caution, the juices from the fruit will be very hot. Allow them to drip out of the pan and onto the tart. Allow the tart to cool for 10 minutes  before serving warm, or place in the oven for 5 minutes before serving. </p>"}]}
