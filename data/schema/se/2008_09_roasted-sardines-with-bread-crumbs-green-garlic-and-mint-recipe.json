First, using a sharp pairing knife, make a slit along the belly of the fish. Pry the fish open and scrape and rinse out its innards. Next, lay the fish, flesh side down, on a work surface. Grasping the tail and working from tail to head, drag the blunt edge of the knife the length of the fish to remove the scales. Rinse the fish well, pat dry, and repeat with the remaining fish, then clean your work surface before proceeding.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Working with one fish at a time, remove the head. Gently pry open the belly to reveal the backbone. Place the fish, skin side up, on a work surface and run the palm of your hand along the spine to loosen it, then trim off the back fin. Turn the sardine over. Starting at the head end, pull the backbone towards the tail in a single motion. (Part of the tail may come off with the backbone.) Rinse the sardine under cold running water, checking for any loose bones, and then pat dry. Repeat with the remaining sardines.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Arrange the butterflied sardines on a baking sheet, skin side up.

Over medium-low heat, replenish the saut\u00e9 pan with a few additional tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle in the bread crumbs.
