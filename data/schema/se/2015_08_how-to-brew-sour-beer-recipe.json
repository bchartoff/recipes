Ladle all 1.5 gallons of water from your hot liquor tank over the grains in the colander, rinsing off any additional sugars on the surface of the grains.

Bring to a boil over high heat, then stir in herbs. After 15 minutes, smell steam to ensure no aroma of cooked corn (DiMethyl Sulfide, or DMS).

If you can detect DMS aroma in the steam, keep boiling until it is no longer apparent.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>As you end the boil, switch off heat, and place thermometer in the wort. Pour 2 gallons of refrigerated purified water into the kettle, increasing volume to 5 gallons and dropping the temperature between 120 to 130&deg;F. Stir vigorously with a large spoon to cool further if temperature is a little on the high side. Once at temperature, pour all liquid and solids from bacterial starter from step 1 directly into kettle. Cover tightly with foil or plastic wrap and insulate with a thick bath towel, holding at temperature for 24 hours to ensure sufficient acid formation. Because fermentation generates heat, the simple insulation is enough to stay above 100&deg; overnight, ideal growing temperature for lactic acid-producing bacteria.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>24 hours later, sanitize your fermentation carboy by diluting 1 teaspoon of Starsan sanitizer in a gallon of water inside the carboy. Shake up and roll the carboy on its side to ensure the liquid touches all interior surfaces and the opening. Pour out when complete. Pour off 10 ounces of your storebought unpasteurized sour beer (reserve for your well-deserved enjoyment), reserving just over 3 ounces (about the bottom quarter of the bottle) of liquid and yeast and bacteria-rich dregs from the bottom. Using an auto-siphon device, transfer soured wort into carboy, then pour in the remaining liquid and dregs into the carboy. Add an airlock and rubber stopper to the top, then set in a cool location in the high 60s to low 70s to favor yeast activity over further bacterial growth and souring.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Taste periodically, using your pipette reserved for sour beers, starting at about 2 weeks from initial brew day.

If the buttery flavor has dissipated and the beer tastes \u201cbright,\u201d use a sanitized hydrometer, testing jar, and pipette to take a sample.

This should yield approximately 48 12-ounce bottles. Alternatively, transfer to sanitized keg and carbonate following keg carbonation instructions. For natural carbonation, the beer should be ready in 2 to 3 weeks.</p>"}]}
