If the buns aren't touching, you'll have some topping on the bottom of the buns after they bake, but that's fine. Try to get most of it on top of the buns, however. Bake the buns at 350\u00b0F until they are nicely browned, about 30 minutes. Remove them from the pan, peel the parchment off the bottom, and let them cool, at least a little bit.
