Dismiss it as a G&amp;T wannabe, however, and you're missing out on one of the great joys of summer. Created in a Washington, D.C., bar called <strong>Shoemaker's</strong> during an especially brutal heat wave in the 1890s--before the advent of air conditioning, you'll note--the gin rickey is like an effervescent Frigidaire. Refreshingly bubbly and pleasantly bitter, this Gilded Age cooler demonstrates how your great-grandparents made it through the summer alive.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "makes 1 cocktail", "recipeCategory": ["Gin"], "recipeIngredient": ["Half a well-washed lime", "2 ounces London dry gin", "Chilled club soda", "Optional: splash simple syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Fill a 10-ounce Collins glass with ice.
