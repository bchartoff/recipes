Pierogi are boiled and then pan fried half-moon dumplings usually filled with some kind of meat, cheese, or potato filling. Pierogi are usually made en masse as a celebratory meal, since all of the kneading, rolling, filling, and boiling can take the better part of a day. <a href=\"http://www.anneapplebaum.com/\">Anne Applebaum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.daniellecrittenden.com/\">Danielle Crittenden's</a> recipe, however, is scaled back to make just enough pierogi for 4 people, so the challenge is a little less formidable. Their classic \"Ruskie\" filling of potatoes, ricotta, bacon, and peas is a humble one, but it is nonetheless delightful.", "totalTime": "2 hours", "recipeYield": "makes 16 to 20 pierogi", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Bacon", "Cook the Book", "Legumes", "Mains", "Pork", "Potato"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Pierogi Dough</strong>", "3 cups (390 g) all-purpose flour, plus additional for kneading", "1 large egg", "2 teaspoons vegetable oil", "1 teaspoon salt, plus more for the boiling water", "1/2 to 3/4 cup (120 to 180 ml) warm water", "&nbsp", "<strong>Filling</strong>", "2 medium potatoes (white, baking, or Yukon gold\u2014whatever you prefer), peeled and cut into chunks", "6 strips bacon", "3 large onions, peeled\u20141 minced and 2 sliced", "1 cup (130 g) frozen baby peas, defrosted", "9 oz (255 g) ricotta cheese", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed", "1 to 2 cups/240 to 480 ml light sour cream (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the pierogi dough:</strong> On a clean work surface, mound the flour and make a well in the center.

Continue stirring with a wooden spoon, adding small amounts of the warm water, and gradually incorporating the flour. Only add the next bit of water when the last has been thoroughly blended with the flour and the mixture has become dry. Once the dough has begun to form, lose the spoon and knead the dough with your hands. Stop adding water once all the flour has been incorporated and a soft dough has formed (it should not feel wet or sticky\u2014if it does, add a little more flour).</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Grab a kitchen timer and set it for 8 minutes.
