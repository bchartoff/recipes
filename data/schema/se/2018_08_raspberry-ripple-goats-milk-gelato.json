Meanwhile, place a quart-sized container and flexible spatula in the freezer. When gelato looks fluffy and thick, shut off the machine and, using chilled spatula, scrape gelato into chilled container, drizzling a thick ribbon of raspberry syrup over each addition and reserving the rest to sauce the finished scoops. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface of the gelato and freeze until thick enough to scoop, about 4 hours.

For the most authentic presentation, soften gelato to 16&deg;F in the refrigerator before serving. In a squat container, like a yogurt tub or a square storage container, this will take about 45 minutes. However, the timing will vary substantially if a different container (such as a metal loaf pan or glass baking dish) is used, depending on the size, shape, and material of the container, so check on the gelato frequently to ensure it does not melt. Serve with additional syrup, if desired."}]}
