Remove the skin from the chicken, if desired. You can pull most of it off with your fingers; use a paring knife to cut the skin away from the wings and ends of the drumsticks.

If you don\u2019t have a mortar and pestle, you can make the spice paste in a food processor (a mini processor works better than a full-size processor, but you can use a full-size processor if you scrape down the side of the bowl often with a rubber spatula). Run the processor until the garlic and ginger are finely chopped, then gradually add the oil and puree to a smooth paste.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the tandoori paste into the neck and body cavities of the bird, spreading it around with the spatula.

Remove the chicken from the marinade, setting aside any remaining marinade. Hold the chicken upright, with the opening of the body cavity at the bottom, and position the bird on the can or chicken roaster so that it fits snugly into the cavity.

Use an instant-read meat thermometer to test for doneness, inserting it into the thickest part of a thigh but not so that it touches a bone. The internal temperature should be about 170\u00b0F.
