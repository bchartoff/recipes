Beef ribs are huge, fun to eat, and full of beefy flavor.  Many people choose to boil beef ribs before grilling in order to tenderize them, but this recipe rubs them with a savory coffee rub, then steams.  The thought is that the steaming allows the rub to continue to flavor the ribs, while still tenderizing them. Serve with plenty of grilled sweet corn and lots of beer.", "totalTime": "1 hour, plus overnight", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Beef", "Mains", "Sunday Supper"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoon instant coffee", "2 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar", "1 teaspoon chili powder", "1/2 teaspoon paprika", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon cracked black pepper", "6 pounds trimmed beef ribs, separated into individual ribs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine instant coffee, brown sugar,  chili powder, paprika, cumin, salt and black pepper, and mix well.
