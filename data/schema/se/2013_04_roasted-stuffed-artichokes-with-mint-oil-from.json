For the longest time, this vegetable seemed like too much work for too little food--there's peeling, scraping, poking, and snipping involved in most preparations. But in the last few years, I've come to appreciate the slow process as well as the slight grassy sweetness of the heart and the meditative undertaking of eating the flesh off the tiny leaves. <strong><a href=\"http://lucidfood.com/about-louisa/\">Louisa Shafia's</a></strong> stuffed artichokes recipe in <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Persian-Kitchen-Louisa-Shafia/dp/1607743574/?tag=serieats-20\">The New Persian Kitchen</a></em> adds another couple layers of greatness to the humble artichoke. To the center she adds a subtly fragrant and fluffy ricotta, egg, and saffron filling that puffs and browns over a long slow roasting time. Drizzled atop is a brilliant mixture of lemon juice, dried mint, and grape seed oil that permeates the delicate leaves a reduced sauce in the pan perfect for greedy dipping and slurping.", "totalTime": "about 2 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 2", "recipeCategory": ["Cheese", "Cook the Book", "Gluten-Free", "Lemon", "Mains", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "2 globe artichokes", "1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 tablespoon dried mint", "1/4 cup grapeseed oil", "1 clove garlic, finely minced", "Sea salt", "2 ounces ricotta cheese, drained", "Pinch of saffron, ground and steeped in 1 tablespoon hot water", "Grated zest of 1 lemon", "1 egg, whisked", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Fill a medium bowl three-quarters full with cold water.
