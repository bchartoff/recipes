As it gets thinner, you should be able to pull and stretch it gently with your hands to coax it into the shape you want.

Spread the bread crumb mixture evenly over the dough leaving a clean 1 1/2-inch-wide border on all sides of the rectangle.  Dot the breadcrumbs with small pieces of the remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Arrange the apple mixture in a long mound along the side closest to you.

Check the strudel: the top should be a light golden brown.  If deeper in color than that, reduce the temperature to 350\u00baF.  Rotate the baking pan in the oven so the strudel cooks evenly.  Continue baking until the strudel is deep golden brown and the crust is firm, about 30 minutes.  Remove the strudel from the oven and cool 30 minutes.
