In <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Home-Made-Winter-Yvette-Boven/dp/161769004X/?tag=serieats-20\">Home Made Winter</a></em>, <strong><a href=\"http://yvettevanboven.com/\">Yvette van Boven</a></strong> takes this breakfast staple and adds her own funky twists. Instead of simply adding the orange marmalade to the hot scones at the table, she incorporates the preserve into the dough as well as a bright glaze and creamy mascarpone-orange cream. The marmalade's bittersweet flavor is complemented by the richness of the butter and cream, and its floral character is amplified by a generous dose of ground cardamom throughout.", "totalTime": "1 hour", "recipeYield": "makes about 12 scones", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Breakfast Sweets", "Cook the Book"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Scones</strong>", "4 cups (500 g) self-rising flour ", "3 tablespoons superfine sugar ", "Pinch of salt ", "3 tablespoons (40 g) butter ", "1 cup (250 ml) milk ", "3 tablespoons (65 g) marmalade ", "1 tsp freshly ground cardamom seeds ", "\u00a0", "<strong>For the Glaze</strong>", "1/4 cup (85 g) marmalade ", "2 tablespoons water ", "1 teaspoon freshly ground cardamom seeds ", "Grated zest of 1 orange ", "\u00a0", "<strong>For the Mascarpone Cream</strong>", "1 tablespoon orange blossom water ", "1 tablespoon honey ", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon (250 g) mascarpone"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Make the scones:</strong> Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a bowl.
