But by eating lots of the real deal and getting mighty crafty with an array of unlikely ingredients, I managed to create a vegan carbonara that captures the essence of the original like no other: It's silky and rich, unctuous, and studded with meaty bits, with the sharp, lactic tang of Pecorino Romano (but, of course, no actual Pecorino Romano).", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Dairy-Free", "Italian", "Mains", "Mushrooms", "Other Vegetables", "Pasta", "Stovetop", "Tofu", "Vegan", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["7 ounces silken tofu (1/2 of a 14-ounce block; 200g)", "1/2 cup (120ml) sauerkraut brine (see note)", "1/4 cup nutritional yeast (1/2 ounce; 15g)", "1 tablespoon (15ml) white miso", "Generous pinch cayenne pepper or red chili flakes", "3 generous dashes (about 1/4 teaspoon) smoked paprika", "2 teaspoons (8g) freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon (15ml) white wine vinegar or fresh juice from 1 lemon", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided", "4 ounces (115g) king oyster mushrooms, stems and caps sliced into 1/2-inch \"lardons\"", "1 pound (450g) dry spaghetti or penne "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a blender, combine tofu, sauerkraut brine, nutritional yeast, miso, cayenne or chili flakes, smoked paprika, black pepper, and vinegar or lemon juice.
