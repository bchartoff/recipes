I disagree. I love having options in the kitchen and a roux is sometimes just the thickener--I can't imagine making gravy without it. The recipe below is just a guide. Use it when you want to make a silky white sauce or gravy. In fact, you probably already have recipes that call for roux; they just might not refer to it as a \"roux.\" Anytime you see fat and flour cooked together in a recipe, simply replace the wheat flour with sweet rice flour and follow the recipe as written.", "totalTime": "Five minutes for roux; ten minutes for white sauce", "recipeYield": "about 2 tablespoons of roux; 1 1/2 cups of white sauce", "recipeCategory": ["Gluten-Free", "Gluten-Free Tuesday"], "recipeIngredient": ["<b>For the Roux</b>", "1 ounce (two tablespoons) butter, olive oil, or other fat", "1 ounce (about two tablespoons) sweet rice flour", "<b> For the White Sauce</b>", "1 1/2 cups milk, room temperature", "salt and pepper to taste", "<i>optional</i> ", "1/2 small onion, diced and saut\u00e9ed until soft"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a small (2 quart) heavy-bottomed sauce pot, melt butter over medium-low heat.
