With only a pinch of baking soda to help them brown, these waffles are leavened primarily by steam, so they're light and crisp, with a hint of tangy goodness. Resist the temptation to crack in a whole egg, as the yolks will make the batter cakey and dense. With whites alone, the waffles are airy and crisp, with a delicate flavor that lets a hit of vanilla shine.", "totalTime": "20 minutes", "recipeYield": "Makes two 8-inch square waffles or three 7-inch Belgian waffles", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast Sweets", "Easter", "Father's Day", "Mother's Day", "Waffle"], "recipeIngredient": ["6 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (1 1/3 cup; 185g)", "1 1/2 ounces powdered sugar (1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons; 45g) ", "1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight", "1/2 teaspoon (3g) baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon (2g) baking powder", "1 vanilla bean, split and scraped (see note)", "14 ounces cultured lowfat buttermilk (1 3/4 cup; 395g) (see note)", "1 1/2 ounces unsalted butter, melted (3 tablespoons; 40g)", "2 large egg whites (about 2 1/2 ounces; 70g)", "1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract", "Maple syrup, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Batter:</strong> In a large bowl, combine flour, powdered sugar, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and the scrapings of one large vanilla bean, mixing by hand until the seeds are well dispersed.
