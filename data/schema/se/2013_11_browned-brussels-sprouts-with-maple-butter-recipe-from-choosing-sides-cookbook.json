Olive oil, salt, and a hot oven are my only requirements. While this method does produce pleasantly caramelized sprouts, it doesn't add much excitement to the table. This year, I'll take a cue from <strong><a href=\"http://taramdesmond.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tara Mataraza Desmond</a></strong> and toss my Brussels in brown butter and maple syrup as she does in her new cookbook, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Choosing-Sides-Holidays-Delicious-Recipes/dp/1449427111/?tag=serieats-20\">Choosing Sides</a></em>.", "totalTime": "30-25 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Brussels Sprouts", "Cook the Book", "Gluten-Free", "Sides", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 pounds Brussels sprouts, stem ends trimmed, outer leaves peeled, and halved (quartered if large)", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons pure maple syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.
