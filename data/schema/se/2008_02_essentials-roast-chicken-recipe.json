Close it well, but don\u2019t make it absolutely airtight or the chicken may burst. Run kitchen string from one leg to the other, tying it at both ends. Leave the legs in their natural position without pulling them tight.

Do not add any fat: it isn\u2019t necessary. Put the bird in the upper third of the preheated oven. After 30 minutes, turn the chicken so that it is on its back, breast facing up. Be careful not to puncture the skin while turning. Cook for another 30-35 minutes, then turn the oven up to 400\u00b0F and cook 20 minutes more. Calculate between 20 and 25 minutes\u2019 total cooking time for each pound of chicken.

The juices that run out are perfectly delicious; be sure to spoon them over the chicken slices.
