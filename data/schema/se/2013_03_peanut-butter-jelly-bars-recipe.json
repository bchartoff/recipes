For the smaller, deeper pan, you'll need to bake for at least an hour, turning every 20 minutes. Bars are fully baked when a skewer or paring knife inserted in center comes out with only a few crumbs, which should not be wet but will still be sticky. Allow to cool completely before removing. For faster removal and neater slicing, place in refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours or overnight. To slice shallow bars, lift out of pan by parchment overhang and place on cutting board. Cut with a clean chef's knife. For thicker bars, flip onto a cutting board, then invert and slice with a clean chef's knife.</p>"}]}
