Increase heat to high to maintain temperature. Fry, agitating constantly with chopsticks or a wire mesh spider until the tempura is a pale golden brown and very crisp, about 3 minutes. Transfer the fried vegetables to the paper-towel lined bowl, season with salt, and toss to drain excess oil. Transfer to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a 200\u00b0F oven to keep warm. Allow oil to reheat to 390\u00b0F and repeat with remaining batches. Serve immediately with ponzu mayonnaise.</p>"}]}
