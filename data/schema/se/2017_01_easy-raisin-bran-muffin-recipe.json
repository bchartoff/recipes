Don't be alarmed by the seemingly outrageous quantity of cinnamon: Its flavor is diluted to a gentle back note by the sheer volume of the muffin batter. I like to finish these muffins with a sprinkling of flax for crunch, but a sprinkling of bran flakes will crisp up nicely as well. Bran muffins bake best in a nonstick pan, which gives them a beautifully rounded dome (more on that <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2016/07/how-to-choose-the-best-muffin-pans-and-liners.html\">here</a>).", "totalTime": "35 minutes", "recipeYield": "makes 12 standard muffins", "recipeCategory": ["Baking", "Breakfast and Brunch", "Breakfast Sweets", "Easter", "Father's Day", "Mother's Day", "Quick and Easy", "Quick Bread"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces wheat bran, such as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bobs-Red-Mill-Wheat-Bran/dp/B000VDT6OW/?tag=serieats-20\">Bob\u2019s Red Mill</a> (1 cup; 55g)", "8 ounces boiling water (1 cup; 225g)", "4 ounces plain, non-fat Greek yogurt (1/2 cup; 115g)", "2 large eggs, cold", "6 1/2 ounces whole wheat flour (1 1/2 cups; 185g) ", "5 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (1 cup plus 1 tablespoon; 155g)", "5 1/4 ounces sugar (3/4 cup; 150g)", "1/2 ounce ground cinnamon (1 tablespoon; 15g)", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg", " 6 ounces unsalted butter, soft and creamy\u2014about 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C)(12 tablespoons; 170g)", "6 ounces golden raisins (1 cup; 170g), optional", "3/4 ounce flaxseed (3 tablespoons; 20g), optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350&deg;F (177&deg;C).
