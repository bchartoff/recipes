Form each piece into a circle, leaving about a half-inch overlap on either side. Where the two ends meet, press a finger to seal the ends and form an indent (it will make a nice resting place for the candied fruit later). Place the circles on an ungreased baking sheet.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Beat the egg white until frothy; gradually beat in the 2 tablespoons of sugar.
