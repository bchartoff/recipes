Want to make it even juicier and <em>more</em> foolproof? Cook the sucker sous vide. Because hams are precooked, it's really just a matter of reheating them. Typically, I'd suggest removing meat from its retail packaging, seasoning it, then resealing it in a sous vide bag before cooking it. But since ham's pre-seasoned, it can be cooked directly in the package it comes in, making the whole process even more appealing.</p>", "totalTime": "3 1/2 to 8 1/2 hours", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 12", "recipeCategory": ["Christmas", "Easter", "Ham", "Mains", "Pork", "Roasting", "Sous Vide", "Thanksgiving", "Winter"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 bone-in half ham (7 to 10 pounds; 3.2 to 4.5kg), packing intact (see note)", "1 cup (about 225g) brown sugar", "1 cup (240ml) balsamic vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat sous vide cooker to 140&deg;F (60&deg;C).
