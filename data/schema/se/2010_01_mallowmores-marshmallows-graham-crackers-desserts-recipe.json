Transfer the cookies to the prepared pans, spacing them 1 inch apart.  Gently gather together the extra dough and cut out as many cookies as possible.  Refrigerate with the oven preheats.  Position racks in the upper and lower third of the oven.  Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.  While the oven preheats, make sure that the marshmallows are ready to use.  If they have been coated with cornstarch, shake them gently to remove any excess.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Bake the grahams for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the cookies are dry to the touch but still have a tiny bit of spring to them.  Do not bake until crisp.  Their color will barely change.  Place the pans on racks and immediately, while the cookies are still warm, place a marshmallow on top of each.  The heat of the cookie will seal the marshmallow to the cookie, which is very important for the following chocolate dipping step.  Cool completely on the pans set on racks.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in the microwave.

Place cookie side down back on the pan and repeat with the remaining cookies.  Refrigerate briefly to set the chocolate.  Store at room temperature for up to 3 days in an airtight container in single layers separated by parchment paper.  Alternatively, they may be refrigerated for up to 1 week.
