Remove the dough from the mixer bowl, place it on a tray, and cover it loosely with plastic wrap. This dough block is called the d\u00e9trempe. Place the tray in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or for up to 12 hours.

Scrape the butter out of the bowl directly onto the 6-inch-square lump in the center of the dough, and pat it with your fingers into a square that covers the 6-inch-square lump.

Tug at the flaps to keep them in a square that covers the butter. You will now have a butter square that is entirely encased in dough above and below.

Then lift the left side of the dough and fold it in, so the left edge also meets the scored line in the center and meets the right edge, as well. Square off the folds as much as possible so the edges meet neatly, then fold the right half of the dough on top of the left half. This is called a book fold. Your dough will now be 4 inches wide, 10 inches from top to bottom, and about 2 inches thick. Rotate the dough pile clockwise 90 degrees; it will now be 10 inches wide and 4 inches from top to bottom.
