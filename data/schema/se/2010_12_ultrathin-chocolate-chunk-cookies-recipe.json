These wafer-like <strong>Ultrathin Chocolate Chunk Cookies</strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.alicemedrich.com/\">Alice Medrich</a></strong>'s <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Crispy-Crunchy-Your-Mouth-Cookies-Medrich/dp/1579653979/serieats-20\">Chewy Gooey Crispy Crunchy Melt-in-Your-Mouth Cookies</a></em></strong> fall solidly into crispy and chewy territory.   The chew comes from the addition of rolled oats and the crispness from a dough that spreads super thin (and super fast) during baking.

Cool the cookies completely before stacking or storing.  May be kept in an airtight container for at least 3 days.</p>"}]}
