Add butter/milk/yogurt mixture to flour mixture and stir to form a very dry and shaggy dough.

Meanwhile, prepare the frosting by combining mascarpone, cream, sugar, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip on medium speed until sugar is dissolved and frosting is fluffy, thick, and capable of holding medium-soft peaks. If necessary, season with additional salt and/or vanilla to taste.

Meanwhile, let buns stand at room temperature until oven is hot. When oven is hot, bake, covered, until buns are puffed and firm but pale, about 30 minutes. (If using darker pans, check on the buns a little sooner.) Remove foil and continue baking until buns are lightly browned, about 15 minutes more. Snip a corner from the bag of frosting and squeeze over each bun; alternatively, spoon frosting over the buns. Serve immediately, as the buns do not hold up well over time.</p>"}]}
