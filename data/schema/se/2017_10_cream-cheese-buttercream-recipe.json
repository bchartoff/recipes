Add pudding a few tablespoons at a time, then drizzle in the lemon juice; if you like, season to taste with a pinch of salt (see note). Scrape the bowl once more and whip a few seconds to ensure no lumps remain. The buttercream should be light and creamy, but thick enough to hang upside down from a spoon.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Use buttercream immediately, or transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out the air, and seal.
