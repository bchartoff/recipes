I'm happy to eat a plate of vegan food&mdash;rice, beans, and vegetables are some of my favorite things to eat. Once \"meat\" and \"cheese\" get involved, meals tend to get a little weird.

(If you\u2019re using canned beans, rinse them before draining.) <br />\r\nUse tempeh instead of tofu. It will be tangier and slightly more dense, closer to the texture of ground meat. <br />\r\nSmall whole wheat tortillas are good, here, too. Soften them the same way as described above.</p>"}]}
