Jiggle the bowl, moving it in a flat, circular motion, like the motion of a hula hoop, until the rice forms into a ball on its own\u2014a neat kitchen trick Tadashi\u2019s mom taught him. This motion packs the rice so it holds together when it grills.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Wet your hands and place the ball of rice between your cupped palms. Now squeeze, flip, and turn the rice ball several times to form it into a triangular shape. This motion takes a little practice, but after a few yaki onigiri, you\u2019ll get the hang of it. Make sure not to compact the rice too tight; you want it to just stick together.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat a grill to medium. Grill the onigiri for about 6 minutes, flipping once. Brush the onigiri with the soy sauce. Grill for about 2 minutes more, flipping every 30 seconds, and brushing on more soy sauce after each turn. Grill the edges of the onigiri triangle, too, about 20 seconds per edge. The onigiri will have a crispy, caramelized crust when they\u2019re done. Serve immediately.<br />\n</p>"}]}
