First off is the potato cooking method. Instead of aggressively boiling, Ruhlman opts for a gentle simmer on medium-low heat; this way the exterior doesn't disintegrate into the cooking water. The potatoes are then drained and left aside for their steam to release, therefore drying out the potatoes slightly and making for a fluffier mash. The final element added to this amazing mash&mdash;and the one that sets it apart&mdash;is brown butter, with all its caramelly, nutty flavor. Incorporating brown butter into mashed potatoes gives them an added element of richness in a way that is both nearly effortless but totally elegant. This is of those recipes that will certainly change the way you think about humble mashed potatoes from here on out.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Mashed Potatoes", "Sides", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound russet/baking or Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into large pieces", "1 cup milk, plus more if needed", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup butter\u00a0 "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and add water to cover.
