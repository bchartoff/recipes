And if you use your imagination it's not a far leap to think of a cleaned squid body as the ocean's sausage casing.  Squid are creatures that need to be cooked hot and quick, or low and slow to get the best results, so once you add the squid to the tomato sauce, make sure to give it the time it needs.  The best test of when the squid is done cooking is taking it out of the pan and giving it a try.  To me, fork-poking a slow cooked squid doesn't give an accurate portrayal of its state.", "totalTime": "1 hour", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Mains", "Other Seafood", "Pork", "Sunday Supper"], "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 pound sausage (hot is ideal)", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs", "1/4 cup chopped parsley", "12 squid, cleaned with tentacles removed but reserved", "drizzle olive oil", "2 cloves garlic sliced", "1 onion, finely chopped", "1 X 28 ounce can whole peeled plum tomatoes", "2 tablespoons parsley", "1 pound pasta, or loaf of crusty bread to serve", "lemon slices, to garnish", "sliced scallions to garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine sausage, breadcrumbs and chopped parsley until well combined.
