Instead of just mixing mayonnaise with tuna, you create a dynamic black olive pesto, which is spread on the bread right before it's grilled. The tuna is then spiked with capers, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes. It has flavor to spare. But the final trick that sends this sandwich over the edge is the panini press. Grilling the sandwich unifies it into one glorious, crispy package.", "totalTime": "20 minutes", "recipeYield": "3 people", "recipeCategory": ["Dinner Tonight", "Olives", "Pesto", "Sandwiches"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Pesto</strong>", "1 cup black olives, pitted", "10 caper berries, any stems removed", "Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon ", "1 cup olive oil ", "<strong>For the Sandwiches:</strong>", "One 6-ounce can tuna in olive oil, drained", "6 caper berries, stems discarded, chopped", "2 tablespoons olive oil ", "1 teaspoon red wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, from about \u00bd lemon", "Pinch crushed red pepper flakes", "3 ciabatta rolls, split in half "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>For the Pesto: Toss all ingredients into a blender or food processor.
