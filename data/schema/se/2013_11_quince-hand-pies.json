Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until quince is cooked through and mixture is caramelized, about one hour. Remove from heat and add more spices to taste, if you like.

Pies are done when quince bubbles from cut vents and crust is golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before serving.</p>"}]}
