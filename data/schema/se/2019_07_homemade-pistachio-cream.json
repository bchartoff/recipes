Rather than traditional mixing methods that use a whisk or stand mixer to aerate the cream, this recipe relies on an immersion blender or food processor to limit aeration. This makes for an especially creamy, thick, and stable whipped cream that can be held for up to a week in the fridge. It's the perfect topping for ice cream sundaes, fresh fruit tarts, pancakes, and French toast, or try it dolloped over a slice of <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/07/pistachio-cake.html\">pistachio cake</a>!", "totalTime": "5 minutes", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Desserts", "Gluten-Free", "No-Cook", "Nuts"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 1/2 ounces <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/07/homemade-pistachio-paste.html\">Homemade Pistachio Paste</a> (about 1/2 cup; 127g), chilled to about 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C)", "12 ounces heavy cream (about 1 1/2 cups; 340g)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the pistachio paste and cream into a measuring cup, blending container, or jar just large enough to accommodate the head of an immersion blender.
