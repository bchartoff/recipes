Put the chicken skin-side down on the grate, laying it flat. Let cook for 5 minutes or so before you move it.

Because you have a whole butterflied chicken, most of the time on the grill will be spent skin-side down. Nonetheless, plan on generally worrying the chicken for 30 to 40 minutes.

(You can also douse the flames with a squirt bottle if there\u2019s no room to move the chicken out of the way.) The meat should be firm but with a little give when you poke it with your finger. Look for a reading of 175\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh. If you\u2019re unsure, cut into a thigh and take a peek. Clear juices running from the spot where you pierce the meat and just beyond pink but opaque flesh through to the joint is what you want.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Transfer the cooked chicken from the grill to a cutting board.
