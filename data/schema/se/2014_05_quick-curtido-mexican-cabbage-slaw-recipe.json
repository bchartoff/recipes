This funky, vinegary cabbage, onion and carrot slaw brings crunch and a hit of acid to a host of rich, long-cooked dishes that call out for brightness and texture. Traditional curtido is prepared days in advance of when it'll be eaten, enabling it to develop a fermented tang, but this shortcut version&mdash;ready in only an hour&mdash;is a nice fallback when you don't have time to think ahead.
