Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble the ravioli.) Scoop up 1/3 cup of the ricotta filling and form it into a disk about 1/2 inch high and 2 1/4 inches in diameter.

Roll the dough out to the third thinnest setting on a pasta sheeter (number 6 using a KitchenAid attachment), stacking the sheets of dough on one of the parchment-lined baking sheets. When you have rolled out all of the dough, dust a flat work surface with flour and lay one sheet of the\u00a0dough on the floured surface. Place three or four ricotta disks on the dough, leaving 4 inches between each disk and 1 1/2 to 2 inches of dough on all the sides of the outer disks. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to make a crater deep enough to hold an egg yolk in the center of each disk. Separate one egg, reserving the white and carefully sliding the yolk into one crater.

Continue making cuts down the sheet of dough between the disks. Using a pastry brush, brush egg white around each cheese disk. Lift one segment of dough from the back sheet and lay it on top of the corresponding front segment of dough. Without lifting the raviolo, cup both hands around the cheese so that the edges of your pinky fingers press down around the cheese, sealing the raviolo closed. Repeat, covering and sealing the remaining ravioli. Use a 3 \u00d7 3 inch fluted cookie cutter or fluted pastry wheel to cut each raviolo, discarding the scraps of dough around it.
