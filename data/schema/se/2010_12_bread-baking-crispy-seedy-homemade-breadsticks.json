Stir to combine, and set aside until it is bubbly, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining flour and the instant potatoes, and knead with the dough hook until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add the salt, oil, and seeds, and continue kneading until the seeds are well distributed. Form the dough into a ball and drizzle with a bit of olive oil.

Roll it to approximately 11 x 20 inches. With a pastry cutter or pizza cutter (or a knife, but a rolling cutter is easier) trim the edges so they're straight. You'll use those scraps as well. After trimming, my rectangle of dough was about 9 x 18 inches. Cut the dough into 9-inch long strips, about the thickness of a pencil, and place them on baking sheets, leaving a little room between each so they can expand a little during baking. You will need about 3 baking sheets to fit them all. You can twist the breadsticks, or leave them straight. When you're done with all of the uniformly-shaped breadsticks, cut the scraps as well, combining smaller pieces if needed.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Bake at 275 degrees for one hour, rotating the pans and moving them to different racks as needed for even cooking. After an hour, they should be dry and crisp; a sample should snap in half and be completely dry in the center. If they haven't browned to your liking, raise the heat to 325 and bake for another 4-7 minutes, watching carefully to make sure they don't over-brown.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Let the breadsticks cool completely on racks, then leave them out for several hours or overnight before you store them in any sort of closed container&mdash;any residual moisture can make them soft.
