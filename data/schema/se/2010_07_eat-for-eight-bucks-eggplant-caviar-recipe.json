With good bread and a <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2008/02/essentials-jacques-pepin-vinaigrette-recipe.html\">thoughtfully dressed</a> green salad, the combination becomes a real meal (and a downright luxurious one, if you ask me).", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCategory": ["Eat for Eight Bucks", "Eggplant"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium eggplant (about 1 pound)", "Olive oil", "Salt", "Pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.
