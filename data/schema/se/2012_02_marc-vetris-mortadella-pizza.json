If baking less frequently, store it in the refrigerator and feed every other week. To feed the starter, scoop out 2 cups (bake with it, give it away, or trash it) and replace it with 2 cups high-protein flour and 2 cups warm water (100 to 110\u00baF), stirring until blended. Most of the bread recipes in this book call for 1 to 2 cups of starter, so you can use that amount to bake with, then replace it with a 50-50 mix of flour and water.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Napoletana Pizza Dough:</strong> Put the flour, starter, and water in the bowl of a stand mixer.

It\u2019s easier to start stretching pizza dough in the air instead of on a work surface, because in the air gravity will pull down the dough, stretching it from where it\u2019s held in your fingers. Once it\u2019s stretched to about 8 inches in diameter, put the dough on the counter and pat it out with your fingertips from the center toward the edge to fully stretch the round of dough. Gently push your palms into the center of the dough to gently stretch it away toward to the edges. Pat and stretch to a round about 12 inches in diameter and a little more than a 1/4 inch thick, with a thicker rim.
