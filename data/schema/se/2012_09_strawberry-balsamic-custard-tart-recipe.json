The crust, a crumbly chocolate sable, is filled with vanilla pastry cream, and topped with fresh sliced strawberries and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. While vinegar as a dessert condiment may seem a little unorthodox, the slightly sweet, slightly savory acidity compliments the sweetness of the strawberries and the pastry cream. It's just the thing when you're in the mood for something a little less traditional.", "totalTime": "6 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 8", "recipeCategory": ["Desserts", "Fruit Desserts", "Pies, Tarts, and Crumbles", "Strawberry"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups (about 7 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup confectioners' sugar", "1/2 cup cocoa powder", "Pinch salt", "9 tablespoons (1 stick plus 1 tablespoon) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pices ", "1 large egg yolk", "1 recipe <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/08/pastry-cream-recipe-for-cakes-eclairs-pastries.html?ref=search\">Vanilla Pastry Cream</a>, chilled", "1 quart strawberries, hulled and sliced", "3 to 4 tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In bowl of food processor, pulse flour, confectioners' sugar, cocoa, and salt until combined, about 3 one-second pulses.
