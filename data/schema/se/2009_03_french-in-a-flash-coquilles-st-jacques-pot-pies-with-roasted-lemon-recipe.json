Add in the shallots, garlic, and mushrooms, and season with only pepper--not salt just yet.  Adding salt now would cause the mushrooms to weep their moisture (wouldn't you, if you were salted and in a hot pot?), and if they weep, they won't caramelize and maximize their flavor. Cook the vegetables on medium-high heat for about 5-7 minutes, until the mushrooms really start to sear and caramelize. Then, season them with salt.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to the pot, and then the 3 tablespoons flour.

Add in the wine and clam juice next, and finally the half and half.  Whisk like you mean it. Season again with salt, and a good bit of black pepper. Cook over medium heat until the sauce thickens. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way to tell if a b\u00e9chamel sauce has thickened is to dip a wooden spoon into the sauce. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If you leave a distinct stripe, the sauce is thickened. If the sauce just pours back over the spot you touched, it is still too loose. If you find that your sauce never seems to want to achieve its maximum b\u00e9chamel potential, make a <em>beurre mani\u00e9</em>, or \"handled butter,\" by combining 1/2 tablespoon butter with one tablespoon flour with a fork. Stir it into the sauce, and that should help it thicken up.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Meanwhile, grease 4 <a href=\"http://www.crateandbarrel.com/family.aspx?c=550&f=7387&q=gratin&fromLocation=Search&DIMID=400001&SearchPage=1\">individual gratin dishes</a>.
