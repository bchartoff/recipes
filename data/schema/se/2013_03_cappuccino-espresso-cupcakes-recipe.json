Beat in vanilla. In a separate bowl, whisk or sift together flour, baking powder and salt, then add to batter alternately with milk mixture, beginning and ending with dry mixture. Scrape bowl thoroughly between additions. Don't panic if batter looks curdled, it will bake up fine. Line muffin tins with cupcake papers and fill each one 2/3 full. Bake for 15 minutes, then turn and bake another 5. A cake tester or paring knife inserted should come out clean. Be careful not to overbake as these cupcakes easily dry out.

While egg whites are heating, whisk milk powder into remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Once egg whites mixture is ready, remove and whip with electric handheld mixer or whip attachment on stand mixer on second highest speed.
