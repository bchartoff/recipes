Add the eggs one at a time and beat will after each addition. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and the beater and beat on high speed to ensure that the mixture is fully mixed. Stop the mixer, add the cocoa water and half the milk, plus half the dry ingredients. Mix on low until incorporated. Scrape down the mixer, then add the rest of the milk and dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly on low speed, scraping down one more time. Finish mixing with a big rubber spatula by hand, taking care not to overmix.

Bring the cream and salt to a boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate and allow it to sit for one minute, then whisk until completely smooth (if you have a hand blender, this makes the process go faster). Chill the ganache uncovered in the fridge for two hours, stirring every twenty minutes. Once the ganache feels cold but is still liquid, remove it from the fridge and attach the bowl to the mixer. Whip using the whisk attachment, slowly at first, gradually increasing speed to high. You will notice the mixture will thicken after about a minute, watch it closely. It will begin to hold soft peaks. Watch for it to get just slightly firmer, and don\u2019t allow it to go any further. Ice the cake with the whipped ganache immediately after making, as it will begin to seize up if left to sit. Refrigerate cake until you are ready to serve, up to one day, allow it to come to room temperature before serving. Sprinkle with sea salt before serving if desired.</p>"}]}
