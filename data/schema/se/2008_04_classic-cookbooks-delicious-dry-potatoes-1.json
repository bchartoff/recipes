When very hot, put in the fennel and cumin seeds, and then the mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds. As they begin to change color and pop (about 10 seconds), add the red peppers. As soon as the red peppers swell and darken, add the diced potatoes, turmeric, and salt. Keep on medium heat and fry, turning gently so as not to break the potatoes. Fry for 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are unevenly browned. Squeeze lemon juice over potatoes and taste for salt.</p>"}]}
