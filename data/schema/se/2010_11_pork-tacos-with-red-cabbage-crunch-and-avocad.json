Since a taco's filling is infinitely variable, the choice lies in your hands to make them cheap or expensive. You could buy fresh fish, for example, but that would up the price a bit. You could also consider a wide range of potential garnishes, everything from salsa to shredded cheese to cilantro to black beans. On the other hand, if you're looking to save money, the trick is to minimize. Use a filling that's hearty but cheap, and practice rigid discipline with respect to your garnishes.", "totalTime": "16 hours", "recipeYield": "2", "recipeCategory": ["Avocado", "Eat for Eight Bucks", "Mexican", "Pork", "Slow Cooker"], "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons packed brown sugar", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1/3 cup cider vinegar", "Kosher salt", "1 pound pork butt", "1 carrot", "2 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 medium onion, quartered", "3 tablespoons bottled or homemade barbecue sauce", "1 chipotle pepper from a can of chipotles in adobo sauce, minced, plus extra sauce", "1/4 medium red cabbage, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 tablespoon juice from 1 lime", "1 teaspoon white wine vinegar (or use more cider vinegar)", "2 teaspoons vegetable or canola oil", "4 flour tortillas", "1 avocado, cubed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Mix together brown sugar, ground coriander, vinegar and 1 \u00bd tablespoons salt in bowl large enough to fit pork.
