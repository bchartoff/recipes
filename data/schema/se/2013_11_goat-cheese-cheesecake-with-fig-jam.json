Mix butter into dry ingredients with fingertips, then press evenly in bottoms of pans. Bake for 5 minutes, then turn and bake another 2-3 minutes, until almond flour is toasted.

In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment or in medium mixing bowl with handheld electric mixer, cream together cream cheese, goat cheese and sugar. Do not turn mixer past the first two speeds as you do not want to incorporate excess air. Scrape bowl often.
