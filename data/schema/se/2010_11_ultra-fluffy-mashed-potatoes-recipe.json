We accomplish this by peeling and dicing them before rinsing them in water and boiling them just until cooked. After cooking, they get a final rinse before heading to the ricer. Using a ricer or food mill prevents excess damage to the starch granules, helping the potatoes remain nice and light.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 12", "recipeCategory": ["Christmas", "Gluten-Free", "Mashed Potatoes", "Sides", "Stovetop", "Thanksgiving", "The Food Lab", "Vegetarian", "Winter"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds (1.8kg) russet potatoes", "2 cups (475ml) whole milk", "12 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks; 6 ounces; 170g), room temperature, cut into 1/2-inch pats", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Peel potatoes and cut into rough chunks, about 1 to 2 inches cubed.
