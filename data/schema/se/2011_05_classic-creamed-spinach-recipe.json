Slater begins his creamed spinach by infusing milk with black peppercorns, bay leaf, and an onion. The milk is simmered and added to a mix of butter and flour, then whisked into a very thick, creamy roux. Spinach, cream, and nutmeg are incorporated at the very last minute, resulting in the kind of creamed spinach that you'd order at a steakhouse that's been around for longer than you have.", "totalTime": "20 minutes", "recipeYield": "makes 4 servings", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Sides", "Spinach", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups (300ml) milk ", "A small onion, peeled", "A bay leaf", "6 black peppercorns", "2 pounds (1kg) spinach  ", "4 tablespoons (50g) butter ", "6 tablespoons (50g) all-purpose flour ", "4 tablespoons heavy cream ", "Nutmeg\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Put the milk in a saucepan with the onion, bay leaf, and black peppercorns.
