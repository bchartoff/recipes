Because they're so thin, they cook the fastest and are easy to break when you attempt to turn or lift the steaks. By evening out the shape of the steaks into rounds, as we do here, the fish cooks more evenly, and broken belly flaps are pretty much a non-issue. Plus they're boneless, which makes eating them that much easier.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Easter", "Father's Day", "Mains", "Salmon"], "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "4 (8-ounce; 225g) salmon steaks, <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/07/how-to-grill-salmon-steaks.html\">deboned and rolled into medallions</a>", "1 recipe <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/03/teriyaki-sauce-how-to-make-at-home-recipe.html\">Homemade Teriyaki Sauce</a>", "Thinly sliced scallions, for garnish", "Lemon wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Fill a medium bowl with water and add kosher salt until it tastes like ocean water.
