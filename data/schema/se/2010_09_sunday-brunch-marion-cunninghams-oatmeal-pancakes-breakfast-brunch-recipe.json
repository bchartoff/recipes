Add a 1/2 teaspoon of butter and spread across surface with paper towel (there should be no visible butter). Drop batter onto griddle by scant quarter cups. When bubbles form on raw surface of pancakes and begin to burst (this may take 90 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on the thickness/size of your griddle and burner), use thin spatula to check that underside is lightly browned and flip. Cook until second side is lightly browned and pancakes are cooked through, about 90 seconds longer. Serve immediately, unadorned or accompanied by maple syrup or warm applesauce if desired.</p>"}]}
