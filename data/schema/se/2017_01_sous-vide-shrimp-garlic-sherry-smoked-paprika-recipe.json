With a sous vide cooker, you don't have this issue because that short window of time between perfect and overcooked stretches out to a good half hour or so. Sous vide also allows you to achieve textures that you can't really get through more traditional methods and affords you the opportunity to infuse the shrimp with flavor while they cook, like this version flavored Spanish-style with extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, smoked paprika, and sherry.", "totalTime": "35 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Mains", "Shrimp", "Sous Vide", "Spanish", "The Food Lab"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds large peeled shrimp (about 700g) (see note)", "Kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil", "6 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon sweet smoked Spanish paprika (about 6g)", "2 bay leaves", "3 tablespoons (45ml) sherry", "1 1/2 teaspoons (6ml) sherry vinegar", "2 tablespoons (30g) butter", "Crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Set your sous vide water bath to desired temperature according to the chart above.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a large bowl, toss shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and the baking soda.
