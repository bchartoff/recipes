Pick out any visible strands of white gristle. Gently form 4 patties, neither pressing nor squeezing the meat. Air is good. You should have about 1/3-pound burgers, which suits the no-holds-harred spirit of this meal. Very thick patties are more difficult to cook; make them thinner;1 1/2 inches is about right;and cook them fast and hot. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Before you cook your burgers, make sure the bacon is done to a crisp and that you have a tomato sliced, lettuce washed, and Kaiser rolls toasting. Butter each roll while it's hot. When everything is ready, cook the burgers either on a grill or in a cast-iron pan. Whichever method you choose, don't press the burgers down with your spatula as you cook! And don't forget to put the cheese on for the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking on the second side. This should give it time to melt. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To grill,</strong> your coals should be so hot that you can comfortably keep your hand 2 inches above the grate for 3 seconds;just! (For gas grills, this means 450\u00b0F.) Make sure the grill is well oiled. Put the burgers on the hottest part of the grill and sear for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. If they're browning too much, move them to a cooler pan of the grill to finish cooking. <strong>To pan-fry,</strong> heat the peanut oil in a heavy pan until it's very hot;almost smoking. Sear the burgers for 3 minutes on each side over high heat before turning down the burner. Finish cooking over moderate heat, flipping the burgers every few minutes as they cook. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Test for doneness often by poking, or use an instant-read thermometer. Take them off at between 125\u00b0 and 130\u00b0F for rare to medium-rare.
