(If you like, some dough can be frozen for up to 3 months in heavy-duty zip-top bags, then brought to room temperature for baking.) Arrange portioned dough on a parchment-lined aluminum half-sheet pan, shaping each piece into a craggy, cookie-shaped blob. If you like, top cookies with a few extra candy pieces. Bake until puffed and firm around the edges, though steamy and soft in the middle, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature directly on sheet pan; cookies will be extraordinarily fragile while warm. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days."}]}
