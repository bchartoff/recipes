But the real secret is refined coconut oil, which is odorless at high heat and happens to be the tastiest fry oil around.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "Makes about 36 mini doughnuts", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast Sweets", "Cakes", "Deep Frying", "Desserts", "Doughnuts", "Father's Day", "Mother's Day"], "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 ounces granulated sugar (1/2 cup; 100g)", "1 teaspoon (4g) baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon (3g) baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight", "1 ounce unsalted butter (2 tablespoons; 30g), melted", "1/4 ounce vanilla extract (1 1/2 teaspoons; 7ml)", "3 large egg yolks, preferably free-range for color", "4 ounces plain, unsweetened nonfat Greek yogurt (1/2 cup; 110g), room temperature", "6 1/2 ounces low-protein, all-purpose flour (shy 1 1/4 cup; 185g), such as Gold Medal, plus more for dusting", "Refined coconut oil, enough to reach a 2\u201d depth; about 32 ounces (1L) in an 8\u201d pot", "4 ounces powdered sugar (1 cup; 115g)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Making and Shaping the Dough:</strong> Combine granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl, then stir in melted butter, vanilla, egg yolks, and Greek yogurt. When well combined, sift in flour and stir to form a soft dough, no more than 30 seconds. Turn onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until easy to handle. Dusting with as much flour as needed, roll to 3/8 inch thick. Brush off excess flour with a damp pastry brush and cut into 1 3/4&ndash;inch rounds. Arrange upside down on a paper towel&ndash;lined baking sheet, then brush away excess flour. Gather scraps, briefly knead, and repeat as before.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Forming the Hole:</strong> With a damp fingertip, press an indentation into the center of each doughnut, then flip the doughnuts and repeat. Take one doughnut in both hands and use a finger to gently pull open a hole in the center. (The paper-thin centers will give way at the slightest touch.) Smooth the ragged edges if you like and repeat with the remaining doughnuts.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Preparing the Oil:</strong> Melt refined coconut oil in a microwave, then pour into a roughly 8- to 10-inch stainless steel pot to a depth of at least 2 inches. (This gives cake doughnuts room to sink, allowing them to fry more quickly and absorb less oil.) Clip on digital thermometer and warm to 365&deg;F over medium heat. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with 3 layers of paper towels and have the powdered sugar ready in a fine-mesh sieve.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Frying the Doughnuts:</strong> When oil reaches 365&deg;F, practice maintaining that temperature for a few minutes before beginning to fry. Once you're comfortable with the controls, slip a test doughnut into the hot oil and fry until pale gold, turning frequently with tongs to ensure even color, about 60 seconds. Transfer to a paper towel&ndash;lined baking sheet, then sprinkle generously with powdered sugar. Taste to see how you like the results, adding or subtracting a few seconds if needed to perfect subsequent batches. Fry remaining doughnuts, up to 6 or 7 at a time, and enjoy warm with powdered sugar. Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 36 hours at room temperature (these are best dunked in milk or coffee).</p>"}]}
