Lay the rolled towel in a ring on your work surface and set the bowl in the center of the ring. Combine the grapeseed oil and olive oil and add the oil a few drops at a time, whisking constantly to form an emulsion. When you've added about half of the oil begin to drizzle the oil in a slow steady stream, continuing to whisk constantly, until all of the oil has been added. Taste for seasoning and add more salt, if desired. The garlic mayonnaise can be made up to three days in advance; transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate until you are ready to use it.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To prepare the peppers, adjust the oven racks so one is in the middle position and preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.
