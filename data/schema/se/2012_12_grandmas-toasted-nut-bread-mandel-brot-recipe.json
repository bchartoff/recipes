Add the eggs, one at a time, and the vanilla, salt, and orange juice. Sift together the flower and baking powder, then add to the wet mixture until a dough forms. Take some dough and roll it in four. Make rolls about 2 1/2 round, and grease a cookie sheet. Lay about 4 or 5 of these rolls about 2 inches apart. Bake at 350&deg;F for 25 minutes, or until brown. Slice each roll at an angle, turn on their sidse, and continue to bake until browned on each side (about 15 more minutes). You can make half the recipe easily.</p>"}]}
