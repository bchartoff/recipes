Our version uses a buttermilk brine for extra juiciness and flavor. We take the leftovers and pack them into a full-sized loaf of toasted ciabatta, adding some extra sauce and cheese to keep the bread moist before cutting it up into single serving slices. This is a chicken Parm sandwich so good it's almost worth making the chicken Parm fresh just for the sandwich.", "totalTime": "15 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCategory": ["Chicken", "Mains", "Sandwiches"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 loaf ciabatta, split in half lengthwise", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/09/the-best-slow-cooked-italian-american-tomato-sauce-red-sauce-recipe.html\">red sauce</a> (see note)", "1 batch <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/09/the-food-lab-chicken-parm-chicken-parmesan-parmigiana-italian-american.html\">chicken Parmesan</a>, fully cooked", "4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Adjust broiler rack to 8 inches below the heat source and preheat broiler to high. Place ciabatta cut-side-up on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Place under broiler and cook until well browned and crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer top bun to a large cutting board. Spread bottom bun with extra sauce and top with chicken cutlets, shingling them so they all fit in a single layer covering the bread (cutlets should already have sauce and some cheese on them). Top with more cheese. Return to broiler and cook until cheese is fully melted and starting to bubble and brown. Remove from oven and immediately close sandwich, pressing down firmly to seal. Let rest for 1 minute. Slice into 6 to 8 single-serving pieces and serve.</p>"}]}
