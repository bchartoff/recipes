Increase to medium-high (8 on a KitchenAid) and continue whipping until the meringue is glossy white and thick enough that you can see the pattern left by the wire whisk; this can take between 2 and 4 minutes, depending on the freshness of the whites and the horsepower of your mixer. When meringue is ready, it should be soft enough to flow off the wires when the whisk attachment is removed, but thick enough to mound up on itself like soft-serve in the bowl.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Sprinkle cake flour on top and stir with a flexible spatula to roughly combine.

Slide an offset spatula around the sides of cake to loosen, remove the insert, and slide spatula under the bottom as well. Flip onto a serving plate, pulling gently on the sides of the cake to release it from the center tube. To serve, cut with a chef's knife, using a gentle sawing motion and only the slightest downward pressure. If you like, serve with your favorite chocolate sauce or <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/09/easy-caramel-sauce-recipe.html\">homemade caramel</a>.
