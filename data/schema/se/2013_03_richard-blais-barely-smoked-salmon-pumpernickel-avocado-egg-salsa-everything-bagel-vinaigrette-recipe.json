The anchor is a small fillet of salmon, smoked for only five minutes. This leaves the fish almost raw with a faint whiff of smoke. The bagel appears crumbled and crunchy in a \"salsa\" like assemblage with avocado and peeled cherry tomatoes. Capers, red onion, and egg also show up, along with the \"everything bagel\" seeds and spices present in the vinaigrette. It makes for a beautiful plate, unfamiliar in appearance, but comforting in flavor.", "totalTime": "40 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Avocado", "Bread", "Breakfast and Brunch", "Cook the Book", "Salmon"], "recipeIngredient": ["Cooking spray", "1/2 cup hickory chips", "Four 4-ounce center-cut skin-on wild salmon fillets", "2 cups cubed or roughly torn (1/2-inch pieces) pumpernickel bagel, pumpernickel bread, lightly toasted, or toasted pumpernickel croutons", "1/2 small red onion, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon capers, drained", "1 ripe avocado, halved and pitted", "8 cherry tomatoes, peeled", "1 large hard-boiled egg, white and yolk separated", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "<a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/03/richard-blaiss-everything-bagel-vinaigrette.html\">\"Everything Bagel\" Vinaigrette</a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Spray the rack of a stovetop smoker with cooking spray and set the salmon on it.
