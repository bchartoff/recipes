Add the capers, olives, vinegar, raisins, mint leaves, and pine nuts. Cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Taste and season with salt, if needed, and grind in pepper. If the pan seems in danger of drying, add up to 1/2 cup of water. Return the fish to the pan, cover, and cook gently to partly meld the flavors, not much more than 5 minutes.\u00a0</p>"}]}
