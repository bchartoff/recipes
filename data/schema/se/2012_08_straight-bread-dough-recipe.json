Because this dough has a relatively low hydration, I recommend using the convention kneading technique, although you may need to use the French method a few times just to get the dough into a more workable consistency. Knead until the gluten has fully developed and the dough can pass the window test. Note: The whole wheat dough recipe will never pass the window test because the hulls in the flour cut the gluten strands, just make sure that the dough is nice and elastic before moving on to the next step. This may take from 10 to 15 minutes of kneading depending on how fast and deliberate you are. (One side effect of kneading is that you get a workout in, too!)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Bulk ferment the dough according to the instructions in \u201cBulk Fermentation\u201d portion of section 2.

Fold again and ferment for another 15 minutes. Note: For the whole wheat dough, use the second folding technique.
