Little chunks of marinated meat threaded onto bamboo skewers, grilled over coals until charred, then served with a sweet-and-spicy peanut-based dipping sauce? What we know in the States is really only the tiny tip of a vast iceberg of regional variations, and my wife, Adri, and I made it a point to follow our noses to every satay vendor we could find in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. By the time we left the region a few weeks later, I'd made up my mind: I was going to re-create as many of my favorite versions as I possibly could. First on the list: the delicious pork satay I'd had at a night market on the north shore of Bali.", "totalTime": "2 hours", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Asian", "Grilling, Smoking, and Barbecue", "Mains", "Pork", "Snacks", "Summer", "The Food Lab"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Spice Paste:</strong>", "One (1-inch) knob fresh turmeric, peeled (about 10g), or 1 teaspoon (4g) ground turmeric", "2 stalks lemongrass, bottom 4 inches only, outer layers and root removed, thinly sliced (about 80g)", "8 medium cloves garlic, sliced (about 60g)", "2 small shallots, sliced (about 75g)", "3 whole dried <em>pasilla</em> or <em>guajillo</em> chilies, stems and seeds removed, roughly chopped (about 40g)", "2 tablespoons (about 30g) <dorado id=\"palm-sugar\" class=\"text\">palm sugar</dorado> or brown sugar", "2 teaspoons (about 6g) whole coriander seed", "1 tablespoon (about 9g) whole white peppercorns", "Kosher salt", "2 pounds (1kg) boneless pork shoulder, cut into 3/4-inch cubes", "<strong>For the Glaze:</strong>", "1 cup <em>kecap manis</em> (8 ounces; 240ml); see note", "1/4 cup sugar (about 2 ounces; 50g), plus more if needed", "One (2-inch) knob ginger, roughly chopped", "4 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped", "<strong>For the Dipping Sauce:</strong>", "10 ounces roasted peanuts (285g; about 1 1/2 cups)", "1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable or canola oil, divided", "1 ounce (30g) tamarind pulp, soaked and strained (see note), or 2 teaspoons (10ml) tamarind concentrate", "1 tablespoon (15ml) kecap manis or fish sauce", "Water, as necessary", "Sugar, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Spice Paste:</strong> Combine turmeric, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chilies, sugar, coriander, white peppercorns, and 2 teaspoons (8g) kosher salt using a <dorado id=\"mortar-and-pestle\" class=\"text\">mortar and pestle</dorado>, working in batches if necessary.
