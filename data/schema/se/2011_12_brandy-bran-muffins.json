There's something about the overly sweet, sticky lumps sitting in a cardboard box in my office kitchen that I've always found disconcerting. But the lightly toasted bran, and sweet, soft, boozy raisins make this recipe a muffin I crave.  Bran may not be the flashiest muffin, but it's the simplicity of the flavors in this recipe that drew me in.  If you end up with any leftover muffins the following morning I recommend cutting a muffin in half, smearing it in butter, then searing the buttered side in a hot pan until crisp.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "makes 12 muffins", "recipeCategory": ["Bread", "Breakfast and Brunch", "Breakfast Sweets"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup wheat bran", "1 cup raisins", "1/2 cup brandy", "1/2 cup buttermilk", "1/2 cup water", "1/2 cup brown sugar", "1/2 cup vegetable oil", "1 egg", "1 egg white", "3/4 cup all purpose flour", "1/2 cup whole wheat flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.
