Bello notes that for the final product, you should use <strong>coarsely ground pork</strong> with a <strong>meat-to-fat ratio of 3:1.</strong> Par-cooking it first in patty form (rather than loose in the pan) helps it retain juiciness and creates a large mass that you then break up into grape-size chunks for your pizza. Cook to just above pink. The seasoning measurements here are for 1 pound of ground pork. Size them up proportionally if you're making larger batches.", "totalTime": "15 minutes", "recipeYield": "makes enough for 8 to 10 pizzas", "recipeCategory": ["Pizza", "Pork"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound coarsely ground pork", "1 tablespoon fennel seeds", "1 teaspoon sea salt", "1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon garlic powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a large bowl, mix all ingredients together well.
