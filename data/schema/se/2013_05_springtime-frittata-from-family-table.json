WIth so many spring vegetables springing these days, I had plenty of small bits to turn into dinner. Or lunch. Or brunch.

Indeed, the combination of wholesome veggies, rich eggs (with extra yolks), and nutty Gruyere cheese is killer at any time of day. And while the recipe reads long, it can easily be broken up into two phases: the filling, and the eggs.
