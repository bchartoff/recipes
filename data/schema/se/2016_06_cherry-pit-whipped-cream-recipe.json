Instead of tossing them in the trash, toss them in the fridge with some cream. Cold-steeped for a few hours or even overnight, they'll give your next batch of whipped cream a delicate cherry flavor and color (although the intensity will depend entirely on the quality of your fruit). It's a fantastic complement to all-American cherry pie, or an elegant garnish for any summer dessert.", "totalTime": "Between 4 and 24 hours, as your schedule allows", "recipeYield": "Makes about 1 cup", "recipeCategory": ["Cherry", "Fruit Desserts", "Gluten-Free", "Mother's Day", "Valentine's Day"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 ounces cherry pits (1/4 cup; 70g), from 2 pounds (1kg) whole cherries (see note)", "8 ounces heavy cream (1 cup; 255g)", "2 ounces sugar (1/4 cup; 70g)", "1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much", "1/8 teaspoon almond extract, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine cherry pits and cream in an airtight container and refrigerate between 4 and 24 hours.

This can be done with a hand mixer as well. Enjoy immediately as a garnish for waffles and dessert, or refrigerate up to 1 week in an airtight container. If cream deflates over that time, re-whip before serving.</p>"}]}
