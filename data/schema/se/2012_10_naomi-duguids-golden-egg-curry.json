The eggs are hard-boiled, peeled, and then fried in turmeric-laced peanut oil. The tomato sauce is sparse but redolent of sauteed shallots, garlic, and chiles, leaving the eggs to take center stage. There may not be a runny yolk to mop up, but the golden crisped exterior of the eggs more than makes up for it.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Eggs", "Mains", "Tomato"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 large eggs or extra-large eggs, preferably free-range", "1/3 cup peanut oil or unroasted sesame oil", "1/8 teaspoon turmeric", "2 small shallots, minced", "2 teaspoons minced garlic", "1/4 teaspoon red chile powder, or to taste", "2 medium tomatoes (about 1/2 pound), finely chopped", "2 teaspoons fish sauce", "1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste", "2 or 3 green cayenne chiles, seeded and sliced lengthwise into 3 or 4 strips each"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place the eggs in a saucepan, add cold water to cover, bring to a boil, and cook at a medium boil for 8 minutes.
