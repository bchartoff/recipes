The bird is rubbed with a spiced (but not very spicy) blend of oregano, ginger, onion and garlic powder, paprika, and sage, and then set atop a can of Bud popped with a few cloves of garlic. The chicken is placed vertically in the pan and draped with slices of bacon. Since the cooking happens upright, the grease from the bacon drips down the chicken during the cooking, basting it with all of its salty smokiness.", "totalTime": "1 hour 10 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Chicken", "Cook the Book", "Mains"], "recipeIngredient": ["One 2- to 3- pound chicken, organic and free-range if you can", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 tablespoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon paprika", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground sage", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper", "One 12-ounce can beer ", "2 garlic cloves, smashed", "1/2 pound bacon (7 to 9 slices)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F.
