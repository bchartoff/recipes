Divide the dough in half. For a round loaf, or boule, line a round basket or bowl about 8 in in diameter (at the top) with a clean kitchen towel. Dust the liner generously with flour. To form the boule, on a floured work surface, press half of the dough into an 8-in circle. Bring up 4 opposite edges to the center of the circle, and press firmly with a finger to seal them together. Then bring up the remaining 4 opposite edges of the circle\u2014like gathering the edges of a piece of cloth into a sack\u2014so that all of the edges are at the center, and press with a finger to seal. Carefully place the boule, seam side up, in the lined basket. If making 2 boules, repeat with the remaining dough half and another basket. Sprinkle the top surface each loaf lightly with flour, cover each with a clean kitchen towel, and let the dough rise for 45 minutes.

(The baking sheet/tray makes it easy to move the risen bread and cloth.) On a floured work surface, pat half of the dough into a 6-by-4-in rectangle. Fold the rectangle in half lengthwise and press the seam to seal. Use your palms to roll the dough back and forth, gently moving your palms along the length of the dough to make a loaf as long as you want. I recommend you make it about 9 in. To taper the ends and leave the middle thicker for a b\u00e2tard, increase the pressure as you move toward the ends. Place the loaf, seam side up, on the floured cloth, and roll up the cloth against the long sides of the loaf to support it as it rises. Or, put the loaf, seam side down, in the floured baguette pan. If making 2 long loaves, repeat with the remaining dough half and another baking sheet/tray and cloth or the remaining baguette furrow. Sprinkle the top of each loaf lightly with flour, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let the dough rise for 45 minutes. The dough will look puffy and soft, but it will not rise a lot. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>When the dough has risen for 35 minutes, position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 475\u00baF.

Repeat with the second loaf. The loaves should now be seam side down and at least 2 in. Slide them gently to separate them, if necessary. Using a small, sharp knife, and holding it at a roughly 45-degree angle to the top of the bread, cut a long slash or a crisscross in the top of the round loaves, or a series of  4 or 5 evenly spaced, diagonal slashes along the width of the baguettes. Cut firmly to make each slash about 1/4 in. Sprinkle flour lightly on top of each loaf and re-cover with the kitchen towel. Let rise for 15 minutes. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Put the pie pan on the lowest rack in the oven 5 minutes before the bread is ready to go into the oven. When the bread is ready, sprinkle about 2 tbsp water over the rock to create steam, or sprinkle the same amount into the empty pan. There should be a burst of steam at the beginning and the steam should last for about the first one-third of the baking time. Put the bread in the oven and bake until browned and crusty, about 25 minutes. The bread will rise 11/2 to 2 in during baking. Remove from the oven, immediately slide onto wire racks, and let cool completely.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>You may hear crackling sounds as the bread cools, which is good.
