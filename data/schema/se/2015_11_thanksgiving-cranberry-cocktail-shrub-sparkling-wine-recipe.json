This autumnal cocktail gets its sweet-tart flavor from a shrub made with cranberries and spiced with black pepper. Its tangy flavor counterbalances a meal's richer flavors, and the shrub is great for parties, since it can be prepped in advance. For guests who aren't drinking booze, mix the shrub with chilled sparkling water instead of wine.", "totalTime": "8 hours, or up to overnight", "recipeYield": "Makes 12 servings", "recipeCategory": ["Champagne Cocktails", "Christmas", "Cranberry"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Cranberry-Black Pepper Shrub:</strong>", "2 cups (approximately 10 ounces by weight) cranberries", "1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, lightly crushed", "1 cup apple cider vinegar", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/2 cup water", "<strong>For the Cocktails:</strong>", "36 ounces chilled sparkling wine (from 2 bottles)", "20 dashes orange bitters", "12 ounces chilled Cranberry-Black Pepper Shrub", "Cranberries, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Cranberry-Black Pepper Shrub:</strong> In a nonreactive saucepan, combine cranberries, peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, sugar, and water.
