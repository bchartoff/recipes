On top, a heaping dollop of butterscotch whipped cream, which riffs on the rum, caramel, and dairy flavors of rum raisin ice cream. To finish, a little fresh nutmeg grated on top, which plays up those spice notes.", "totalTime": "5 minutes", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 drink", "recipeCategory": ["Christmas", "Coffee", "Fall", "Rum", "Winter"], "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup (175ml) heavy cream", "1 1/2 tablespoons (10g) malted milk powder, such as Carnation", "1 1/2 tablespoons (15g) dark brown sugar", "Tiny pinch kosher salt", "6 ounces (175ml) hot black coffee", "2 ounces (60ml) spiced rum", "1 tablespoon (15ml) 2:1 simple syrup (see note)", "Freshly grated nutmeg, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine heavy cream, malted milk powder, brown sugar, and salt in a mixing bowl or bowl of a stand mixer.
