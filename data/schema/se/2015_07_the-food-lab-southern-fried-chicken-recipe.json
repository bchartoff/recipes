But times have changed, and as is often the case, revisiting those fond childhood memories results only in disappointment and disillusionment. That said, stylistically, it can't be faulted. So I figured that I could somehow manage to take what the Colonel started and bring it to its ultimate conclusion&mdash;that is, deep chicken flavor; a flab-free skin; juicy, tender meat; and crisp, spicy coating&mdash;I might just be able to recapture those first fleeting childhood tastes of fried chicken as I remembered them.
