Most bowls consist of a gloppy mass of orange sweet liquid, giving way to a slightly sour and slightly spicy finish. Bites of mushroom, pea, and tofu add a bit of interest, but they can't save the soup bowl. But there's no reason why a homemade bowl of hot and sour can't make for a warming, pleasant meal. <strong><a href=\"http://bostonchefs.com/restaurant/sweet-basil/chef/dave-becker/\">Dave Becker's</a></strong> recipe in <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stewed-Collection-Soups-Braises-Stews/dp/0981850715/?tag=serieats-20\">Stewed</a></em> is one such example. He eschews the sweet element of too many take-out containers, instead favoring the naturally sour taste lemongrass, rice vinegar, and lime juice and the gentle heat of red chiles and white pepper. Carrots, shiitakes, bell peppers, and snow peas make up the bulk of the vegetables, and a small amount of rice noodles or rice turns the appetizer into a full meal. It's a far cry from any hot and sour I'd ever eaten--and that's a good thing.", "totalTime": "40 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Mains", "Soups and Stews"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons coconut oil", "2 cups carrots, scrubbed and cut into 1/4-inch wide slices", "2 cups Spanish onions, cut into 1/4-inch wide slices", "2 tablespoons celery, cut into 1/4-inch wide slices", "3 cups shiitake mushrooms, cut into 1/4-inch wide slices", "1 teaspoon lemongrass, minced", "1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and minced", "1 tablespoon garlic, minced", "1 cup rice vinegar", "1 cup sake", "3 dried bird's beak chiles", "1 1/2 quarts chicken stock or veggie stock", "Kosher salt and white pepper", "1 cup yellow peppers, cut into 1/4-inch wide slices", "1 cup snow peas", "2 cups cooked rice or thin rice noodles", "&nbsp", "<strong>Garnish</strong>", "Sesame oil", "Chopped fresh cilantro", "Lime wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat a saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, and then add the coconut oil.
