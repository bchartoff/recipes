No problem! These biscuits bake up tender, fluffy, and golden brown thanks to plain yogurt, which keeps them wonderfully thick and moist as well. They're primarily leavened with baking powder, with just enough baking soda to add a little <em>omph</em> to their browning and rise. This ensures the yogurt's tangy flavor shines through, a perfect counterpoint to the biscuits' buttery richness.\r\n", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "Makes about 14 two-inch biscuits", "recipeCategory": ["Baking", "Biscuit", "Breakfast and Brunch", "Father's Day", "Mother's Day", "Pastry", "Thanksgiving", "Valentine's Day"], "recipeIngredient": ["9 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 cups, spooned; 255g)", "1/2 ounce sugar (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight", "4 ounces cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 8 tablespoons; 110g)", "9 ounces plain yogurt, straight from the fridge (about 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons; 255g), see note"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400&deg;F.
