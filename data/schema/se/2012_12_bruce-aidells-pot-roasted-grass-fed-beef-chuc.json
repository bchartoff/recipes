To those folks, I say, \"Bah humbug!\" When properly prepared, like <strong><a href=\"http://www.aidells.com/our-way/aidells-story\">Bruce Aidells'</a></strong> <strong>Pot-Roasted Grass-Fed Beef Chuck with Winter Root Vegetables</strong>, the humble chuck roast can be just as enticing as a bone-in rib roast. This recipe, from <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Meat-Cookbook-Everything/dp/0547241410/?tag=serieats-20\">The Great Meat Cookbook</a></em>, produces a meal with multitudinous meaty layers--bacon starts the show, rendering its fat with which to sear the chuck, and a dense red wine reduction forms the backbone (along with beef stock) of the braising liquid. A flurry of root vegetables, shallots, slow cooked onions, garlic add deep vegetal flavor to complement the earthiness of the grass-fed beef. Best of all, the dish is almost entirely hands-off, sending its luscious aromas into the kitchen to entice even the most Scrooge-like of guests.", "totalTime": "4 hours to 24 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 6", "recipeCategory": ["Beef", "Cook the Book", "Mains"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Mustard and Paprika Rub</strong>", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme", "2 teaspoons sweet Hungarian paprika", "1 teaspoon dry mustard powder", "1 teaspoon light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons salt", "2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "&nbsp", "1 4-pound boneless grass-fed beef chuck roast, tied", "6 ounces slab bacon, cut into 1 x 1/2-inch-thick strips (lardons)", "2 cups dry red wine", "1/2 cup homemade beef stock, canned low-sodium chicken broth, or water, plus more if needed", "3 bay leaves", "4 cups thinly sliced onions (about 2 large)", "12 garlic cloves, peeled", "12 small shallots, peeled", "4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "3 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "1 small celery root, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Rub:</strong> Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl.
