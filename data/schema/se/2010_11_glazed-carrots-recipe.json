This recipe subs in ginger ale as a sweetener, and depending on which brand you choose it can lend a significant kick. I chose a super strong ginger beer, which reduced to a lovely glaze and left the carrots plenty spicy and gingery enough to wake you up. The sprinkling of chili powder adds a bit more warmth and spice, taking these carrots out of the realm of sleepy side and into the side dish spotlight.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Ginger", "Sides"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound carrots, about 7 medium, peeled and cut 1/4 inch thick on the bias", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Heavy pinch kosher salt", "1 cup ginger ale\u2014go for the good stuff", "1/2 teaspoon chili powder", "1 tablespoon fresh parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine the carrots, butter, salt, and ginger ale in a 12-inch saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat.
