Pulse the dough for 20 seconds to cool it slightly. Pour in the eggs and baking powder (still unwhisked) and process it all to a thick, sticky paste, about 90 seconds more. Add the vanilla and mix just until incorporated. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch (12-mm) star tip. At this point, the dough can be refrigerated: Wrap the pastry tip in plastic and then place a rubber band over the top of the tip so it's snug and keeps the plastic tight. Using a second rubber band, twist the top of the bag shut and fold the excess pastry bag over, pulling the rubber band over the excess flap. This will keep the dough fresh for up to 3 days before frying. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To make the donuts: Scoop the prepared choux paste into a lidded container and refrigerate it for 2 to 3 hours.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt the jam over medium heat until it is liquid.
