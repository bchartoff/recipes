If you have a wide, shallow strainer, you can place the zeppole foil side down in the strainer to transfer to the oil. The foil will separate from the zeppole in the hot oil with little to no effort after a few moments. Use heat resistant tongs to remove the foil. Cook until golden brown then using heat resistant tongs turn the zeppole and cook to the same degree of doneness, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side. Do not cook more than 2 to 3 zeppole at a time, as over crowding will cause the oil's temperature to drop. Use tongs or strainer to remove zeppole from oil, letting any excess oil drain off, then transfer to a wire rack for cooling. Test your first zeppole to make sure that the insides are completely cooked, if not, adjust your cooking time accordingly. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>When zeppole have cooled completely, pipe a little cream in the middle and up around the inner edges in a swirling pattern.
