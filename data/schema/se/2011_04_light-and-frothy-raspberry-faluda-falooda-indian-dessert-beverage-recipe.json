There's a place for it, but not during the first days of spring. This version froths pur&eacute;ed raspberries with milk (though you could as easily use yogurt, half-and-half, or melted kulfi ice cream). You could sweeten it as much as you like, layer it with whipped cream, or spike it with ginger and cardamom. This lighter version just adds a garnish of candied ginger, which you could also dice up and add to the basil seed.", "totalTime": "5 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 2 people", "recipeCategory": ["Indian", "Non-Alcoholic", "Other Drinks"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup (about 4 ounces) raspberries, cold", "1 cup whole milk, cold", "2 tablespoons honey, or to taste", "2 teaspoons basil seed, soaked for 10 minutes in six tablespoons water", "2 slices candied ginger, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pur&eacute; raspberries in blender until smooth, then blend in milk and honey until a light froth forms.
