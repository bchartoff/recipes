It's an Asian breakfast staple, a dim sum classic, and a blank canvas to add your own flavors. Traditionally white rice is used, but sometimes I like to use brown rice for a heartier, healthier porridge with a subtle nutty flavor. Heartier vegetables such as kale, escarole, shiitakes, leeks, and even Brussels sprouts are perfect in it. One of my favorite combos is this recipe: marinated strips of beef, dried shiitake mushrooms, and garlic chips.", "totalTime": "1 hour", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Beef", "Breakfast and Brunch", "Chinese", "Father's Day", "Garlic", "Mains", "Mother's Day", "Rice", "Soups and Stews"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Beef:</strong>", "1/2 pound ground beef", "2 teaspoons cornstarch", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons peanut or vegetable oil", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "<strong>For the Garlic Chips:</strong>", "1 head of garlic", "1/2 cup olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "<strong>For the Congee:</strong>", "6 dried shiitake mushrooms", "1 cup brown rice (long grain or short grain)", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1/8 teaspoon white pepper", "Scallions and/or chives, chopped (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Beef:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, cornstarch, soy sauce, oil, salt, and sugar.
