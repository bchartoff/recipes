Its unique texture comes from tapioca starch, which doesn't leave a chalky aftertaste like cornstarch, so resist the temptation to use what's on hand. You'll be rewarded with a light and lemony cookie that truly melts away on your tongue.", "totalTime": "About 5 hours", "recipeYield": "Makes about 40 (1-inch) cookies", "recipeCategory": ["Christmas", "Cookies", "Desserts", "Fruit Desserts", "Lemon"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Dough:</strong>", "3 ounces low-protein all-purpose flour (2/3 cup; 85g), such as Gold Medal", "1 1/8 ounces tapioca starch (1/4 cup; 30g)", "1 ounce powdered sugar (shy 1/4 cup; 30g), preferably tapioca-based (most organic brands are tapioca-based)", "1/8 ounce grated zest from 1 lemon (1 tablespoon; 4g)", "Pinch of kosher salt", "4 ounces cold unsalted butter (1 stick; 115g), cut into 1/4-inch dice", "1/4 teaspoon lemon oil or extract, optional", "<strong>To Finish:</strong>", "2 ounces powdered sugar (1/2 cup; 55g)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To Make the Dough:</strong> In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, tapioca starch, powdered sugar, lemon zest, and salt.
