The marrow bones are set on the bottom of a roasting pan along with onions and garlic that have been caramelized.

Sear the roast on all sides until it has a good brown crust, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer the roast to a plate and set aside. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and cook, stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. Settle the bones among the onion and garlic, arranging them into a rack. Put the roast on top of the bones and onion, then scatter the butter pats over the top of the meat. Add stock or wine to the bottom of the pan, making sure that the liquid does not cover the bones. Transfer the roasting pan to the oven and cook for 35 minutes, basting every 15 minutes or so with the pan juices and the stock. The roast is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat registers 120\u00b0F for medium-rare.
