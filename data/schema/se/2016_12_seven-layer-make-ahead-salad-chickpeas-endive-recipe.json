Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it's potluck food&mdash;not exactly the kind of dish you'd serve at a dinner party or holiday gathering. It's too bad, because the seven-layer salad offers one really serious advantage to the harried home cook: It's meant to be made ahead. You can assemble the whole thing several hours in advance and place it on the table with no need for further dressing or futzing. I decided to take the concept and upgrade it a bit with some more seasonal and holiday meal-appropriate ingredients.", "totalTime": "20 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCategory": ["Christmas", "Cucumber", "Legumes", "New Year", "No-Cook", "Quick Dinners", "Salads", "Thanksgiving", "Winter"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 small red onion, thinly sliced (about 4 ounces; 110g)", "3 tablespoons red wine vinegar (45ml)", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeds removed, and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 6 ounces; 170g)", "Kosher salt", "3/4 cup Greek-style yogurt (175ml) ", "2 teaspoons juice from 1 lemon (10ml)", "Handful chopped fresh dill, plus a few small fronds reserved for garnish", "Handful chopped fresh mint leaves, plus a few small leaves reserved for garnish", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (30ml)", "1 (15-ounce; 440 ml) can chickpeas, drained, rinsed, and dried", "1 large Belgian endive, core removed, thinly sliced lengthwise (about 6 ounces; 170g)", "2 large stalks celery, peeled and cut into thin slices on a sharp bias (about 3 ounces; 90g), plus a few celery leaves reserved for garnish", "6 to 8 radishes, scrubbed, trimmed, and cut into thin wedges (about 3 ounces; 90g)", "3 ounces crumbled feta or blue cheese (90g)", "3 tablespoons pomegranate seeds (45ml)", "2 tablespoons toasted sunflower seeds (30ml)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine onion, vinegar, and sugar in a small bowl and turn to coat.
