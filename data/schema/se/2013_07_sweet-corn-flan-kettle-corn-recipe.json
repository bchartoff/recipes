Cover tightly with aluminum foil and poke several large holes in foil. If baking smaller individual flans, check and rotate after 10 minutes, then continue to rotate every 5 minutes. If baking one large flan, check and rotate after 30 minutes, then continue to rotate every 10 minutes, reducing time to every 5 minutes once flan begins to set around edges. Flan is done when edges are set but center is still quite jiggly, but not liquid. Remove from oven and immediately (and carefully) remove flan(s) from hot water to cool on rack. Once cooled to room temperature, loosely wrap with plastic and refrigerate overnight.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Kettle Corn</strong>: Scrape seeds from vanilla bean and rub them into sugar with your fingertips until evenly distributed. Combine sugar, oil, butter and salt in a large pot and set over medium-high heat. Stir occasionally to prevent uneven heating. Once butter is fully melted and begins to foam, add popcorn kernels and cinnamon. Cover pot and shake constantly over the heat for several minutes. Popcorn will begin to pop; keep shaking. Popping will eventually slow, when there are a couple of second between each pop remove pot from heat and continue shaking until all popping stops. Immediately pour onto a parchment or silicone lined sheet pan and spread evenly. Once cool, break up any large chunks. Keep in an airtight container.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To Serve</strong>: If you made a large flan, get a serving platter or large plate with a bigger diameter than the pan you used. If you made individual flans, get as many plates as flans you will be serving. Run a paring knife around the edge of the baking vessel, being sure to scrape along the vessel so the flan edge isn't jagged. Invert platter or plate over flan and quickly but carefully flip the whole thing over so the flan rests upside down on the platter or plate. For a large flan, you can help it shimmy out by holding both the pan and the platter and giving it a couple firm shakes; for aluminum cups you can poke a tiny slit in the top to release it. You can tell it's out when caramel gushes out around the flan. Lift the pan or cup straight up. Garnish each slice or individual flan with a handful of kettle corn and some fresh berries, if desired.</p>"}]}
