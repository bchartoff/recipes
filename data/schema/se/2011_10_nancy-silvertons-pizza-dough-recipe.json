Her goal for the pizzas at <a href=\"http://www.mozzarestaurantgroup.com/\">Mozza</a> was to create a dough with an open hole structure, where the just baked crust was full of big, irregular air pockets, giving it an airy <em>cornice</em> (or outer rim).  For <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mozza-Cookbook-Angeless-Favorite-Restaurant/dp/0307272842/?tag=serieats-20\">The Mozza Cookbook</a></strong></em>, Silverton tweaked her dough recipe used in the pizzeria for home cooks (those of us who don't have the luxury of a high heat wood-fired pizza oven).", "totalTime": "4 hours", "recipeYield": "enough dough for 6 single serving (12 inch) pizzas", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Pizza"], "recipeIngredient": ["22 ounces warm tap water (2 cups, 6 ounces)", "1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) compressed yeast or 1 teaspoon active dry yeast", "26 ounces unbleached bread flour, plus more as needed", "1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) dark rye flour or medium rye flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons wheat germ", "1 1/2 teaspoons barley malt or mild-flavored honey, such as clover or wildflower", "1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) kosher salt", "Olive oil, grapeseed oil, or another neutral flavored oil, such as canola oil, for greasing the bowl\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To make the sponge, put 15 ounces of the water and the yeast in the bowl of a standing mixer and let it sit for a few minutes to dissolve the yeast.

Note that the dough will not pull so much that it completely cleans the bowl, but if the dough is too sticky and is not pulling away from the sides at all, throw a small handful of flour into the bowl to make it less sticky. While the dough is mixing, lightly grease with olive oil a bowl large enough to hold the dough when it doubles in size. Turn the dough out of the mixer into the oiled bowl. Wrap the bowl as before.
