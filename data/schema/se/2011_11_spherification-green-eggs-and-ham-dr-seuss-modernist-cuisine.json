Boil 375 grams of water and pour over peas. Blend until smooth. Pass through a mesh strainer, discard the solids, and measure out 500 grams of the remaining juice. Put one third of it in an immersion blender container and add the sodium alginate. Blend well, add remaining juice, and blend again. Let sit in fridge while you make the calcium chloride water bath. Add calcium chloride to liter of water in a shallow glass container. Stir with a fork until dissolved. In a separate shallow container, add an equivalent amount of cold water (for rinsing). Using measuring spoons of whatever size you want your spheres to be, spoon pea juice into calcium chloride bath in little spherical blobs. Using a slotted spoon, gently nudge the spheres around in the water. After two minutes, remove the pea spheres to the cold water. (You will have enough pea juice to make way more than eight spheres- roll with it. It\u2019s fun.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the toast:</strong> Mix the syrup, egg and cream until fully incorporated.
