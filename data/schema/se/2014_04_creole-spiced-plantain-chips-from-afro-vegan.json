With the tip of a sharp knife, slice the peel along the length of each plantain, avoiding cutting into the flesh. Repeat this in three different places on each plantain. Gently remove each section of peel. (Compost the peels and tips.) If the peels are difficult to remove, soak the plantains in hot water for a few minutes. Just be sure to dry them well with a clean kitchen towel before frying, to prevent splattering. With a sharp knife or a mandoline, slice each plantain as thinly as possible into rounds, ideally about 1/16 inch thick, keeping the slices of each plantain separate.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Put 1 tablespoon of the spice blend in a small paper bag.

With a skimmer or slotted spoon, immediately transfer the slices to the paper bag with the spice mixture. Fold the top to seal, then shake vigorously to evenly coat. Transfer to the lined plate. Repeat this process with the remaining plantains and spice blend. Serve while they are hot and crispy.</p>"}]}
