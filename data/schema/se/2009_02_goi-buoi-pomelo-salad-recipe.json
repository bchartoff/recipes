Over a high flame, heat a non-stick pan with oil until it begins to smoke. Use tongs to add about 8-10 scallops to the pan, taking care that the scallops don't touch. (The scallops exude a little juice as they cook. When overcrowded in the pan, they steam rather than sear.) After 2 mintues, the contact side will develop a golden crust. Quickly flip the scallops and sear again for another 2 minutes. (The scallops should be lightly browned on each side but still translucent in the center.) Plate scallops immediately, and sear the next batch as necessary. Once all scallops have cooled, halve them lengthwise into thinner discs. Set aside.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Pomelo: </strong>With a paring knife, peel off the thick outer rind and cottony pith of the pomelo.

STP plumps up scallops and increases the price per unit of weight. Unfortunately for the home cook, the excess moisture causes these pre-soaked scallops to steam rather than sear. Use dry-packed scallops if available and bring to room temperature to drain off fluids before cooking.</small></p>"}]}
