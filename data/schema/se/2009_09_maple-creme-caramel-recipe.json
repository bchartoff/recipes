The beauty of this dessert lies in its presentation. The custard is loosened from its cup and inverted onto a serving plate so that the maple caramel in the bottom of the ramekin drips down the sides and into a beautiful puddle. I'm not going to make a stink about Mrs. Butterworth's on my pancakes, but only Vermont maple syrup will do for this recipe.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "6", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Desserts", "Puddings and Custards"], "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup pure maple syrup, preferably Vermont-made", "1/3 cup pure maple syrup, Vermont Grade B", "5 farm-fresh egg yolks", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "2 cups whipping cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 275&deg;F.
