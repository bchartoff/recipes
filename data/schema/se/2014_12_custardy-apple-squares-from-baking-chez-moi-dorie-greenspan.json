If you have an orange or a lemon handy, you can grate the zest over the sugar and rub the ingredients together until they\u2019re fragrant. You can also change the fruit. Pears are perfect and a combination of apples and pears even better. Or make the cake with 2 firm mangoes&mdash;the texture will be different, but still good&mdash;or very thinly sliced quinces. Finally, if you want to make this look a little dressier, you can warm some apple jelly in a microwave and spread a thin layer of it over the top with a pastry brush.<br />\n</p>"}]}
