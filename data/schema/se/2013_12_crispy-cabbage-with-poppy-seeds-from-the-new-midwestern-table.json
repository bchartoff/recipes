Let the butter sit for a minute. Then tilt the pan and carefully skim off the solidified top crust with a spoon, taking care to remove as much of this stiff white froth as possible. Put it in a small dish. Pour the clear golden butter into another small dish, and pour the darker brown dregs at the bottom of the pan into the dish containing the froth. This can be done well ahead of time, even a day or two before; ghee keeps well in the refrigerator.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Ready your seasonings, because once the cooking starts, it will go fast.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat your very widest skillet over high heat.

Spread the cabbage out evenly and continue to fry over very high heat, stirring every 45 seconds or so, giving the cabbage time to caramelize on the bottom. Watch that it doesn\u2019t actually burn, but let it get a little dark on the edges. Cook until the cabbage has lost its raw taste but before it goes completely limp, about 5 minutes.
