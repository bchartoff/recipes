Now position the dough so that the pointed ends are on your left and right. Fold the top third of the dough over, pressing on the edge with the heel of your hand to seal. Then fold over the bottom third, aligning the edges. Press on the edge with the heel of your hand as you go along to seal the seam and form a fat roll. Turn the roll of dough seam side down. Place your palms in the middle of the log of dough and roll back and forth, fanning your hands out and pressing on the ends of the log to taper them, until the bread is the desired length and is fat in the middle with tapered ends. It is important at this stage to have an even thickness. If one side is thicker than the other, roll it back and forth until it evens out. </p>"}]}
