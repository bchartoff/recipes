The nice part about this dessert is that it uses already-baked pound cake, so you can't under-bake it. The grilled toastiness of the cake makes it the perfect canvas for any number of toppings: I really enjoy ice cream and a seasonal fruit compote. Just be sure to prepare this before grilling meats, because you don't want to impart a burger flavor to your dessert!", "totalTime": "25 minutes", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Cakes", "Cakespy"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound cake, sliced into 1-inch thick pieces", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "2 cups fresh seasonal berries", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "ice cream, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-low.
