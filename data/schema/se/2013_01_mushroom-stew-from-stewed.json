And while there's nothing wrong with a well-made butternut squash puree, sometimes a little more texture and funk is in order. Enter <strong><a href=\"http://bostonchefs.com/restaurant/sweet-basil/chef/dave-becker/\">Dave Becker's</a></strong> standout <strong>Mushroom Stew</strong> in his new book, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stewed-Collection-Soups-Braises-Stews/dp/0981850715/?tag=serieats-20\">Stewed</a></em>. A terrific amalgamation of wild mushrooms, enokis, dried porcinis, sherry, and spinach, this stew tastes of earth in the best way possible. The mushrooms are sauteed in a ripping hot pot to brown quickly without steaming, and are then simmered to tender perfection. A (very slight) drizzle of truffle oil (haters, don't hate) and a smattering of Asaigo cheese enlivens the stew upon serving.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Mains", "Mushrooms", "Soups and Stews"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 cup carrots, scrubbed, 1/4-inch dice", "2 cups Spanish onions, 1/4-inch dice", "1/4 cup celery, minced", "2 tablespoons garlic, minced", "2 cups oyster mushrooms, quartered", "2 cups assorted wild mushrooms (whatever\u2019s interesting at the market), cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 cup dry sherry", "1 cup dried porcini mushrooms", "1 quart chicken stock or vegetable stock", "Pinch chopped fresh sage", "1 cup loosely packed fresh spinach, chopped", "1/2 cup enoki mushrooms, separated", "Kosher salt and cracked black pepper", "&nbsp", "<strong>Garnish</strong>", "White truffle oil", "1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over high heat for 2 minutes, or until smoking hot.
