But this time I'm starting with a dish so iconic, so incredible, so damn-near-flawless in its original form that the best I can possibly hope to do is tweak it just a bit to suit my very particular personal tastes. I'm talking about the ricotta gnudi at The Spotted Pig, April Bloomfield's West Village gastropub. Thin, thin pasta surrounds a core of creamy, explosive sheep's milk ricotta all served in a brown butter and sage sauce. And the good news is that my favorite dish isn't even that hard to make.", "totalTime": "1 to 3 days", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6 as an appetizer or 2 to 3 as a main course", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Cheese", "Father's Day", "Mains", "Mother's Day", "Other Grains", "The Food Lab", "Valentine's Day", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the gnudi:</strong>", "16 ounces best quality fresh sheep or cow's milk ricotta", "2 ounces Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 cups semolina flour", "<strong>For Finishing</strong>", "3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter", "12 to 15 fresh sage leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the gnudi:</strong> Line a large plate with three layers of paper towels or a clean dish towel.
