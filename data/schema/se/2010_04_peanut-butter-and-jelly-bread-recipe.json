In a medium bowl, stir together the flours, salt, yeast, and the remaining egg. Blend the water and peanut butter in a blender until smooth (some settling will occur if this is left to stand, so blend just before using). Add mixture to the flour mixture and, using a wooden spoon or your hand, mix until you have a wet, sticky dough without any lumps, about 30 seconds.

Cover the dough with a towel and place it in a warm, draft-free spot to rise for 1 hour. The dough is ready when it has doubled. If you gently poke it with your finger, it should hold the impression. If it springs back, let it rise for another 15 minutes.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>About 15 minutes before the end of the second rise, preheat the oven to 450&deg;F, with a rack in the center.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Brush the top of the dough with the reserved beaten egg.
