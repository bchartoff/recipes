The ones from the store always reminded me of styrofoam and never had enough flavor to be worth my time. Then, in culinary school, I started messing around with chocolate left over from a molding lesson and some unused egg whites and I wound up with a meringue cookie to die for. They have a great texture and deep chocolate flavor&mdash;plus, they're gluten-free!", "totalTime": "2 hours, 30 minutes", "recipeYield": "12", "recipeCategory": ["Cookies", "Passover"], "recipeIngredient": ["3 egg whites (see note)", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 cup sugar", "7 ounces high-quality dark chocolate, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F.
