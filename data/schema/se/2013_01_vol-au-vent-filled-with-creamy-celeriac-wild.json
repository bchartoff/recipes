Flaky, crisp, and butter-rich, such a crust can transform many a ho-hum pile of fruit or bowl of stew into exciting new fare. Take the <strong>Vol-au-Vent</strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://yvettevanboven.com/\">Yvette van Boven's</a></strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Home-Made-Winter-Yvette-Boven/dp/161769004X/?tag=serieats-20\"> Home Made Winter</a></em>, for example. A simple stew of root vegetables, mushrooms, and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is good enough on its own; but place it inside a buttery pastry shell, and it turns into an elegant vegetarian main dish. Brightened up with a smidgen of red onion compote, and you'll have a real winter winner on your hands.", "totalTime": "2 1/2 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 6", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Mains", "Mushrooms", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the compote</strong>", "1 large red onion, cut into thin rings", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 sprigs fresh rosemary", "3 tablespoons (50 ml) red wine", "2 tablespoons raspberry vinegar", "1 tablespoons ginger syrup from a jar of preserved ginger ", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "\u00a0", "<strong>For the Filling</strong>", "4 1/2 cups (1 l) vegetable broth", "1/2 celeriac, peeled and cut into 1-inch (2-cm) chunks", "14 ounces (400 g) wild mushrooms, cleaned and torn or cut into equal pieces", "3 tablespoons (50 g) butter", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 onion, diced", "2 large cloves garlic, minced", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup (75 ml) cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1/3 cup (75 ml) dry sherry or marsala wine", "\u00a0", "<strong>For the Dough</strong>", "2 1/2 cups (300 g) all-purpose flour", "Salt", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (150 g) butter", "Ice water", "1 egg, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Make the compote first so that it can cool while you make the rest: Saute the onion in the oil over very low heat, and add the rosemary.
