Run your flat <em>lefse</em> stick (or thin spatula) underneath the dough and flip it onto the hot griddle. Cook until brown spots form on both sides, about 1 minute; you want it cooked through but still pliant enough to roll. Stack the <em>lefse</em> on a plate, and when they are cool, store the pile in a plastic bag at room temperature.</p>"}]}
