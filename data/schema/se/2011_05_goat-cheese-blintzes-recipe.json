As you might have surmised from this week's slew of goaty recipes, this version swaps out the usual cow dairy in favor of goat&mdash;in this case goat milk&mdash;cheese, and even goat butter.  These subtle substitutions make for an elegant blintz, not cloyingly sweet like the Jewish deli versions filled with sugary farmers cheese and topped with canned cherries.", "totalTime": "40 minutes", "recipeYield": "16 blintzes, serves 4 to 8", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Cheese"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the crepes:</strong>", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup (240 ml) regular or low-fat goat milk (or cow milk, if you must)", "1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "Goat butter (or unsalted cow butter, if you must), for greasing the skillet", "<strong>For the filling:</strong>", "8 ounces (225 g) fresh ch\u00e8vre or soft goat cheese ", "1 large egg yolk", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "4 tablespoons (55 g) goat butter (or unsalted cow butter, if you must)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Whir the two eggs and the milk in a blender (preferably) or a food processor fitted with the chopping blade until creamy.
