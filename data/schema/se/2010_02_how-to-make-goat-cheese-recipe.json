Let stand until milk starts to curdle, about 20 seconds. Don't expect curdles, like cottage cheese curdles. As you can see in this photo, slight clumping will occur, but nothing too drastic. Don't go pouring in a bucket of lemon juice, thinking nothing has happened. But you can add a few extra droplets if nothing is actually happening. Also: blood orange isn't as effective as lemon in creating the right curd texture, just sayin'.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Line a colander with several layers of cheesecloth\u2014really, several.
