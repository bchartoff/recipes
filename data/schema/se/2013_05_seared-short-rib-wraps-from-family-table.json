Sure, they have a reputation for being a vehicle for ho-hum, low-carb and bland diet food, but there's no reason they need to stay in such a category. Once filled with rich and spicy short ribs, soft and sticky white rice, and potent kimchi as they are in <strong><a href=\"http://www.ushgnyc.com/people/leadership/michael-romano/\">Michael Romano</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.karenstabiner.com/site/biography\">Karen Stabiner's</a></strong> <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Family-Table-Favorite-Staff-Restaurants/dp/0547615620/?tag=serieats-20\">Family Table</a></em>, the humble Bibb lettuce leaf transforms into the best sort of wrap. They're strong enough to contain its filling, yet supple and mild enough to not overpower their contents. It's the best excuse to eat with your hands. These particular short rib wraps are super easy to throw together: blend up a potent marinade and let the boneless rib meat drink up its flavor for a couple of hours (or more if need be), heat a heavy pan, and sear away.", "totalTime": "2 to 24 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Beef", "Cook the Book", "Mains"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Marinade</strong>", "2 tablespoons Korean chili powder or red pepper flakes", "1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar, or more to taste", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste", "5 garlic cloves", "1 tablespoon chopped peeled fresh ginger", "1/2 onion, coarsely chopped", "1 bunch scallions, sliced", "2 1/2 pounds boneless beef short ribs", "\u00a0", "<strong>Wraps</strong>", "12\u201318 Bibb lettuce leaves", "About 1/2 cup Chinese black bean paste (optional)", "Cooked white rice", "Thinly sliced peeled carrots", "Thinly sliced peeled daikon radish", "Store-bought kimchi or sliced sour pickles"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To make the marinade:</strong> Combine all the ingredients except the scallions in a blender and process until smooth.
