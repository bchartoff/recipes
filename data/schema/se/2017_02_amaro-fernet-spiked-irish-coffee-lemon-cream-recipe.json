Here, fernet's strong medicinal kick is boosted with a wonderfully perky lemon whipped cream. The result is a potent brew with loud, bright flavors that will send a jolt through your brain and your digestive tract, far more effectively than either caffeine or fernet could ever do alone.", "totalTime": "5 minutes", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 drink", "recipeCategory": ["Christmas", "Coffee", "Fall", "Liqueur and Fortified Wines", "Winter"], "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces (175ml) hot black coffee", "2 ounces (60ml) Fernet Branca", "1 tablespoon (15ml) 2:1 simple syrup (see note)", "1 recipe <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/03/lemon-chantilly-recipe.html\">Lemon Chantilly</a>", "Freshly grated zest of 1 lemon (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine hot coffee, fernet, and simple syrup in a prewarmed mug.
