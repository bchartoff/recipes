Toss beets, 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil, rosemary or thyme sprigs (if using), and salt and pepper to taste in a medium bowl until beets are coated. Add to pouch and crimp remaining edge to seal. (If using multiple colors of beets, roast in separate pouches.) Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Roast until beets are completely tender and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into a beet through foil meets little to no resistance, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and allow to cool. When beets are cool enough to handle, peel by gently rubbing skin under cold running water. Cut beets into 1 1/2&ndash;inch chunks. Beets can be cooked and stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place pistachios in a mortar and pound with pestle until lightly crushed but not totally pulverized.
