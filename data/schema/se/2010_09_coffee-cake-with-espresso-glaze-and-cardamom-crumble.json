The cake part is perfectly flavored and textured with a moist crumb and slight tang thanks to the sour cream in the batter.  After the cake bakes and cools, it's finished with a coffee glaze that seeps inside, acting as a glue for the cardamom-scented crumble topping.  It's one of those wonderfully deceptive recipes that at first looks like nothing fancier than your run-of-the-mill coffee cake, but one bite and the rich coffee flavors and aromatic cardamom are instantly apparent.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "6", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Desserts"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the cake:</strong>", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 cup sugar", "12 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 large eggs", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 cup sour cream", "<strong>For the glaze:</strong>", "2 tablespoons brewed coffee", "1 1/2 teaspoons instant espresso powder  ", "3/4 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar", "<strong>For the crumble:</strong>", "1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "2 tablespoons sugar", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "Pinch of salt", "1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup roughly chopped toasted pecans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To make the cake:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350\u02daF.
