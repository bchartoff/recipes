I hate the idea of precooking food before putting it into the slow cooker, but this is one of those times when it's a good idea. The browning will provide a bit of texture to the outside of the chicken pieces not achieved through slow cooking alone.  Dredge the chicken pieces in flour and dump the excess.  Brown the chicken on the stovetop in a bit of olive oil.  There's no need to fully cook, just get a bit of crust on the outside of the chicken.  Place the chicken in the stoneware.  Add the other ingredients, and toss gently to coat with the sauce.  Cover and cook on low for 6 hours, or on high for 3 to 4 hours.  Serve over white rice.</p>"}]}
