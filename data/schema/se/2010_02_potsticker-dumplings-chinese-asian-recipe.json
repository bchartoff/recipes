Spoon 1 tablespoon of filling onto each one.  Lightly wet the edge of each wrapper with water.  Fold the dough over and pinch around the edges.  This is easiest done by picking up each dumpling and pinching the edges with the thumb and forefinger.  Place on a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap to keep the dumplings from drying out.  Repeat until all filling is used.  (Freeze any dumplings that will not be cooked immediately.  After they are frozen, transfer them to resealable plastic bags or wrap in plastic.)</p>"}]}
