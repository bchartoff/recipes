Unfold the puff pastry onto a cutting board. Using a 5-inch cookie cutter (or an overturned bowl and a small, sharp knife), cut four 5-inch circles from the dough. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Press a 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter into the center of each round, stopping 3/4 of the way down so that the outer and inner portions are still attached at the bottom. This will allow the outer ring to rise around the center. Pierce the inner section of each round all over with a fork. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place the goat cheese, lemon juice and salt in a small bowl.
