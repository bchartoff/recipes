Cook until the bottoms are just golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the water and immediately cover the pan. Steam until the dough on the tops of the buns has turned translucent rather than opaque white, about 8 minutes. If there is still liquid remaining in the pan, uncover and continue to cook until it evaporates and buns are crisp. Serve immediately.</p>"}]}
