Another alternative is hot grilled, seared, or roasted fish.  For the parsley salmon, preheat the oven to 475\u00b0 F.  Toss the parsley with a drizzle of olive oil.  Season the salmon with salt and pepper.  Crust the tops of the salmon with parsley, and then place a layer of foil over the salmon, and weigh it down with a heavy pot for 10 minutes.  Drizzle a rimmed baking sheet with a touch of olive oil, and place the salmon, without the foil, in the oven for about 10 minutes.  Pour the mustard sauce over the top and serve hot, or serve room temperature with the sauce on the side.</p>"}]}
