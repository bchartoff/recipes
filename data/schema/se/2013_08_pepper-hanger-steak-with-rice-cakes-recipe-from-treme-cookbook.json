Place the rinsed rice in a small saucepan with the water and a generous pinch of salt. Bring the rice to a boil, uncovered, over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until most of the water has been absorbed by the rice, about 5 minutes. Cover the pan tightly, reduce the heat to low, and continue cooking for about 7 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes. The rice should be tender and all of the water absorbed. (Even very slightly overcooked rice is not a problem in this recipe, as that may help the rice cakes keep their shape.) Scoop the rice onto a small baking sheet lined with plastic wrap. Form the rice into a rough square 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight until cold and set. When the rice has set, cut 8 equal-size triangles of rice cake and set aside until ready to fry and serve. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To make the steak:</strong> Generously season the hanger steaks with the cracked black pepper and kosher salt.
