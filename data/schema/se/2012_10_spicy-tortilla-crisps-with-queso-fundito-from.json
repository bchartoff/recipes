It's not too hard to make either snack from scratch, but homemade versions are rarely more exciting than Tostitos.

Starting at either the left or right edge of a tortilla, cut a vertical strip that\u2019s about 1 inch at its widest point, at a slight angle. Moving inward, cut another long strip at a similar angle in the opposite direction. Continue zigzagging across the tortilla cutting long triangular strips that alternate between the point being downward and upward. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. You should get about 8 strips per tortilla.
