Heat herb butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until melted. Toss potatoes and half of melted herb butter in a large bowl to coat. Transfer to baking sheet and roast, shaking pan occasionally, until crisp all over, about 20 minutes. Re-melt remaining herb butter. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and toss with remaining herb butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper (you probably won't need any extra salt). Serve.</p>"}]}
