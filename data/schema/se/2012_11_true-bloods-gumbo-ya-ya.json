A rich and nourishing stew, this gumbo recipe makes a pot filled to the brim with chicken, sausage, peppers, and unctuous, meaty gravy. As many of the other recipes in this book, the <strong>Gumbo Ya Ya</strong> is fairly simple, but its well-developed flavors more than make up for its short ingredient list.
