Fold with a large rubber spatula just until the dry mixture is fully incorporated. Scrape the batter into the pastry bag.  Pipe low domes about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and 3/4 inches high, 1 inch apart, on the lined cookie sheets.  If your domes are pointy, smooth them with a wet finger. Without a pastry bag, use a spoon to scoop tablespoons of batter 1 inch apart onto the pans.
