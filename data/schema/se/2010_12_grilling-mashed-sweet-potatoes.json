Wrap each sweet potato in aluminum foil and set in coals. Using tongs, move any loose coals around or on top of potatoes. Roast sweet potatoes until they are completely soft and a paring knife can be inserted with no resistance, 40-60 minutes, turning four times during cooking to ensure even roasting. Remove potatoes from coals and let sit until cool enough to handle, 10 to 15 minutes. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Unwrap potatoes and split in half.
