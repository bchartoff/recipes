It's hard to face up to dishes that you used to love when you were young. I worried that this diner classic would seem heavy handed and greasy now. It usually features a whole mess of eggs along with ham, peppers, onions, and handfuls of cheese. It was never elegant, but strangely satisfying, even if finishing one always seemed like a dare.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "4 people", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Dinner Tonight", "Ham", "Omelettes"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon canola oil ", "8 ounces thick cut ham, diced", "1 green pepper, stemmed, seeded, diced", "\u00bd white onion, diced", "8 ounces button mushrooms, cleaned, stems removed, diced", "8 ounces cheddar cheese, grated", "2 tablespoons butter", "salt and pepper ", "8 large eggs "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pour the oil into a large non-stick skillet.
