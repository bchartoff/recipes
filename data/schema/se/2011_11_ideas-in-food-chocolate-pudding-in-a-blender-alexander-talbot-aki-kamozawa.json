Chocolate pudding is the ultimate comfort food, and this version is decadent without being overpowering. Use your favorite good-quality chocolate here because it will make your pudding that much better. A dollop of unsweetened whipped cream or lightly sweetened heavy cream poured over the top takes this to yet another level, although Aki has been known to eat it straight out of the container with a spoon. Jell-O pudding has nothing on us.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "6", "recipeCategory": ["Desserts", "Puddings and Custards", "Snacks"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 large egg yolks", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (28 grams) tapioca flour", "1/2 cup plus 2 teaspoons (110 grams) sugar", "1 cup (260 grams) heavy cream", "2 cups (460 grams) whole milk", "1 teaspoon (6 grams) fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon (4 grams) vanilla extract", "12 ounces (340 grams) 66% cacoa dark chocolate, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Put the egg yolks, tapioca flour, and sugar in a blender and blend on low speed until they form a light-colored paste.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine the cream, milk, salt, and vanilla in a saucepan set over medium heat.
