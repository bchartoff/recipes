I used a small bit of confectioners' sugar mixed with milk as \"glue\" between the rings. Oh, and don't worry about those little pieces you snip off to make the rings fit together; the excess pieces are excellent to snack on while you work.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><img alt=\"20100215olympicsurprise.jpg\" src=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/images/20100215olympicsurprise.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>"}]}
