But the reality is that perfection is difficult to achieve, especially if you're trying to roast that chicken whole. The problem is that chicken breasts dry out if cooked beyond 150&deg;F (66&deg;C) or so, but legs need to come up to 175&deg;F (80&deg;C). Spatchcocking, or butterflying, is the solution: By flattening out the chicken, you expose its legs to higher heat, helping them cook a little faster than the breasts&mdash;which is exactly what you want for juicy meat. It also yields crisper skin and a much faster cooking time than traditional roasting.
