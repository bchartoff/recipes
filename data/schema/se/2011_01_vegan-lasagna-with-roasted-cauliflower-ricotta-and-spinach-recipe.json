Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; that way the cauliflower won\u2019t stick. Place the cauliflower on the sheet and drizzle the oil over it. Spray it with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Toss it with your hands to make sure everything is salted. Spread the cauliflower in a single layer and bake for 10 minutes, then flip it with a spatula. You don\u2019t have to flip each and every one, so don\u2019t get OCD about it. Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned, tender, and toasty.\u00a0</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In the meantime, crumble the tofu into a mixing bowl.
