I've added a caramel to the mix, and turned up the spice with ginger and nutmeg. It's definitely not diet food, and it's highly addictive. It's a perfect sweet for serving at brunch with lots of people around. Making it alone is too dangerous.", "totalTime": "3 hours", "recipeYield": "8-10", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Breakfast Sweets", "Mother's Day", "Yeast Bread"], "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 recipe <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/08/brioche-bread-recipe.html\">brioche dough</a>", "1 cup dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup butter", "2 tablespoons honey", "1 teaspoon salt, divided", "1 cup granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons cinnamon", "1 teaspoon powdered ginger", "1/2 teaspoon nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Proof the dough:</strong> Remove brioche dough (that has chilled overnight) from the fridge.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the dough has proofed (the pieces should feel light, like soft, fragile pillows filled with air), combine sugar, spices, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Gently toss the balls of dough, a few at a time, in the sugar mixture. Place 10 of them gently into the bottom of the prepared pan, taking care not to squeeze them too close together. Sprinkle about 1/2 of the sugar mixture over the tops, then pour 1/3 of the caramel over them. Repeat to form a second layer of dough balls and top with any remaining sugar mixture and caramel. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pan on the center rack of the preheated oven on a sheet tray to catch any overflowing caramel. Bake for approximately 50 minutes, until the top crust is nicely browned, and a thermometer inserted in the center reads 210 degrees Fahrenheit. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes, and invert only a plate to serve. This bread is at its best if consumed shortly after baking, and may need to be placed in a 350\u00b0F oven for 10 minutes if it has cooled too much, to loosen the caramel.</p>"}]}
