His recipe for <strong>Mac and Greens</strong>, adapted in <strong>Ellen Brown's</strong> <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mac-Cheese-Creative-Versions-Ultimate/dp/0762446595?tag=serieats-20\">Mac &amp; Cheese</a></em>, fits right into his oeuvre. The recipe title is apt, as his mac contains just as much greenery as pasta. Braised collards and bok choy pair perfectly with the gooey cheddar-Gruy\u00e8re-Parmesan mix, and the hints of soy and coconut lend glutamate-rich depth.
