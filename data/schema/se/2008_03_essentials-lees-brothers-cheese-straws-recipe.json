(The Lee Bros. say dipping the knife in flour after every few inches ensures a clean cut, but the truth is that this is a tricky business and that more than a few of the \u201cstraws\u201d will break as you transfer them to the baking sheet. It\u2019s better not to get all perfectionist about it, since they will taste good no matter what shape they are.) Gently transfer the strips to an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving at least 1/4 inch between them.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Bake the straws on the middle rack for 12-15 minutes, or until the ends are barely browned.
