Eggs are added in two stages: yolks into the batter and fluffy whipped whites just before baking to ensure a wonderfully spongy cake. Instead of topping the cake with an overly sugary glaze, David opts instead to spread a thin layer of whipped cream over the top. Even without adding sugar the whipped cream has a lovely, delicate dairy sweetness that plays off the cake perfectly.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "8 to 10", "recipeCategory": ["Bake the Book", "Cakes", "Cook the Book", "Desserts", "Nuts", "Orange"], "recipeIngredient": ["Juice of 3 oranges", "Grated zest of 1 orange", "6 tablespoons dry bread crumbs", "1 cup ground almonds or almond meal or almond flour", "1 tablespoon orange blossom water", "4 eggs", "2/3 cup sugar", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "Whipped heavy cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Mix together the orange juice, grated orange zest, and bread crumbs, add the ground almonds and, if available, a tablespoon of orange blossom water.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Beat the egg yolks with the sugar and salt until almost white.
