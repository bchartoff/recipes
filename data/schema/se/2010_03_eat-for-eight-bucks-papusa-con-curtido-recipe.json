Keep turning every 15 seconds or so until the pupusa has a few brownish spots and has cooked 2 to 2 1/2 minutes in all. Remove from the griddle and keep covered with a towel while you cook the rest, stacking them atop each other as you finish. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Serve immediately or reheat by re-griddling 30 seconds per side or bundling in foil and baking at 350 for 15 minutes.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Curtido (cabbage salad with oregano; serves 4 to 6):</strong> Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and toss well to mix.
