It can come from a cart, a restaurant, or even a deli case--I don't really discriminate. But I probably should be more picky because most of the falafel out there isn't great. So much of the falafel I find is either greasy and falling apart or dense and dry. But after making <strong><a href=\"http://www.thekingfalafel.com/\">King of Falafel &amp; Shawarma's</a></strong> falafel recipe in <strong><a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/user/profile/BrooklynBrownie\">Alexandra Penfold</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.blondieandbrownie.com/\">Siobhan Wallace's</a></strong> new cookbook, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/New-York-Cart-Recipes-Stories/dp/076244682X/?tag=serieats-20\">New York a la Cart</a></em>, I may stop buying my falafel pre-made (unless of course I happen to be in Astoria and happen to stop by the Falafel King himself). These falafel are made properly, with soaked dried chickpeas and a whole party of spices. Rolled into small balls and fried for just a few minutes, they emerge crisp-tender and fragrant. They're perfect in pita sandwiches or eaten one by one, with your hands, dipped into a giant bowl of tahini.", "totalTime": "12 hours", "recipeYield": "makes 20-24 falafels", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Gluten-Free", "Mains", "Sandwiches", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans)", "1/2 medium-sized onion, quartered", "1 teaspoon turmeric", "1 teaspoon paprika", "1/2 teaspoon cardamom", "1/2 teaspoon nutmeg", "1 clove garlic, peeled", "3 springs of fresh parsley", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon red hot pepper flakes or 1 whole hot chile pepper", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "3 cups vegetable oil for deep frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pick out foreign matter from the peas before placing them in a large bowl, cover generously with water and soak uncovered, at room temperature overnight, adding more water if necessary.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Drain peas, and place them along with the other ingredients and 2 tablespoons water in a food processor.
