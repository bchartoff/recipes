Open a box, dump in a few ingredients and in two minutes you have batter. <strong>Would it be possible, I wondered, to create a homemade, gluten-free, one bowl cake recipe?</strong> Turns out, the answer is yes. This cake, which was inspired by the classic gluten-filled Hershey's \"Perfectly Chocolate\" recipe, comes together quickly.
