In this case, it refers to gelato in its purest form: no eggs, no fruit, no chocolate, or even vanilla&mdash;just pure dairy. For that reason, it's vital to use the freshest, most flavorful milk and cream, from grassfed cows. It's a perfect excuse to splurge on a few bottles from a local dairy, but if that's not an option there are a few national brands that are more than adequate to the task.", "totalTime": "5 hours", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 quart", "recipeCategory": ["Easter", "Father's Day", "Ice Cream and Frozen Treats", "Mother's Day", "Quick and Easy", "Valentine's Day"], "recipeIngredient": ["9 1/4 ounces plain or very lightly toasted sugar (about 1 1/3 cups; 265g)", "1 1/4 ounces cornstarch (about 1/4 cup; 35g)", "1/2 plus 1/8 teaspoon (2.5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, or more to taste; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight", "20 ounces best quality whole milk, preferably grass-fed, divided (about 2 1/2 cups; 565g)", "8 ounces best quality heavy cream, preferably grass-fed (about 1 cup; 225g)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a 3-quart saucier.
