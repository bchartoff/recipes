After about 30 seconds, the seeds will have turned into a fine powder. Continue processing 2-3 minutes, or until the powder starts to clump on the sides of the bowl. This is a sign that the natural oils have started to be released. Scrape the powder off the sides of the bowl and resume processing. Repeat these steps for 20-25 minutes, scraping the bowl every few minutes as needed. After 10-12 minutes, the powder will begin to clump into a crumbly dough; after 15 minutes the clumping should be more evident and even audible; after 20 minutes or so, the crumbly dough will miraculously coalesce into a mass of green clay. Scrape down the bowl again and continue processing until the dough becomes creamy and pourable. Turn off the processor and wait a few minutes. If shiny oil begins accumulating on the surface, the recado is ready; otherwise, process a few minutes more.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Prepare the squash seed sauce:</strong> Place the water, epazote, onion, and bouillon or salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil.

Add the hot broth to the squash-seed paste and blend. For best results, use an immersion blender to break up the paste and thoroughly emulsify it with the liquid. Alternatively, you may use a spatula or wooden spoon to break up the paste, then a whisk to blend until smooth. The final consistency should be like pancake batter. Add a bit more water or stock as needed to keep the batter-like consistency.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Assemble the papadzules:</strong> Warm a large serving platter. If the green sauce has cooled, warm it gently over very low heat. (Note: Do not allow the sauce to boil or it may curdle and separate. Also, as it heats it will continue to thicken; stir and scrape the bottom of the skillet frequently.) Working very quickly so that the ingredients stay warm, use a pair of tongs or your fingers to dip one side of a tortilla into the sauce, coating completely. Flip and repeat on the other side. Place the sauced tortilla to one side of the platter and spoon about 2 tablespoons (30 g) of the chopped egg down the center of the tortilla.
