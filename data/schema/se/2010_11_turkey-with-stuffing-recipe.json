Once the turkey was brought up to the safe temperature of 170\u00b0F, I took it out of the oven and nibbled on a few preliminary bites. How different is <em>true</em> stuffing?  The cooking turkey juices had seeped inside, making for a bready mix that was <strong>much moister, meatier, and deeply flavored than usual.</strong>  It made me fully appreciate why so many folks swear by the stuffed bird; it really does taste better.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Chicken", "Cook the Book", "Turkey"], "recipeIngredient": ["One 10- to12-pound turkey, giblets removed", "1 quart chicken broth", "2 ounces dried mushrooms", "1 cup onion, chopped", "1 cup celery, chopped", "1 cup green bell pepper, chopped", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus extra for the turkey", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus extra for the turkey", "3 cups challah bread, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "4 ounces dried cherries, about 1 cup", "2 ounces pecans, chopped", "2 large eggs, beaten", "2 teaspoons dried rubbed sage", "2 teaspoons dried parsley", "teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra for the turkey"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat the oven to 400\u00b0F.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Put the turkey in a deep bowl with the stuffing end up.

Reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and cook for another 60 to 75 minutes, until the bird and the stuffing both reach an internal temperature of 170\u00b0F. Remove the stuffing if using the bag. Let the bird rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Serve immediately.</p>"}]}
