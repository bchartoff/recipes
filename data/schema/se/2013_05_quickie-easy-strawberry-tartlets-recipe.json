Put the tuiles in the oven and bake until light brown, 8 to 11 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and while the tuiles are still warm, use an offset spatula to transfer a tuile from the baking sheet to the muffin tin. Using your fingers, press down in the center to create a shell that mimics the shape of each muffin cup. The sides will overlap or be higher than the muffin cup. That\u2019s fine. Your goal is to make a mini tart shell to fill with the strawberries. Repeat with the remaining tuiles, working with only one at a time. If the tuiles cool too much on the baking sheet before molding and aren\u2019t flexible, return the sheet to the warm oven for a minute to loosen them up before continuing. Let the tart shells cool completely.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Glaze the berries: Strain the liquid from the strawberries and pour it into a small pan.
