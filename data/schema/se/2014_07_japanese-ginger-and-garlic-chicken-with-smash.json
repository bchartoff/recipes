Add the shredded ginger. You can add shiso leaves if you can find them (I can\u2019t, I have no Japanese shop nearby). Nothing else really tastes like it, but I sometimes add mint. Serve the chicken with brown rice or rice vermicelli (the rice vermicelli is good served cold) and the cucumber.</p>"}]}
