The chicken is cooked skin-side down over high-heat until browned, and then the pan is covered and the heat turned to medium-low. The slow-cooking leaves the meat incredibly tender and flavorful. I initially worried that the sauce&mdash;made with curry powder, chopped mango, fresh mint, and rice vinegar&mdash;would be a little too sweet.
