Firm yet flaky, with a heartier texture and flavor than other widely available white fish on the market. Halibut cooks more like a thick steak&mdash;well-browned and -crusted on the outside, with a juicy, tender center. And, just like with <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak.html\">a steak</a>, cooking sous vide can help you nail that medium-rare center every time.
