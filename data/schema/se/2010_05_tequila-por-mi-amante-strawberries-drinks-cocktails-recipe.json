It's not something you put together to enjoy tonight&mdash;rather, it's an infusion that takes a few minutes of work and a few weeks of waiting, but the payoff is definitely worthwhile. <strong> Combining the bright, aromatic sweetness of strawberries with the peppery earthiness of tequila,</strong> Tequila por mi Amante tastes like joyous summer.", "totalTime": "3 weeks", "recipeYield": "makes about 8 servings", "recipeCategory": ["Tequila"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 quart very ripe strawberries", "Half of one 750mL bottle reposado or blanco tequila"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Wash and stem the strawberries and cut them in half (or in quarters if your berries are large). Place the cut berries in a quart-size jar, adding until the jar is about three-quarters full. Add tequila until the berries are completely covered. Store the jar in a cool place and let the mixture soak for three weeks, agitating the jar every day or so. After three weeks, taste the mixture; let soak for a few days more if necessary, otherwise strain through cheesecloth, lightly pressing the berry pulp to extract the last drops of infused tequila. Keep refrigerated, and use within a couple of weeks.</p>"}]}
