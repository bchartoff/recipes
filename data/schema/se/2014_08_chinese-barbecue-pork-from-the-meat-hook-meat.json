What you\u2019re doing here is rendering the fat and softening up the pork belly in the first hour, then reducing the braising liquid so it glazes the pork slices and turns them a groovy reddish color at the end. Continue to cook and stir until the pork has the reddish color you\u2019re after. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Remove the pieces of pork belly using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon and place them directly into your waiting hot dog buns.
