Suspend bowl over simmering water, whisking constantly by hand, until sugar dissolves and mixture is slightly foamy and hot to the touch. Move to mixer fitted with whisk attachment and whisk on highest speed to stiff peaks, about 1 minute. Generously dollop a large amount of meringue on top of cake and spread evenly around top and down sides of cake. Continue adding meringue to the sides and smoothing until completely covered, then even up the top. If you wish, transfer some remaining meringue to a piping bag or Ziploc bag with or without a star tip and pipe 8 kisses or rosettes evenly around the perimeter of the top. Fill center of top with brittle or peanuts, if desired. When slicing, be sure to wipe the blade of your knife with a damp towel between cuts to keep the frosting neat.</p>"}]}
