Adjust the total time up or down accordingly. If you cook your turkey low and slow, at 325 degrees or less, then add 20 to 30 minutes to the total baking time for the dressing. If your oven is set above 350 for other dishes, bake the dressing for fewer minutes, checking to be sure it doesn't dry out in the higher temps. You can also work through the first few steps a day ahead, refrigerating until ready to proceed. Add the cornbread, stock, and apples just before baking.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Alongside:</strong><br />\r\nApple and herb stuffed roast turkey<br />\r\nBaked honey ham <br />\r\nOven-fried buttermilk herb chicken<br />\r\nSage and thyme rubbed pork loin <br />\r\nFried catfish filets<br />\r\n</p>"}]}
