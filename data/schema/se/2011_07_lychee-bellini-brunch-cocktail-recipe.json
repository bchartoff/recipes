A dry Prosecco would be excellent as well.", "totalTime": "8 minutes", "recipeYield": "One 12-ounce cocktail", "recipeCategory": ["Champagne Cocktails"], "recipeIngredient": ["6 lychees (if using fresh, peel and remove pits)", "8 ounces chilled, dry sparkling wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Puree the lychees with a blender (immersion blender works great).
