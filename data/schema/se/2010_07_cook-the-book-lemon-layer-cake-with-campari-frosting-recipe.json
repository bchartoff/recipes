I love limoncello, and seems like a ingredient that should be used in baking projects way more often than it is.  And Campari and soda is one of my favorite drinks, especially in the summer months.

Incorporating these two Italian favorites into a pink frosted layer cake seemed like they might just be the best summer dessert ever.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "one 8-inch layer cake, about 12 servings", "recipeCategory": ["Bake the Book", "Cakes", "Cook the Book", "Desserts"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the cake:</strong>", "11/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 cup cake flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened", "11/4 cups sugar", "3 large eggs", "3/4 cup buttermilk", "2 tablespoons limoncello", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 tablespoon grated lemon zest ", "<strong>For the buttercream frosting:</strong>", "1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened", "3 to 4 cups confectioners' sugar", "1 tablespoons milk", "2 tablespoons limoncello", "1 tablespoon Campari "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To make the cake, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.
