Salmon has it beat by a mile. With practice, you can get to the point of nailing a perfect medium-rare center on a piece of poached or pan-seared salmon. But practicing on salmon can get pricey, and sous vide will guarantee perfectly moist, tender results each time. Sous vide also allows you to achieve textures you never knew were possible, from buttery-soft to meltingly tender and flaky-yet-moist.", "totalTime": "About 1 hour 15 minutes or up to overnight", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Dairy-Free", "Easter", "Gluten-Free", "Mains", "Salmon", "Sous Vide", "The Food Lab"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 salmon fillets (5 to 6 ounces; 140 to 170g each)", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil ", "Aromatics such as fresh thyme, dill, parsley, thinly sliced shallots, and/or citrus zest (optional)", "2 teaspoons (10ml) vegetable oil, if serving seared"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Season salmon generously with salt on all sides.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place salmon in a single layer in a gallon-size zipper-lock bag, or in batches in quart-size bags.
