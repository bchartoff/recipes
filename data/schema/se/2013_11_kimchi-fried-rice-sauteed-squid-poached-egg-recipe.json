Set a medium-pot of water over medium heat until it reaches 180&deg;F, approximately at the point where the water starts to quiver but is not simmering. Adjust heat to low or medium-low to maintain the temperature. Crack each egg into a separate bowl. One at a time, transfer an egg to a fine mesh strainer, gently swirl it around until the excess white is removed, and then gently lower the egg into the pot and roll it into the water using the strainer. Once all the eggs are added, use a large slotted spoon to carefully move them around until they form a nice egg shape. After the whites set, about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes, remove eggs with the strainer, and transfer each one to a bowl of fried rice. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Top each bowl with a quarter of the sesame seeds and sliced nori.
