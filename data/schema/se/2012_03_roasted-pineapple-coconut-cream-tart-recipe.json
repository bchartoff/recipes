Spread the whipped pastry cream over the top, so it leaves a few centimeters of room for the pineapple rounds. Press the rounds into the surface of the tart, so the pastry cream and pineapple are flat across the surface. Sprinkle with sugar all over, brulee the top so the sugar burns and caramelizes. Serve immediately.</p>"}]}
