This loose, almost soup-like stew of beans and meat was so far removed from all versions of cassoulet I'd had in the United States, or even in other parts of France. It was a large, bubbling vat of beans and meat, covered in a crust so dark that it was almost <em>black</em>. Rich, meaty, and overwhelmingly simple, the main flavor was just that of the cured meat, a good stock, and beans.", "totalTime": "About 6 hours, plus overnight for beans to soak", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCategory": ["Chicken", "Dairy-Free", "French", "Mains", "Other Meats", "Pork", "Soups and Stews", "The Food Lab"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried cannellini beans", "Kosher salt", "1 quart homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock", "3 packets (3/4 ounces) unflavored gelatin, such as <dorado id=\"unflavored-gelatin\" class=\"text\">Knox</dorado> (see note)", "2 tablespoons duck fat (optional)", "8 ounces salt pork, cut into 3/4-inch cubes", "6 to 8 pieces of chicken thighs and drumsticks, or 4 whole chicken leg quarters", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound garlic sausage (2 to 4 links depending on size)", "1 large onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)", "1 carrot, unpeeled, cut into 3-inch sections", "2 stalks celery, cut into 3-inch sections", "1 whole head garlic", "4 sprigs parsley", "2 bay leaves", "6 cloves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a large bowl, cover beans with 3 quarts water and add 3 tablespoons salt.
