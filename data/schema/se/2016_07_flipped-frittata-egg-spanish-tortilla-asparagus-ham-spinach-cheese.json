But you can still make this vegetable-packed frittata: Just flip it like a Spanish tortilla. Compared to a normal finished-in-the-oven frittata which can take on a poofy, souffl\u00e9d texture, flipping produces a much creamier, denser omelette. It's a texture I actually prefer.", "totalTime": "20 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 3 to 4", "recipeCategory": ["Asparagus", "Breakfast and Brunch", "Cheese", "Easter", "Ham", "Mains", "Omelettes", "Quick Dinners", "Spinach"], "recipeIngredient": ["6 eggs", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided (60ml)", "4 stalks asparagus, sliced on a bias into 1-inch pieces", "6 shishito peppers or one green bell pepper, diced", "3 medium cloves garlic, sliced", "1/2 medium red onion, sliced (about 4 ounces; 120g)", "1 cup packed spinach leaves, roughly chopped (about 2 ounces; 55g)", "3 ounces sliced ham, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (90g) (optional)", "4 ounces medium-firm cheese such as cheddar or Jack, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (120g)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Lightly beat eggs with a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a large bowl.

Use rubber spatula to again press the sides in all around to form a rounded puck shape. Continue to cook frittata until lightly browned on second side but still tender in the center when pressed with a finger, about 2 minutes longer.
