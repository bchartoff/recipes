It's also an easy loaf to make. Since gluten develops during the long overnight rest in the refrigerator, it requires just a little kneading. The overnight cold rest also helps develop flavor, so not only is it an easy loaf, it's also tasty.", "totalTime": "4 hours, plus overnight rest", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 loaf", "recipeCategory": ["Bread", "Bread Baking"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups warm water", "2 1/4 teaspoons  instant yeast", "1 tablespoon sugar", "9 ounces (2 cups) white whole wheat flour", "2 1/4 ounces (about 1/2 cup) bread flour", " 1/4 cup instant mashed potato flakes", "1 teaspoons salt", "2 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine the water, yeast and sugar in a small bowl or measuring cup and stir to combine.

If the cornmeal sticks to the sides of the pan, that\u2019s fine, too. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Flour your work surface and turn the dough out. The dough will be very soft and sticky at first. Knead the dough until it feels smooth and elastic, just a minute or two, adding flour as needed to keep it from sticking to the work surface. Try to add as little flour as possible, though, to keep the dough soft. Form the dough into a log about 8 inches long, to fit inside the bread pan. Place the loaf seam-side down in the pan and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside until it has risen just beyond the top of the pan, about 30 minutes.<br />\n</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Remove the plastic wrap, slash the loaf down the center, and bake at 325\u02da until the loaf is nicely browned and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, about 40 minutes.
