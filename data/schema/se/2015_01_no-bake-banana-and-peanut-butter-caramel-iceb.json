Heat over medium to high heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture comes to a rolling boil. Stop stirring and cook over high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sugar develops brown streaks. Swirl the pan by the handle and watch for the first sign of smoke. As soon as the caramel turns dark brown and smokes, take the pan off the heat and whisk in the heavy cream. Be careful&mdash;the mixture will steam and bubble up violently. Return the pan to the heat and bring the caramel sauce to a simmer over low heat.
