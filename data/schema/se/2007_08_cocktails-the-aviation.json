Because the drink's earliest printed recipe (in 1917) called for the inclusion of <strong>creme de violette</strong> (creme Yvette was a notable proprietary brand), a violet-flavored and colored liqueur that gave the drink a cerulean hue that brought to mind the wild, blue yonder. Production of creme Yvette was discontinued decades ago, but fortunately, a new violet liqueur from <a href=\"http://www.hausalpenz.com\">Rothman &amp; Winter</a> appeared in New York last month; starting this month, it should start trickling into California. Keep an eye out for a bottle, so you can mix up an authentic aviation.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCategory": ["Gin"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces gin", "3/4 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice", "2 teaspoons maraschino liqueur", "Optional: 1 teaspoon cr\u00e8me de violette"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pour ingredients into a cocktail shaker; fill with ice, and shake well for 10 seconds.
