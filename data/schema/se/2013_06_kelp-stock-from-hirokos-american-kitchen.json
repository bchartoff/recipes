On the ends of the swollen kelp you will see some oozing of a slimy liquid. This is a healthful, dietary fiber and a portion of it has already been dissolved in the stock. If a greenish slimy substance is leaking out into the water and is clouding the stock, it is a sign that you are using poor-quality kelp, as stock prepared from good-quality kelp will be clear in appearance. If necessary, strain the stock through a sieve lined with a moist, sturdy paper towel to remove any impurities. The stock is then ready to be used, or it can be refrigerated for 2 to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months.</p>"}]}
