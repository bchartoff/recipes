Press the bottom of the drinking straw so that two opposite sides of the straw meet.  Tape to secure.  Trip off the bendy top of the straw.  Using honey in a squeezable plastic bottle makes this infinitely less difficult.  Stick the open end of the straw inside the honey bottle, turn the bottle upside down, and gently fill the straw about 4/5 of the way up with honey.  Use the pipette (or a steady hand) to add 4 or 5 drops of extract into the straw, and massage it a bit into the honey.  Use different colored straws for different flavors, and make as many or as few as you want.  One word of caution: don't make these too far in advance.  One night out on the counter and the honey will seep through the tape on the bottom of the straws.</p>"}]}
