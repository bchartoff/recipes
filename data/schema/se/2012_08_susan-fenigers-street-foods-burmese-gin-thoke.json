Her recipe combines a blend of melons--watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew--with a potent mix of young ginger, sesame, and coconut. Next, the salad is then bulked up with blanched peanuts and strangely perfect green lentils and then dressed with a bit of sugar, soy sauce, and lime juice. It sounds like a crazy combination, but it works.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 6", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Gluten-Free", "Melon", "Salads", "Sides", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 small seedless watermelon (2\u00bd pounds)", "1/2 ripe cantaloupe melon (1 1/2 pounds) ", "1/4 ripe honeydew melon (1 pound)", "2 (3-inch) pieces young ginger, peeled and minced (1/3 cup), or 2 (3-inch) pieces regular ginger, peeled and minced (1/3 cup)", "1/4 cup sesame seeds, toasted", "1/4 cup lime juice (from 3 to 4 limes)", "1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar", "1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 cup dried green lentils", "2 cups wide-flake unsweetened coconut", "1 1/4 cups blanched raw peanuts", "4 fresh kaffir lime leaves, chopped "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Start by cutting up the melons: Trim off the rind of all 3 melons, remove any seeds, and cut the flesh into 1/2 \u00adinch dice.
