Heat the sunflower oil in a pan. Add the butter and when it has melted, stir in the flour with a wooden spoon.

Season with salt and stir in the ham, then spread the mixture out in a large, shallow dish to cool for at least 2 hours. Using 2 tablespoons, shape scoops of the mixture into croquettes.

Spread out the bread crumbs in another shallow dish. Roll each croquette lightly in the bread crumbs, then in the beaten egg and finally in the bread crumbs again, making sure that each one is evenly covered. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or deep pan to 350 - 375&deg;F, or until a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds. Carefully add the croquettes, in batches of about 6 at a time, and cook until crisp and golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a large colander set over a baking pan and place in a warm oven until all the croquettes have been cooked.
