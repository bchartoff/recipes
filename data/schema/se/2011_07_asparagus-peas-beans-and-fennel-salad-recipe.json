(Store the dressing in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Shake to blend again before using.) But will it curdle? Given the right circumstances, such as the addition of acids or heat, any milk or cream product will curdle (meaning the curd protein coagulates and forms clumps). The greater the fat content of the milk or cream, the more it will resist curdling. I use a light cream with a 12% fat content, much like what is also called half-and-half, and have never had a problem with curdling when adding lemon juice to the cream.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the salad:</strong> Prepare 4 large bowls of ice water.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Trim the asparagus, discarding the woody ends.
