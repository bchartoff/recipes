Use another shape cutter if you like; just make sure it leaves enough space in the middle to cut out the space for the candy filling. Use a smaller (1 inch or so) cutter in the shape of a circle, heart, star, diamond, or what-have-you to cut out the centers. A bagel or doughnut cutter works well here-it cuts out the cookie and its center hole at the same time. If the dough isn't cold enough, refrigerate the sheets and cut out the centers when the dough is a bit easier to work with. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Bake the cookies for 8 minutes, or until they're barely firm and still somewhat pale; they'll be just lightly browned around the outer edges.

Next, without stirring, cook the syrup until it reaches 300\u00b0F to 310\u00b0F (hard-crack stage) on a candy thermometer. Remove the syrup from the heat and take one measuring cup from the oven.

Stop pouring just as the syrup comes to the top level of the cookie. Be careful; this is an extremely hot process and you may need to take a break halfway through to give your hand a rest. Alternatively, you can use a small (teaspoon) cookie scoop to dip syrup out of the cup and deposit it in the cookie centers; fill the scoop about halfway. This prevents the mild discomfort of holding onto a hot glass for a long time.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Use the second and/or third cup and the rest of the syrup, colored and flavored differently, to fill the centers of the remaining cookies.
