Roll the dough to a little shy of 1/4\u201d thick. This is important. Each Pop-Tart will ultimately have 4 \u201clayers\u201d (pastry + filling + pastry + icing), so pay close attention to the thickness of each. If you don\u2019t, you may wind up with massively thick Pop-Tarts.

Roll the dough evenly both left-and-right and up-and-down, but don\u2019t roll diagonally! This will preserve the square shape and minimize re-rolling. Lift and move the dough periodically to make certain it hasn\u2019t stuck, dusting underneath as needed. (If you discover a patch is stuck, slide an offset metal spatula between the dough and the counter to loosen. Pull back the dough and dust the patch with powdered sugar.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the dough has reached about a 1/4\u201d thickness and an overall square shape, use a ruler to cut it into a series of 3 1/8\u201d wide strips. Cut each strip at 4 inch intervals. Gather up any remaining scraps, roll, and cut likewise until you have 24 pieces all together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On half of the pieces, place about a tablespoon of prepared filling. Use your fingers to scatter the filling into a rectangular shape, leaving a 1/4\" margin all around the edges.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To seal and bake the tarts: </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cover each filled tart with a plain dough piece.

Do not use a fork to crimp the edges; have you ever seen a Pop Tart before? No crimping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you\u2019ve smoothly sealed the edges of the Pop-Tart, carefully prick the surface with a fork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use a bench knife or spatula to transfer the Pop-Tarts to a parchment lined cookie sheet. Bake for about 20 minutes, until barely beginning to take on some color.
