When the emulsion is established (which should happen after about 1/3 cup oil has gone in), add the oil in a thin stream of droplets.

I ate it runny and then re-emulsified it the next day: Whisk up the broken sauce. Whisk a spoonful of it into a spoonful of mustard or of crushed hard-boiled egg yolk. When the spoonful of mayonnaise and mustard or yolk are smoothly combined, start whisking in the broken sauce bit by bit. Eventually it will turn thick and glossy and beautiful as ever. But, I discovered, it will still weep some oil and get a little grainy as it rests. (Harold McGee tells us that throughout time and around the world, versions of mayonnaise have been made with b\u00e9chamel sauce, hard-boiled egg yolks, cooked potato, garlic, bread, and fresh cheese, but that \u201cNone of these ingredients is as effective at emulsifying and stabilizing as a raw egg yolk, so they will emulsify less oil and the sauces will tend to leak some free oil.\u201d) If this happens\u2014leaky oil and slight graininess, as opposed to a completely liquefied sauce\u2014just whisk the mayonnaise before eating, and it should firm up nicely enough.</p>"}]}
