Carefully mash the blueberries with a potato masher until none remain whole. Increase the heat to medium and keep the mixture at a steady simmer for 8 minutes, stirring frequently. While the blueberries cook, place the sugar in a large heatproof bowl. Line a fine mesh sieve with cheesecloth and place it over the bowl. Carefully pour the blueberry mixture into the sieve and allow it to drip until the dripping becomes intermittent, about 5 minutes. Lift up the sieve and stir the syrup until the sugar is dissolved. Place the sieve back on the bowl and allow to drip until the dripping stops, about 5 minutes longer. Save the solids for another use. Let the syrup cool to room temperature and refrigerate. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Soda</strong>: Combine blueberry syrup, lime juice, and seltzer.
