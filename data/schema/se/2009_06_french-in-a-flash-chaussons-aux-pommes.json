Though it is an old-sounding word, it expresses timeless human emotion far more effectively and evocatively than the more modern \"turnover\" ever could. Mine start simply with Golden Delicious apples, done French--as in, without cinnamon. They are folded into a simple pocket of bought puff pastry. The American apple-cinnamon duo is completed with a slightly sweet, certainly spicy cinnamon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in which to dip the warm <em>chausson</em> before munching it down burning from the oven.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "8", "recipeCategory": ["Apple", "French", "Pastry"], "recipeIngredient": ["3 Golden Delicious apples", "3 tablespoons sugar, plus extra for sprinkling", "1 tablespoon flour", "Pinch of salt", "juice of 1/4 lemon", "4 sheets of frozen puff pastry, thawed but cold (from 2 boxes, preferably pure butter)", "1 egg, beaten for an egg wash", "\u00a0", "For the Cinnamon Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche: ", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon", "3 tablespoons powdered sugar", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
