Gently stir in the dissolved baking soda, mixing well. Drop about 1/4 cup of the batter into each hot ring; it will spread evenly. Cook the crumpets over low heat until the bottom is browned and a firm skin has formed on top, about 10 minutes. Bubbles will form on the tops as the crumpets cook, and the tops should feel firmly baked and not sticky when touched lightly with a finger. Use tongs to lift off the rings and set them aside. If the crumpets stick to the rings (they won\u2019t if the rings are well greased), jiggle the rings gently with the tongs and the crumpets should release. Turn the crumpets over and cook just until the second sides are firmly set, a minute or less. The insides of the crumpets will be soft. Transfer to a plate and serve, or keep warm in a low oven (250\u00baF) while the second batch cooks. Before you cook the second batch, gently stir down the batter (it will bubble up and rise while the first batch cooks) and spray the rings and griddle again.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Serve the crumpets hot with butter.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>The crumpets can be covered and stored at room temperature for to 2 days.
