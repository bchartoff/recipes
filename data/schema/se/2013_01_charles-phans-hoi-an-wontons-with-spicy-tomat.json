There, much of the food is a mash-up of cultures (including even Japan), so serving fried wontons is not a major leap, cuisine-wise. Phan's fried wontons use the same filling as his wonton soup--mainly shrimp, pork, mushrooms, and chestnuts--but here they are sealed like ravioli (no tricky folding!) and fried in canola oil. The richness of the dumplings is balanced by serving them with a spicy tomato sauce spiked with fish sauce.", "totalTime": "2 hours and 15 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 8 to 10", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Cook the Book", "Pork", "Shrimp", "Vietnamese"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Tomato Sauce</strong>", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "3/4 cup thinly sliced shallots", "2 teaspoons minced garlic", "4 Thai chiles, stemmed and minced", "2 tablespoons rice wine", "2 pounds ripe tomatoes (such as Roma or Early Girl), cored and diced", "3/4 cups chicken stock ", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "&nbsp", "<strong>Pork and Shrimp Wonton Filling</strong>", "8 ounces shrimp, peeled, deveined, and finely chopped", "4 ounces ground pork", "1/3 cup <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/charles-phans-fried-shallots.html\">fried shallots</a>", "3 tablespoons <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/charles-phans-fried-shallots.html\">shallot oil</a>", "1 1/3 cups finely chopped fresh water chestnuts or jicama", "1/3 cup black trumpet mushrooms", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro", "2 tablespoons finely chopped scallion, white and light green parts only", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon oyster sauce", "1 tabelspoon sesame seeds, toasted and ground to a coarse powder", "1 tablespoon finely minced shallot", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil", "Pinch ground black pepper", "&nbsp", "50 square wonton wrappers (1-pound package)", "Cornstarch, for dusting", "Canola oil, for deep-frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To make the tomato sauce:</strong> In a saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat.
