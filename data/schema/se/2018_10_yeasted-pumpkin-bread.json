To test the dough, poke it gently with a flour-dusted fingertip; when the dough is ready, it will retain a shallow impression that springs back after a few minutes.

Pat the dough into a 7-inch square, and form into a tight log, sealing the dough together with your heel. Nestle into a lightly greased loaf pan, seam side down, then cover and proof as before (for dinner rolls, see note on shaping below). The dough will be ready when it's puffy and light, and risen about 2 inches above the rim of the pan. This will take about 2 hours at around 72&deg;F; the process will move faster at warmer temperatures, and slower when it is cool; the dough's readiness can be tested as before.
