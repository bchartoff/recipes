Some people like it melted but still white. Some like little brown bubbles on the surface. And some people like to go even further: they like their melted cheese really browned and crispy. My personal favorite way to eat melted cheese is when there are little dots of brown all over, just like little dots on a banana. Remove and serve immediately. </p>"}]}
