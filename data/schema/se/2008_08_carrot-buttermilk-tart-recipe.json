Using a spice mill or small food processor, grind the cereal to a fine powder.  Combine cereal with remaining crust ingredients and whisk to thoroughly distribute.  Add half of this dry mixture to the butter mixture, and mix to just incorporate.  Scrape around the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl, then add the remaining dry mixture.  Mix just to incorporate.

If you do not have 5-Spice, you may substitute any one or a blend of the typical 5-Spice components to suit your tastes.</p>"}]}
