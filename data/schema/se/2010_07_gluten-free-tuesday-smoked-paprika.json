I love it. (<em>Why don't you marry it?</em> Pee Wee Herman might say. <em>And really</em>, I say, <em>I just might</em>.) I want to pinch my fingers around a tiny spot of vivid red-orange powder and dance it into eggs, onto rice, into soups, onto roasted pork. My baked kale chips have an extra surprise: smoked paprika. My roasted tofu glows red. My roasted vegetables have a smoky glow instead of a burnt char. All of this thanks to smoked paprika.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": null, "recipeCategory": ["Gluten-Free", "Gluten-Free Tuesday"], "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": []}
