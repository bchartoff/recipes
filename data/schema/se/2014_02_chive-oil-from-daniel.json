Boil the chives until tender, 2 to 3 minutes, then chill in the ice water. Squeeze dry and transfer to a blender with the grapeseed oil. Puree on high speed until very smooth and bright green. Transfer the contents to a saucepan and simmer until the liquid stops bubbling, making sure not to fry the greens. Line a fine-meshed sieve with a coffee filter and place over a dry bowl. Pour the oil into the filter and transfer to the refrigerator. Allow it to strain, undisturbed, for about 2 hours, then transfer the oil to a squeeze bottle and reserve, chilled.</p>"}]}
