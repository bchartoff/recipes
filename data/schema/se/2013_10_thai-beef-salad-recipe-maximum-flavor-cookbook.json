Stand the grapefruit up on a cutting board and pare off the skin, slicing it away from the top to the bottom, following the curve of the fruit. Once all of the pith has been removed, hold the grapefruit over a small bowl and use a paring knife to cut between the membranes and free the segments, letting them drop into the bowl. Squeeze the remaining membranes over the segments, catching the juice in the bowl. Remove the grapefruit segments from the bowl, cut them into thirds, transfer to another bowl, and set aside separately.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Add the palm sugar, rice vinegar, fish sauce, and salt to the bowl of grapefruit juice.
