Last year, I found an old <em>Bon App\u00e9tit</em> recipe that used an <strong>Asian-inspired base for the dressing:</strong> a mixture of sesame oil, honey, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar and a kick of cayenne powder. I added a little mayonnaise into the sauce as a personal preference (what's a pasta salad without a hit of mayo?), and additional vegetables on hand.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "6 to 8", "recipeCategory": ["Pasta Salad", "Salads", "Serious Heat"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fusilli or any other preferred pasta shape", "4 tablespoons sesame oil ", "3 tablespoons honey", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "1/2 cup mayonnaise ", "1 to 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper", "1 teaspoon canola oil", "3 red bell peppers, seeded, thinly sliced", "3 cups snow peas", "3 scallions, thinly sliced", "3/4 cup honey-roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.
