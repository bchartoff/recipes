It's made by cooking spicy green chilies (I use Thai bird chilies, you can use serranos or jalape\u00f1os if you prefer) along with onion, garlic, ginger, cilantro stems and red peppers. The key to great flavor development is to cook down the aromatics in oil until almost all the moisture is driven from them and they become sticky and begin to brown. To this flavorful base, a few spices are added (hot paprika, cumin, coriander, and turmeric), along with chopped tomatoes.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Dairy-Free", "Gluten-Free", "Indian", "Mains", "Vegan", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound russet potatoes, peeled and cut into rough 1 1/2-inch chunks", "Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil", " 1 medium onion, grated on the large holes of a box grater", "3 cloves of garlic, grated on a microplane grater", "1 tablespoon ginger, grated on a microplane grater", "4 to 5 small green Thai bird chilies (or other green chilies, if you prefer)", "1 small red pepper, finely diced", "8 stems cilantro, leaves roughly chopped, tender stems finely minced and reserved separately", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon hot paprika", "2 small plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and roughly chopped (a canned tomato is fine)", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, with their liquid", "8 ounces curly spinach, roughly chopped", "2 tablespoon juice from 2 limes", "&nbsp;", "<strong>For the Cilantro Chutney</strong>", "2 cups picked fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 clove garlic", "1 small green Thai bird chili"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water by 1-inch.
