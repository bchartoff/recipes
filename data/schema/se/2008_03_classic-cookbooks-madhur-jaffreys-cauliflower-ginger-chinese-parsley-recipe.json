First break the cauliflower into large florets with your hands (if the head is loosely packed) or a knife (if it is tightly packed). Since you want to end up with small florets, not longer than 1 by 1 1/2 inches and not wider at the head than 1/2 to 1 inch, she recommends taking each large floret and beginning by slicing the stems crosswise into fairly thin rounds. Keep these, as they are quite edible. When you reach the upper end of the stem, start breaking off the small florets. Slice the stem into rounds whenever it seems too long, and keep the rounds. Wash the florets and rounds of stem in a colander and leave to drain.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the ginger paste and turmeric. Fry, stirring constantly; after about 2 minutes, add green chili or cayenne and cilantro; after another 2 minutes, put in the cauliflower, continuing to cook and stir for 5 minutes. (If necessary, add 1 teaspoon warm water at a time to prevent sticking.) Now add the cumin, coriander, garam masala, lemon juice, salt, and 3 tablespoons warm water, cook and stir for about 5 minutes, then cover, lower the flame, and let cook slowly for 35-45 minutes (tightly packed cauliflower takes longer to cook), stirring gently every 10 minutes. The cauliflower is done when it is tender with just a faint trace of crispness along its inner spine.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To serve: Lift out gently and place in serving dish\u2014a low, wide bowl would be best.
