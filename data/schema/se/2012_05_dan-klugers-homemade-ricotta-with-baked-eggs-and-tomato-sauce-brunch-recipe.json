Place lid on pan and bake until eggs white are set but yolks are still runny, about 8 minutes (check every few minutes until done). Carefully remove pot from oven and sprinkle with grated cheese, torn basil leaves, and chili flakes. Season with coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drizzle with more extra-virgin olive oil, and serve.</p>"}]}
