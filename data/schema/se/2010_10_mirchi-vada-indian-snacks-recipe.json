The potatoes are enlivened with dried mango powder and dried pomegranate seeds, both of which lend a sourness that brightens it up in a way that had me sneaking forkfuls of filling straight from the bowl.  The chickpea flour batter fries up much more crisp and thick than a typical white flour, with an earthy hint of chickpea flavor.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "2 to 3", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 green chiles, long, fat, split lengthwise\u00a0", "<strong>For the stuffing:</strong> ", "2 potatoes, medium-sized, boiled, mashed", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon dried pomegranate seeds (<em>anar dana</em>)", "1 teaspoon dried mango powder (<em>amchur</em>)", "Salt to taste", "A handful of green coriander (cilantro), chopped", "1 one inch piece of ginger, grated\u00a0", "<strong>For the batter:</strong>", "1 cup gram (chickpea) flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder\u00a0", "Vegetable oil, for deep-frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the stuffing:</strong> Mix all of the ingredients together and divide the mixture into 4 portions.
