One of the big draws is the Monte Cristo, an outrageous, deep-fried, French-toast/ ham-and-cheese hybrid. Gabrielle Hamilton shares the recipe in her new cookbook, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Prune-Gabrielle-Hamilton/dp/081299409/?tag=serieats-20\"><em>Prune.</em></a> She builds the triple-decker sandwich on white bread with loads of butter, French ham, Swiss Cheese, and roasted turkey.
