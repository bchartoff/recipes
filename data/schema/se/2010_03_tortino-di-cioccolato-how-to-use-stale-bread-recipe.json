Raise the speed to medium and continue whipping until the whites form stiff, shiny peaks (if they become dry or clumpy, they're overwhipped and will not give the torte the light, smooth texture it needs; dump them and start over with new egg whites). Use a rubber spatula or whisk to fold a large scoop of the meringue into the chocolate mixture until incorporated (this will lighten it), then gently fold in the remaining meringue.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
