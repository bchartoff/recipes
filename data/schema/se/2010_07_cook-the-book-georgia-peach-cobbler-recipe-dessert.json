The peaches are peeled and sliced, and then mixed with sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, a bit of cornstarch, and then dotted with an entire stick of butter.  The topping is somewhere in between a pie crust and a biscuit, made in the stand mixer and incredibly easy to roll out.  While baking the peach juices mix with the butter and sugar, creating a liquid that seeps up over the crust and is delicious enough to eat by the spoonful.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "8 to 10", "recipeCategory": ["Bake the Book", "Cook the Book", "Desserts", "Peach", "Pies, Tarts, and Crumbles"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds fresh fruit or 1 (16-ounce) can sliced peaches in heavy syrup, undrained ", "1 cup plus 3/4 teaspoon sugar ", "1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice ", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon ", "1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg ", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract ", "2 teaspoons cornstarch ", "8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter, cut into small pieces  ", "1/2 cup shortening ", "3/4 teaspoon salt ", "1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour ", "1/3 cup ice water (with crushed ice) ", "2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, melted   "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.
