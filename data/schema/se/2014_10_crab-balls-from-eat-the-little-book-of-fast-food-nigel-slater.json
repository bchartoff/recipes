The crab cakes only require throwing a hot chili pepper, a garlic clove, a bit of bread, and a lot of cilantro into a food processor, then combining the mixture with lump crabmeat and mirin. Formed into little balls and pan-fried, they're crisp, crabby, and terrifically aromatic.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 3 to 4", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Lobster and Crab", "Mains"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 hot red chili", "1 garlic clove", "3 1/2 ounces soft white bread", "1 large bunch cilantro (about 2/3 ounce, including both the leaves and the thinner stalks)", "2 tablespoons mirin", "14 ounces lump crabmeat", "Salt and black pepper", "Sunflower or peanut oil, for frying", "Lime halves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Put <strong>a hot red chili,</strong> including the seeds, into a food processor with <strong>a garlic clove, 3 1/2 ounces (100g) soft white bread,</strong> and <strong>a large bunch of cilantro</strong> (about 2/3 ounce / 20g, including both the leaves and the thinner stalks).
