Usually, this meant tuna served in the style of <em>tataki</em>, a traditional Japanese preparation in which the bulk of the tuna is essentially cold and raw. With the precise control of a sous vide cooker, you have a few more options. Rather than cold and raw in the center, you can serve tuna that's heated just to the point of starting to firm up, giving it an even meatier bite while maintaining a gorgeous, translucent deep red color and moist texture.", "totalTime": "1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes (depending on size of steaks), or up to overnight", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Easter", "Fish", "Gluten-Free", "Mains", "Sous Vide", "The Food Lab"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 (10- to 12-ounce) tuna steaks (about 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick; 280 to 320g each) (see note)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil", "Aromatics such as fresh thyme, dill, parsley, thinly sliced shallots, and/or citrus zest (optional)", "1/2 cup (60g) black or white sesame seeds (optional; for searing)", "2 teaspoons (10ml) vegetable oil, if serving seared"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Season tuna generously with salt and pepper on all sides.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place tuna in a single layer in a gallon-size zipper-lock bag, or in 2 individual quart-size bags.
