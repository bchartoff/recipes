Add the remaining truffle butter, and once it has melted, add the eggs. Allow it to cook for at least 20 seconds. Only then, drag a silicone spatula from the edges of the pan, to the center, moving the cooked egg from the bottom in big clumps, and making room for the uncooked egg to settle on the bottom of the pan.  Do this a few more times, until the eggs are just set. They will cook for a total of about 2 minutes. Serve right away.</p>"}]}
