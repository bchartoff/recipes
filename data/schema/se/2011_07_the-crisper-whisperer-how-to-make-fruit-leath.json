Berries, cherries, stone fruits, apples, and pears&mdash;they all work beautifully. Choose ripe or very ripe fruit, and remove any blemishes. Seasonings are where you can really get creative. A little vanilla with berries perhaps? You can add liquors, chopped nuts, you name it. <strong>Your leather is as nimble as your imagination.</strong> (That sounds wrong for so many reasons, I know&mdash;but it's right.)", "totalTime": "2 to 8 hours", "recipeYield": "8", "recipeCategory": ["Crisper Whisperer", "Fruit Desserts", "Snacks", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups washed, pitted, chopped fruit", "2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup, optional", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "A pinch of the spice(s) of your choice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven as low as it goes (usually 150&deg;F or 200&deg;F &mdash; anything up to  200&deg;F is fine) with a rack in the middle.
