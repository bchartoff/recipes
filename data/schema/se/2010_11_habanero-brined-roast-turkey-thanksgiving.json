Wearing gloves, take turkey out of brine, discard brine, and pat dry. Place reserved giblets in the bottom of roasting pan, and place the turkey, breast-up on top of giblets. Place onion in bowl. Cut habaneros nearly in quarters, keeping stem end attached, and add to onions. In a small pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter, and pour over the onion and habaneros. Wearing gloves, toss mixture gently with your hands. Place inside turkey cavity. Rub the remaining butter all over the outside of turkey, and sprinkle with pepper. Tie drumsticks together with kitchen twine, and tuck wingtips up and under wings. Cover turkey breast with buttered sheet of aluminum foil, and place in oven. Roast for 50 minutes. Meanwhile, heat broth to just a simmer, and keep warm. After 50 minutes, remove foil from breast, and baste with 1/2 cup of warmed broth. Continue to cook, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes, until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh reads about 165\u00b0. Baste with remaining 1/4 cup broth if the pan becomes too dry. The turkey should need 2 1/2 to 3 hours total cooking time. If legs become too brown, cover them with foil while continuing to cook. Remove from oven, and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes. Carve, and serve.</p>"}]}
