Off heat, add the chopped chocolate and vanilla, and whisk until smooth.

It will still be runny but thick enough to fall from the whisk in thin ribbons, about 5 minutes.

When allowed to run off the whisk and into the bowl, the mixture should be able to briefly mound up on itself before leveling off. Please bear in mind all times are ballpark figures only and may vary considerably depending on the power and capacity of a given stand mixer, along with factors such as bowl-to-beater clearance (more on that <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/07/stand-mixer-running-slow-you-may-need-to-adjust-its-bowl-height.html\">here</a>).

Grasping the attachment by its top, give the batter a few strokes of the whisk by hand to finish incorporating the flour. Fold the batter once or twice from the bottom up with a flexible spatula, then scrape into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer with an offset spatula.
