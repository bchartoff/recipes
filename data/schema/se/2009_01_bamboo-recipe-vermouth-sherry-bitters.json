The <strong>Bamboo</strong> dates to at least the early 20th century, and unlike most cocktails you come across, it has a more modest payload, being based on <strong>equal parts dry vermouth and dry sherry</strong> (I like the bone-dry crispness of manzanilla in mine, though you could explore the range of dry sherries with this drink; an oloroso or amontillado could have interesting results).", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "makes 1 cocktail", "recipeCategory": ["Liqueur and Fortified Wines"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces dry vermouth", "1 1/2 ounces dry sherry", "1-2 dashes bitters (I prefer Angostura Orange or Regan\u2019s Orange bitters)", "Orange twist, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine vermouth, sherry, and bitters in a mixing glass and fill with ice.
