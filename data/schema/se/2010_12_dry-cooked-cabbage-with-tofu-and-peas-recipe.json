I mean, it's just a bunch of cabbage and tofu. While I worried this recipe from <em><a href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Dry-Cooked-Cabbage-with-Tofu-and-Peas\">Saveur</a></em> would be too light and insubstantial, <strong>I was hooked by the use of ginger, mustard, and coriander.</strong> It was too alluring to ignore. Good thing, too. <strong>Something strange happens to the tofu.</strong> After a thin coating of flour, it's pan-fried until golden. When mixed with the cooked cabbage, it takes on an almost potato-like flavor, which helps balance the aggressive spices and serranos.
