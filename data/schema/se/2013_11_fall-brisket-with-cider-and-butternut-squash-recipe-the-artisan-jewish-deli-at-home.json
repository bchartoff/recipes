Pat the brisket dry with paper towels and season it generously with salt and pepper. Select a Dutch oven or stainless-steel roasting pan that will be large enough to accommodate the brisket, vegetables, and braising liquid. Heat the pan over medium-high heat, and then add the oil.

Continue cooking until the squash and onions are tender when pierced with a fork and the meat is very tender and easily shreds, 30 to 45 minutes longer. To test the brisket for doneness, use two forks to gently pull the meat apart in the center. If it is still a bit tough but the squash and onions are done, transfer the vegetables to an ovenproof dish using a slotted spoon; set them aside, covered with aluminum foil to keep warm. Continue to braise the brisket for about 15 minutes more, and then retest. The internal temperature should be 195\u00b0F for lean brisket, or 205\u00b0F if it is a fattier brisket.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>When the brisket is done, transfer it to a cutting board, fat side up, while you finish the sauce.
