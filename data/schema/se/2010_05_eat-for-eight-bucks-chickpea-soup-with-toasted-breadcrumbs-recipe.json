If you've cooked your chickpeas carefully and stored them in their broth, <strong>not much can go wrong</strong> with this soup. It's very receptive to experimentation with spices, herbs, and greens. The escarole, my addition, brought some nice flavor and texture to the dish.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Eat for Eight Bucks", "Legumes", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["About 3/4 cup homemade bread crumbs", "Olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "1 teaspoon pimenton or cumin (optional)", "Salt and pepper", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "Splash of wine (optional)", "3 cups cooked chickpeas, with about 2 cups of their cooking liquid", "1 head escarole, cleaned and chopped into bite-size pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.

Stir in the pimenton or cumin, if using, along with some salt and pepper and the garlic and cook for about a minute more.
