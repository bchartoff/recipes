Sometimes there are a few grapefruits tucked into plates, but it is mostly a sweet, decadent affair. After making <a href=\"http://www.food52.com/users/19827_localsavour\">LocalSavour's</a> <strong>Warm Custard Spoon Bread</strong> from the new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Food52-Cookbook-Volume-Seasonal/dp/0061887293/?tag=serieats-20\">Food52 Cookbook</a>, I may make a case for changing up the main course. This spoon bread won the \"Best Holiday Breakfast\" contest, and with very good reason--this bread is magic. Somehow, the process of whisking together a loose cornbread batter, pouring it into a hot pan, and topping it off with a generous pour of heavy cream yields a three layer masterpiece made of custard, cake, and cornbread. Surely there must be some baking science behind it, but I'm content to leave that to the experts. Magic spoon bread is just fine by me.", "totalTime": "1 hour and 15 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 6 to 8", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Cook the Book", "Eggs"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup stone-ground cornmeal", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon sea salt", "2 large eggs", "2 cups milk", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons unsalted butter, melted", "1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 cup heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F.
