The custard should be set a bit around the edges and jiggly in the center. If they are not done, return them to the oven with the foil over them and check frequently.

Circle the outer edge at that level until the melted sugar begins to darken. Move the torch towards the center, which will smoke and even catch on fire. Finish by touching up light areas with the torch. Serve immediately.</p>"}]}
