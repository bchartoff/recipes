Usually you saut\u00e9 some vegetables, cook the potatoes in stock until tender, then lightly mash them up at the end to thicken the soup. But this one from <em><a href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Potato-Soup\">Saveur</a></em> insists on simply tossing the vegetables, including the onions, into a pot and simmering until tender. Nothing is sauteed first, and the only thickening agent is a basic cheese sauce added at the very end.", "totalTime": "1 hour", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 people", "recipeCategory": ["Cheese", "Dinner Tonight", "Potato", "Soups and Stews"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 russet potatoes, peeled and diced", "1 carrot, peeled and sliced", "1 yellow onion, chopped", "6 cups chicken stock ", "8 tablespoons butter ", "\u00bc cup flour ", "2 cups milk ", "2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, grated ", "Salt and pepper "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Add the potatoes carrots, onions, and chicken stock to a large, heavy pot.
