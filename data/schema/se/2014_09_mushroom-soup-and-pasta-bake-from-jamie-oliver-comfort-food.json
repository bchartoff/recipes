Pour over half the soup (eat the rest or save for another day), gently mix together, then tip into a baking dish (8 x 12 inches) and top with an extra grating of Cheddar. To make it extra special, use a mandolin (use the guard!) to shave the mushrooms and garlic into a bowl, strip in the thyme leaves, then toss it all in a drizzle of oil and scatter over the pasta. Bake for around 30 minutes, or until golden and starting to crisp up at the edges. Yum.</p>"}]}
