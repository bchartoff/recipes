I used the basic frittata recipe from <strong>Mark Bittman</strong>'s <em>How to Cook Everything</em>, replaced most of the eggs with egg whites, plugged it full of mushrooms and onions, reduced the Parmesan, and made the bacon a flavoring agent, rather than the focus of the dish. These four actions cut the fat and calories significantly, yet the frittata remained dang tasty. In fact, after we each had one piece, my husband went back and polished off another.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Healthy and Delicious", "Mushrooms"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 slices bacon", "1/2 cup chopped onion", "1 1/2 cups chopped or sliced button mushrooms", "2 eggs", "6 egg whites", "Kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup grated parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a medium oven-proof skillet, cook bacon over medium-high heat until crispy.
