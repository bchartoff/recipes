Secondly, you've got to heat their surface in order to dehydrate and crisp them. Finally, you have to maximize the surface area, giving the potatoes more places to crisp up.", "totalTime": "20 minutes", "recipeYield": "4, as a side", "recipeCategory": ["Christmas", "Duck", "Potato", "Sides", "Thanksgiving"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes, scrubbed clean", "Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons duck fat (see note)", "Coarse sea salt, like Maldon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Cover potatoes with cold water in a saucepan.
