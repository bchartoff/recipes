In my house, the essential ingredients are green peppers, celery, onion, okra, rice, tomato and some sort of pork; but feel free to experiment and create your own list of essentials.  If fresh okra is not in season use frozen cut okra, but be sure to use a brand you trust&mdash;some frozen okra can be distastefully fibrous. As always, homemade stock is best, but a grocery store version always works in a pinch.  Coleslaw is a great side with this dinner, as is cold beer.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Mains", "Pork", "Shrimp", "Sunday Supper"], "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound sausage (andouille, or any hot pork sausage), casing removed", "1 onion, finely chopped", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "1 stalk celery, minced", "1 green pepper, finely chopped", "1 cup white rice", "1 can (14.5 ounce) diced tomatoes", "2 cups chicken stock", "1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika (omit if using a smoked sausage)", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cup okra, cut into 1 inch pieces", "1/3 -1/2 pound peeled and deveined shrimp"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat skillet over medium high heat and add sausage, breaking it into small pieces with a wooden spoon.
