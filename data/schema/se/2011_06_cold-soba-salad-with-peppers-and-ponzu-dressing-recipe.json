At its worst, the soba comes out gummy and water-logged. The key is to start with a very simple dish like this one. The soba is boiled, drained in a colander, then rinsed under cold water. Just make sure to let it drain again after the rinse&mdash;this solved most of my issues. Some sauteed shrimp or tofu would help bulk this out if you were really hungry, but it's absolutely perfect for those in need of a light summer meal.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "4 people", "recipeCategory": ["Dinner Tonight", "Japanese", "Noodles"], "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces soba ", "4 tablespoons ponzu", "4 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce", "Juice of 2 limes", "\u00bd teaspoon honey", "\u00bd red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, diced ", "\u00bd orange bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, diced ", "4 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced ", "1 teaspoon sesame seeds", "togarashi (optional) "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Bring two quarts of water to a boil in a large pot.
