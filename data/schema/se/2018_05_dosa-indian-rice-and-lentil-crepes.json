(If your griddle is well seasoned, then no cooking oil will be necessary; if it's not, add 1 teaspoon/5ml neutral oil to the griddle once it's preheated.) Using a 1/4-cup measure or 2-ounce ladle, pour batter onto center of griddle. Using the bottom of the measuring cup or ladle, spread batter, using circular motions, until it thinly covers the entire griddle bottom. Cook until the surface of the dosa is just set, about 1 minute. Brush or drizzle with 1 tablespoon (15ml) melted ghee. Continue cooking until bottom of dosa is golden brown and edges are crisp, about 4 minutes longer. Serve right away. Repeat with remaining batter until all dosa are cooked. "}]}
