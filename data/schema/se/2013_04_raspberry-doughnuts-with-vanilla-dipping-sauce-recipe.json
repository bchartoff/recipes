The temperature range for the \u201cwarm\u201d water is where the dry yeast likes to wake up from its nap in those little envelopes in the back of your cupboard. (When you run the water from the tap, it\u2019s about where water starts to feel just hot to the touch; if it is so hot that you have to pull your hand away, you\u2019ve gone much too far.) Whisk in the yeast and set aside to dissolve in the water. After 10 minutes, you should see a few small bubbles on the surface. (If there is nothing at all, start again with fresher yeast.) Stir in the all-purpose flour, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place.<br />\n</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugar on medium speed until fluffy and light, 8 to 10 minutes. Do not skimp on or rush this time. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as you mix. With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, one by one, taking care that each one is thoroughly integrated before adding the next. When the mix is smooth, add the vanilla and salt. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the bread flour and mix on low speed until fully incorporated. Add the yeast mixture and mix again until thoroughly incorporated.

Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to about a 1-inch thickness. Cut rounds of dough with a 2-inch round cookie cutter. You cannot reroll scraps (though you can fry them as is and devour them in the kitchen), so cut your doughnut rounds very close together to maximize yield. Put the doughnuts, leaving room between them for them to grow, on a floured baking sheet to rest in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes. If you wait longer than that to fry them and they become fairly puffed up, cover them with plastic and refrigerate until you are ready.
