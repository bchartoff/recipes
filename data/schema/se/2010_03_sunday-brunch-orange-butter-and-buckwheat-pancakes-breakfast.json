Since this has everything to do with <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=278870658190\">Almanzo Wilder</a> (of the <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> series) and nothing to do with a specific taste memory from my own life, perhaps it's unsurprising that the goal has proven elusive. But this recipe from <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Arthur-Flour-Whole-Grain-Baking/dp/0881507199/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1268425620&amp;sr=8-1\">King Arthur Flour Whole Grain Baking</a> </em>has been the tastiest of the lot so far, and I loved the orange butter they suggested as an accompaniment.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCategory": ["Pancake"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "1 tablespoon packed brown sugar", "Zest of 1/2 orange", "1 tablespoon orange juice (optional)", "1 cup (4 1/4 ounces) whole buckwheat flour", "3/4 cup (3 1/8 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 egg", "2 tablespoons molasses", "2 cups buttermilk", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<h4>Buckwheat Pancakes</h4>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Whisk the dry ingredients to combine in a medium bowl.

If the surface is not nonstick, brush it lightly with vegetable oil. When the griddle is hot, spoon batter on in 1/4-cup dollops. Cook until bubbles begin to form around the edges, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary to keep pancakes from scorching or cooking too slowly. When the cakes are just beginning to set, flip to finish cooking on the second side, about 1 minute more. I found that they tended to stay raw and needed a little extra cooking to suit my taste.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Serve immediately with orange butter.</p>"}]}
