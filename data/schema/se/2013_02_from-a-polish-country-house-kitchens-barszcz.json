Barszcz is seen in many iterations throughout Poland, Russia, and Ukraine; sometimes it is thick with pieces of beet and shreds of beef, sometimes the soup blushes with sour cream, and other times it it served crystal clear. The traditional Polish version in <a href=\"http://www.anneapplebaum.com/\">Anne Applebaum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.daniellecrittenden.com/\">Danielle Crittenden's</a> <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/From-Polish-Country-House-Kitchen/dp/1452110557/?tag=serieats-20\">From A Polish Country House Kitchen</a></em> is that of the third type. After simmering a multitudinous concoction of beets, carrots, celery root, leeks, onions, garlic, and beef bones in several cups of water until rich in color and deep in earthy flavor, the entire contents of the pot are strained out. The soup is then served simply with a squeeze of lemon and a dollop of sour cream.", "totalTime": "2 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 6 to 8 as an appetizer, or 4 to 6 as a main course", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Cook the Book", "Mains", "Sides", "Soups and Stews"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 large or 6 small beets, peeled and halved", "1 lb (455 g) meaty veal or beef bones", "1 medium carrot, trimmed and peeled", "1 medium parsnip, trimmed and peeled", "1 large onion, peeled and halved", "1 leek (white and green parts), trimmed, halved lengthwise, and rinsed", "1/4 celery root, peeled, or 1 long celery stalk", "3 to 4 dried mushrooms or porcini, if you\u2019ve got them", "8 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole, plus 2 extra just in case", "1 bay leaf", "1 large pinch of dried marjoram, plus more for seasoning", "6 peppercorns (optional; throw them in if you like a spicier soup)", "About 12 cups (2.8 L) water (depending on the size of the pot)", "Juice of 1 lemon", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1/2 cup (120 ml) sour cream or plain Greek-style yogurt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine the beets, bones, carrot, parsnip, onion, leek, celery root, mushrooms, 8 garlic cloves, the bay leaf, marjoram, peppercorns (if using), and water in a large stockpot and bring to a boil.
