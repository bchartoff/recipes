Though a great steak often needs little more than a nice sear and some salt and pepper, when you stuff that steak between two slices of bread, something strange happens. The meat often ends up both bland and tough, which is puzzling. In <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1298925956/?tag=serieats-20\">Simple Italian Snacks,</a></em> Jason Denton and Kathryn Kellinger</strong> get past this by cooking a flank steak until medium-rare, then slicing it thinly against the grain. It also helps that it's topped with an herby goat cheese and caramelized onions.
