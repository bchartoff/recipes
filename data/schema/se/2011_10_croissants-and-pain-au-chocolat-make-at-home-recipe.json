To make them, you create a yeasted dough, into which you secure a sheet of butter. The flaky layers in the end product are the result of folding the dough many times, a process called lamination. From mixing and proofing, to laminating and resting and shaping, croissants are certainly not a quickie project, but with practice, the results can be amazing.", "totalTime": "2 days", "recipeYield": "Makes 12 Croissants", "recipeCategory": ["Chocolate", "Desserts", "Pastry"], "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup (4 ounces) hot water", "1 cup (8 ounce) whole milk", "1 tablespoon instant or rapidrise yeast", "3/4 cup sugar", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "17.5 ounces (3 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour", "13 ounces cold butter", "1 egg, thoroughly beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Make the dough: </strong>Combine the milk, water, and yeast in a bowl and stir.

Turn the dough 90 degrees so the line where the two flaps meet is vertical. Carefully roll the dough out into a large rectangle.

The point should end up tucked under the croissant. Bring the two ends together to form a crescent shape. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining croissants, leaving 3 inches of space between each croissant (you will need two trays total).
