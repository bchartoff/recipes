Add 1 more tablespoon (15ml) reserved oil to skillet and return to heat. Carefully slide tortilla back into skillet and continue to cook until second side is beginning to firm up, about 2 minutes. Use rubber spatula to again press the sides in all around to form a rounded puck shape. Continue to cook tortilla until lightly browned on second side but still tender in the center when pressed with a finger, about 2 minutes longer. If desired, you can flip tortilla 2 to 3 more times during these last minutes of cooking, which helps to cook the center more evenly and reinforce the shape.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Carefully slide tortilla out of skillet onto a clean plate (or invert it onto a clean plate using same method as before) and let stand at least 5 minutes before serving with <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/01/two-minute-foolproof-aioli-recipe.html\">allioli</a>. Tortilla can be cut into wedges for a larger meal or into cubes for an hors d'oeuvre&ndash;sized snack. It is just as good, if not better, at room temperature. Leftover tortilla can be refrigerated up to 3 days; allow to return to room temperature before serving. Remaining frying oil can be used in other dishes; it has an excellent flavor thanks to the long cooking with potato and onion.</p>"}]}
