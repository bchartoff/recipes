One of my previous loaves used a darker roasted malt called Pearl Black that smelled very much like roasted coffee and had a much stronger flavor in the finished loaf. If you don't have dark malted barley, <strong>you could simply leave it out and use this recipe to make a standard rye.</strong> It will be a lot paler, and not as complex, but still a nice loaf of rye.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCategory": ["Bread", "Bread Baking"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup lukewarm water", "2 1/2 teaspoons yeast", "1 tablespoon pale chocolate barley malt", "1/2 cup dark rye flour", "1/2 cup rye flakes", "2 tablespoons sugar", "2 cups bread flour", "2 teaspoons salt", "1/4 cup Greek-style yogurt", "1 tablespoon olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In the bowl of your stand mixer, combine water, yeast, barley malt, rye flour, rye flakes, and sugar.
