Delicious but messy. The simplest way is to place a rack on top of the baking sheet lined with parchment paper and then place the cream-bo right on top of that rack. When you pour the ganache over the cream-bo, the ganache will drip past the cooling rack and onto the parchment paper. The ganache should harden almost on contact with the frozen cream-bo, creating a nice chocolate shell. Use a spatula to lift the cookies from the cooling rack and onto a serving platter. Crumple up the parchment paper for an easy cleanup so you can have more time to enjoy these gooey treats.</p>"}]}
