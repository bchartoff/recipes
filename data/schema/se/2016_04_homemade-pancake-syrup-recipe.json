With just a touch of butter, it's perfect for drizzling over pancakes, waffles, and French toast, too.", "totalTime": "20 minutes", "recipeYield": "Makes about 1 cup (12 ounces)", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Breakfast Sweets", "Mother's Day"], "recipeIngredient": ["5 ounces water (1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons; 140g)", "9 ounces granulated sugar (1 1/4 cup; 250g)", "1 3/4 ounce light brown sugar (3 tablespoons; 50g) or 1/2 ounce dark brown sugar (1 tablespoon; 14g) (see note)", "3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight", "1/4 teaspoon (1g) cream of tartar", "Scant 1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "2 ounces water (1/4 cup; 55g) ", "1/4 ounce unsalted butter (1/2 tablespoon; 7g)", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine water, sugar, brown sugar, salt, and cream of tartar in a 1-quart stainless steel pot.
