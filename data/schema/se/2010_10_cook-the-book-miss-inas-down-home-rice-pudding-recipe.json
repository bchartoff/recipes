About 10 minutes into cooking the pot starts to steam and give off an intoxicating mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, and butter aromas&mdash;warm, sweet, and totally amazing.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Desserts", "Puddings and Custards", "Rice"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups rice", "3 cups water", "1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg ", "1/2 cup evaporated milk", "3/4 cup brown or granulated sugar "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine all the ingredients in the rice cooker.
