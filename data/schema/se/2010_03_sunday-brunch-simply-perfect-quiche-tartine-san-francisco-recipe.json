The incorporation of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche makes the custard irresistibly tastier and fluffier, almost like a savory dessert. Keeping the flavoring to thyme, salt, and pepper allows you really to appreciate the eggs and crust. You can, of course, use any unsweetened pastry crust to make quiche, but I thought this generous recipe worked particularly well.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "6 to 8", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Eggs", "Quiche"], "recipeIngredient": ["Fully baked and cooled tart shell baked in a 10-inch ceramic quiche dish, deep 10-inch tart pan, or 10-inch pie pan", "5 large eggs", "3 tablespoons flour", "1 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 cup whole milk", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon salt", "2/3 cup water, very cold", "3 cups + 2 tablespoons (1 pound) all-purpose flour ", "1 cup + 5 tablespoons (10 1/2 ounces) unsalted butter, very cold"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Have the pie shell ready for filling.
