To make neat, well-shaped cookies, as you finish piping each round, sweep the pastry tip horizontally off to the side with a slight curving motion.  (The cookies should cover 2 to 3 standard baking sheets.  Batter will hold for a while after it is piped, so trays can be baked one or two at a time, as your oven allows.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Bake at 350\u00b0F for about 15-20 minutes, until cookies are lightly browned, rotating trays every 5 minutes or so for even coloring.
