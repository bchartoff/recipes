Since this is a vegetarian version of puttanesca&mdash;it doesn't have the nutty base of anchovies melted into olive oil&mdash;the cauliflower plays the replacement role. At the beginning, high heat is your friend. Once that flavor is built into the dish, the rest is easy and comes together in no time.", "totalTime": "25 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Dinner Tonight", "Pasta", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound penne or other short pasta", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 small head cauliflower (about 1 1/2 pounds), broken into small florets", "salt and pepper to taste", "2 cloves garlic, chopped", "1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed", "1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, chopped", "2 tablespoons capers, rinsed", "1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley", "Grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
