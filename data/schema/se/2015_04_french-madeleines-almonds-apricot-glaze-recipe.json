They're often flavored with vanilla bean or citrus, such as lemon or orange, but in this recipe, the buttery flavor of the madeleines is paired with the slightly bitter taste of almond extract and a sweet apricot glaze. Vanilla is added for a touch of warmth, while the brown butter in the batter gives the madeleines a rich, complex flavor.", "totalTime": "1 hour 40 minutes", "recipeYield": "Makes 16 madeleines", "recipeCategory": ["Apricot", "Cakes", "Desserts", "Father's Day", "Mother's Day", "Nuts", "Valentine's Day"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Madeleines:</strong>", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon (3.17 ounces or 90 grams) unsalted butter, cubed, plus more for greasing", "2 large eggs", "1/2 cup (3.5 ounces or 100 grams) granulated sugar", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon (3.17 ounces or 90 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1 1/2 tablespoons milk", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "2 tablespoons shaved almonds", "<strong>For the Glaze:</strong>", "3 tablespoons apricot jam", "1 tablespoon water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Madeleines:</strong> Heat the butter in a heavy-bottomed and preferably light-colored saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until melted.
