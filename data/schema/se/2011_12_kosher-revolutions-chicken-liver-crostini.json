To do so, remove any fat from the livers. Rinse them three times under running water and salt lightly with kosher salt. Transfer the livers to a rack that, when fitted in a roasting pan, will allow juices to run away from it<br />\r\ninto the pan. Broil the livers until well done, about 5 minutes per side. Cut open a liver to ensure that no pink remains, and broil longer, if necessary. Rinse the livers three times and dry thoroughly.</p>"}]}
