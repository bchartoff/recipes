Fit the mixer with the whisk attachment and whisk continuously on high until the mixture has completely cooled (note: the custard must be absolutely, completely cool before you add the butter. If you have extra time you can always place a piece of plastic wrap on top of the custard and refrigerate it until it is completely chilled). Once the custard is cooled, put the mixer on high and add the butter one tablespoon at a time. Add the cream cheese one tablespoon at a time until it is well combined and the texture of the frosting is light and fluffy. Beat in the lemon juice until fully incorporated. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Frost cake adding a thin layer of frosting between the layers to leave enough to cover the top and sides of the cake completely.
