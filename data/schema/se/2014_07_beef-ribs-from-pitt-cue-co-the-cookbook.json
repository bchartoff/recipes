Unlike the pork rib membrane, which is fresh and thin, the membrane on the underside of the beef rib is thick and a bit of a pain. To remove it, score down each side of the individual bones, being careful not to cut into the flesh. Get a proper butcher\u2019s knife with some flexibility and work up the rib, removing the membrane with as little flesh as possible. Try to keep the knife as flat as you can to the flesh, just skinning the membrane from it. The removed membrane should be about\u2028 3/4 inch wide and run the entire length of each rib. All that will remain is a small section of membrane on the rib bone itself, which is a fair compromise. <br />\r\n</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Cover the rack all over with the rub.
