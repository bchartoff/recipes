Frankly, I never liked this version of the quick bread, much preferring to eat \"real bread\" with my soup. It's a good thing I was mistaken about the scope of soda breads. Most of these loaves, like those featured in <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rachels-Irish-Family-Food-classic/dp/0007462581/?tag=serieats-20\">Rachel's Irish Family Food</a></em>, are a much simpler (and more appealing) combination of flour, baking soda, and buttermilk. <strong><a href=\"http://www.rachelallen.co.uk/biog.html\">Rachel Allen's</a></strong> brown soda bread adds a bit more oomph with a hefty dose of whole wheat flour, a couple tablespoons of mixed seeds, and just a touch of butter. The resulting bread is an exemplary accompaniment to any number of soups, pickles, marmalades, or a generous swipe of butter.", "totalTime": "55 minutes", "recipeYield": "makes 1 loaf", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Quick Bread", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups (225g) whole wheat (wholemeal) flour ", "1 3/4 cups (225g) all-purpose (plain) flour ", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)", "3 tablespoons (50g) mixed seeds, such as sesame, pumpkin, or sunflower, or golden flax seeds (linseeds) (optional)", "2 tablespoons (25g) butter, softened (optional)", "1 egg", "About 1 2/3 cups (375\u2013400ml) buttermilk or soured milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Sift together the flours, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl and mix in the seeds (if using).
