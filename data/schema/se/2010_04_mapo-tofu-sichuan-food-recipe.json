It's feisty and slightly out of control, and yet it still feels homey and relaxed. Sure, <strong>the chili bean paste adds a wallop of heat,</strong> and the Sichuan peppercorns numb the inside of your mouth, but it's not overly greasy or heavy. It's meaty, but as much of the umami punch comes form the fermented black beans as the ground pork. This recipe comes from <strong><a href=\"http://www.fuchsiadunlop.com/\">Fuchsia Dunlop</a></strong>'s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393051773/?tag=serieats-20\">Land of Plenty</a></em>, and she really hit the necessary balance here.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCategory": ["Chinese", "Dinner Tonight", "Pork", "Tofu", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound soft tofu, drained and cut into 1 inch cubes", "3 tablespoons peanut oil", "6 ounces ground pork", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 leeks, thinly sliced, thick green parts discarded", "2 1/2 tablespoons chili bean paste", "1 tablespoon fermented black beans", "2 teaspoons Sichuan pepper, ground", "1 cup chicken stock", "2 teaspoons white sugar", "2 teaspoons light soy sauce", "2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons cold water", "1 tablespoon scallions, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pour the oil into a large work set over high heat.
