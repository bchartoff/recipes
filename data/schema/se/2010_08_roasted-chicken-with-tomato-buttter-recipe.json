In fact, I've made it a personal mission to convert the anchovy-opposed into fans of the oily little fishes.  My preferred method of easing newcomers into the umami-rich world of anchovies is something I like to call \"the secret anchovy\"&mdash;dissolving a few filets into a dish to deepen the flavor.

Whisk 2 egg yolks and 1tablespoon water together in a bowl. Whisk the yolks and tomato paste into sherry. Cook over low heat, whisking continuously so the yolks don\u2019t \u201cscramble\u201d. Add butter 1 piece at a time, whisking until it has melted before adding the next. If the sauce separates, remove from heat and whisk in another piece of cold butter. It should come back together.
