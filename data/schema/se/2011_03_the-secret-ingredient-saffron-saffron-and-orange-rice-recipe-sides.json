It works so well together, the aromatic bitterness of saffron with the bright sweetness of orange.  This is a very simple rice, based on my favorite yellow rice that I get in Spanish and Mexican restaurants, that is glammed up with some ritzy ingredients.  I toast orzo and shallots and add white rice, and then cook it with saffron-infused stock for color and a deep, heady flavor.  Stud it with toasted pine nuts and orange zest at the last minute, and you have a simple-to-make side that is elegant and impressive.  I would serve this with roasted bone-in chicken, or jumbo shell-on prawns.", "totalTime": "25 minutes", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Rice", "Sides", "The Secret Ingredient"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup water", "1 cup low-sodium organic chicken stock", "1/2 teaspoon saffron", "2 teaspoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup orzo", "1 shallot, finely diced", "Kosher salt", "1 cup parboiled rice", "2 teaspoons zest from 1/4 orange", "3 tablespoons toasted pine nuts", "Freshly cracked black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a medium saucepot, heat the water and stock with the saffron over medium heat.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a large saucepot, melt the butter over medium heat.
