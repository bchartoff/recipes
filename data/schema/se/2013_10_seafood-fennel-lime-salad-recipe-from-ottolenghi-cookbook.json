Sure, you'll see ceviche on every other \"Latin-inspired\" menu, but other than this raw preparation, chilled seafood lovers are often left salad-less.

To brighten it up, they add a generous squeeze of time, a flurry of its zest, and a spoonful of citrusy sumac. Dill, cilantro, and parsley give the salad an herbaceous finish.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Cook the Book", "Gluten-Free", "Lime", "Other Seafood", "Salads", "Shrimp", "Sides"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 small fennel bulbs", "1/2 red onion, very thinly sliced", "Grated zest and juice of 1 lime", "2 cloves garlic, crushed", "2 tablespoons chopped dill", "2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1 mild chile, seeded and finely chopped", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "8 tiger prawns", "12 ounces (350 g) cleaned baby squid", "1 tablespoon sumac", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro", "Coarse sea salt", "Pomegranate seeds, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Trim the bases and tops of the fennel bulbs, then slice crosswise as thinly as you can.
