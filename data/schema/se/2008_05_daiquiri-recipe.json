Of course, \"well made\" is a big factor here, as well: to fully realize the daiquiri's inherent beauty, be sure to measure your ingredients; free-pouring, while easier and cooler-looking than eyeballing a measuring cup, frequently leaves you with an odd-tasting drink. And while you can mix the daiquiri with different rums or in one of its fruit-enhanced variations, the use of fresh lime juice is absolutely essential; those little green plastic limes and day-glo bottles of Rose's should stay as far from your daiquiri as possible.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "makes 1 cocktail", "recipeCategory": ["Rum"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces light rum (you can also use gold rum, but dark rum can be too heavy)", "3/4 ounce fresh-squeezed lime juice (about 1/2 of a lime)", "1 teaspoon sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pour sugar and lime juice into a cocktail shaker and stir until sugar is dissolved.
