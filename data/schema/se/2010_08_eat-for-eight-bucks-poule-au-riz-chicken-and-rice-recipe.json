In the top of a double boiler (or a bowl set over a pot of simmering water), whisk together the egg yolk and white wine vinegar. Gradually add 2/3 cup chicken stock, whisking all the while.

Toss the remaining lettuce and coarsely chopped parsley leaves with a simple vinaigrette for your salad.</p>"}]}
