After whipping, the ganache will firm as it sits (and even more after it is chilled), so spread it immediately. If you accidentally overwhip, or if the ganache becomes too stiff to spread, warm your spatula by rinsing it under hot tap water and wiping it dry as necessary.

High-percentage chocolates are superb here, but the ratio of chocolate to cream must be decreased, or the ganache will be too dense. To use a higher-percentage chocolate, adjust the recipe as follows. (At each level the flavor is less sweet but the texture is still light.)</p>\n\n<p>To use 60% to 64% chocolate: Use 7 ounces (200 grams) chocolate and increase the cream to 2\u00bc cups.</p>\n\n<p>To use 66% to 72% chocolate: Use 6 ounces (170 grams) chocolate, increase the cream to 2 1/4 cups, and add at least 4 teaspoons (17 grams), or up to 3 tablespoons (38 grams), sugar to the cream before heating it. Alter the technique slightly: pour half of the hot cream and sugar over the chocolate first and stir until smooth before adding the rest. (Without added sugar, the flavor of the ganache is a bit flat. The minimal 4 teaspoons sugar lifts and opens up the flavor\u2014the way salt lifts the flavor of savory food\u2014without adding perceptible sweetness. You can taste and adjust the sugar before chilling the ganache.)<br />\n</p>"}]}
