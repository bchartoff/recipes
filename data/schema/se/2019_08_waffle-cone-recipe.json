Close the iron firmly and cook until the wafer is uniformly golden brown, about 85 seconds. The exact cooking time and temperature will vary drastically from machine to machine; the idea is to find a setting and time that will cook the wafer at a gentle pace, helping drive out moisture without browning too fast. When cooked too fast, the wafer will be brittle and difficult to shape. When cooked too slow, the wafer will be pale, and may not crisp fully once cool."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<strong>Troubleshooting: </strong> If the wafer seems splotchy or pale, the most common cause in an undermixed batter. Following that, uneven color can be caused by uneven heating in a poor quality machine, or by insufficient preheating. Stir the batter thoroughly, and give the machine additional time to heat. If the following wafer remains pale, increase the heat setting on the machine. Conversely, if the wafer seems burned or excessively dark, reduce the heat before making the next waffle (or else briefly unplug a machine with no dial), or try cooking the next wafer for less time."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<strong>To Shape a Waffle Cone:</strong> Place a hot wafer on a relatively non-conductive work surface, such as a clean kitchen towel or a cutting board. Set the waffle cone form on top, so that its tip is about 1/4 inch from the edge of the wafer, around the 10 o'clock mark. Fold the upper portion of the wafer over the form, and press firmly at the tip to create a seal. Roll the form over, working bit by bit to keep the wafer tight against the form, until you reach the outer edge. Hold the waffle cone firmly in place, seam side down, until cool enough to maintain its own shape, 30 to 45 seconds. Shaping the waffle cone is a skill, and will require a certain degree of practice to master."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<strong>To Shape a Waffle Bowl:</strong> Place a small bowl or ramekin, preferably one with smooth, rounded edges, upside down on a work surface, and have a second, identical bowl or ramekin at the ready. Immediately after griddling, place a hot wafer over the inverted ramekin, then place the second ramekin on top and gently press to nestle the two together. If desired, the excess wafer can be shaped by hand, to create a \"frill\" around the edges. When the wafer is cool enough to hold its own shape, remove from the ramekins (if left too long, it may stick to either ramekin)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "As soon as the waffle cones or bowls have cooled to room temperature, immediately transfer to an airtight container. The waffle cones and bowls are extremely susceptible to the effects of humidity, and can begin softening in as little as 15 minutes if left in the open. Likewise, if stored in a container while warm, the waffle cones and bowls may steam themselves and soften.  But if properly cooked and well protected from air, the cones and bowls will keep for a week or more at cool room temperature. Small sandwich-sized zip-top bags are ideal for protecting and storing the individual cones or bowls."}]}
