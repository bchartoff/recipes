Turn a portion of dough onto a powdered sugar&ndash;dusted surface and dust more powdered sugar on top.

Slide a thin offset spatula under dough to loosen any places that might have stuck and cut dough into 2-inch rounds. Arrange cutouts on a parchment-lined aluminum half-sheet pan, leaving about 1/2 inch between cookies. Gather the scraps, briefly knead, and re-roll and cut as before. Repeat with remaining dough, for a total of 50 pieces. Bake until just beginning to brown around the edges, about 15 minutes, and cool to room temperature directly on sheet pan.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Transfer cajeta to a pastry bag fitted with a plain 1/4-inch tip.

Alternatively, this can be done with a spoon. Top with remaining wafers and press gently to secure. Dust with powdered sugar and serve. In an airtight container, alfajores will keep 24 hours at room temperature or up to 1 week in the fridge.</p>"}]}
