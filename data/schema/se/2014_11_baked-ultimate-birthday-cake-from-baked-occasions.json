One big, beautiful must-try. In the case of <em>Baked Occasions</em>, this is that recipe. Three layers of densely spongy \"very vanilla\" cake are enveloped in layers of bright white frosting and coated with rainbow sprinkles. Cutting into the cake reveals more sprinkles, folded into the cake batter. The effect is childlike and utterly charming, with the innocent sweetness of vanilla providing the perfect backdrop.", "totalTime": "several hours", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 8-inch 3-layer cake", "recipeCategory": ["Bake the Book", "Cakes"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Very Vanilla Cake</strong>", "2 1/2 cups (315 g) cake flour", "3/4 cup (90 g) all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 ounces (1 stick/115 g) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pans", "1/2 cup (100 g) vegetable shortening, at room temperature", "1 3/4 cups (350 g) granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract", "1 large egg", "1 cup (240 ml) ice-cold water", "1/2 cup (120 ml) whole milk", "1/2 cup (120 ml) well-shaken buttermilk", "1 cup (190 g) rainbow sprinkles", "3 large egg whites, at room temperature", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "<strong>For the Very Vanilla Frosting</strong>", "1 1/2 cups (300 g) granulated sugar", "1/3 cup (40 g) all-purpose flour", "11/2 cups (360 ml) whole milk", "1/3 cup (75 ml) heavy cream", "12 ounces (3 sticks/340 g) unsalted butter, softened but cool, cut into small pieces", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla paste", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "<strong>For D\u00e9cor</strong>", "1 to 1 1/4 cups (190 to 240 g) rainbow sprinkles"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 325F (165C).
