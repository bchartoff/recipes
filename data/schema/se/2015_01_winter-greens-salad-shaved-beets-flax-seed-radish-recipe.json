By doing this, you release a lot of their natural sugars. Tossed with a simple vinaigrette, they become an ideal addition to a salad of hearty winter greens like endive, fris\u00e9e, and radicchio, their sweetness complemented by the bitter bite of the greens. Some shaved Parmesan, radishes, and toasted flax seeds finish this simple salad off.", "totalTime": "15 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["No-Cook", "Salads", "Thanksgiving", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 small shallot, finely minced", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 Belgian endive, separated into individual leaves", "1 small head radicchio, leaves separated and roughly torn", "1 head fris\u00e9e, yellow and pale green leaves only", "1 1/2 quarts loosely packed mixed greens such as beet greens, mizuna, and arugula", "1 watermelon radish or 3 to 4 red radishes, thinly sliced on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Benriner-Japanese-Mandoline-Slicer-Green/dp/B0000VZ57C/?tag=serieats-20\" target=\"_blank\">a mandoline</a>", "1 small chioggia or golden beet, thinly sliced on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Benriner-Japanese-Mandoline-Slicer-Green/dp/B0000VZ57C/?tag=serieats-20\" target=\"_blank\">a mandoline</a>", "1 tablespoon toasted flax seeds", "2 ounces shaved Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine lemon juice, mustard, and shallot in a medium bowl.
