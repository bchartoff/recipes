Combine rice, water, and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.

Stir cumin, sour cream, Cotija, cilantro, tomatoes, scallions, jalape\u00f1o, pepper, and remaining salt into mashed beans and mix until evenly combined. Gently mix in cooled rice. Taste mixture and, if necessary, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. (Note that the filling should be quite salty to compensate for there being no salt on the peppers.)

When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals out evenly over the charcoal grate. Place stuffed peppers on their sides and close the lid.

The peppers are finished once the filling is hot, the skins are well-charred, and the flesh is soft to the touch, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the grill and serve.</p>"}]}
