But for those with a smaller holiday table, a more diminutive entree is warranted. <strong><a href=\"http://www.aidells.com/our-way/aidells-story\">Bruce Aidell's</a></strong> <strong>Spinach and Gorgonzola-Stuffed Flank Steak</strong> from <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Meat-Cookbook-Everything/dp/0547241410/?tag=serieats-20\">The Great Meat Cookbook</a></em> is just the ticket. The stuffing is a snap to throw together but full of funky blue cheese and earthy spinach. Since the cheese makes the filling sticky, it stays put when rolled up into a pounded (or butterflied) flank steak. A quick sear and 25 minutes of roasting later, and the elegant, yet reasonably-sized holiday roast can be on the table.", "totalTime": "1 hour and 15 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 6", "recipeCategory": ["Beef", "Cook the Book", "Mains", "Spinach"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1 1/2- to 2 1/2-pound flank steak, trimmed", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 shallot, finely chopped", "1 pound spinach, washed, stemmed, and chopped", "1 cup fresh bread crumbs", "1/2 pound Gorgonzola or other blue cheese, crumbled", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To butterfly the steak: Using a long sharp knife, holding it parallel to the work surface, cut through one long side of the steak, stopping about 1/2 inch from the opposite side.
