Cook, stirring constantly, until the rice has absorbed most of the stock, 1 to 2 minutes. Add another ladleful of the simmering stock, and stir regularly until all of the broth is absorbed. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. The rice should cook slowly and should always be covered with a veil of stock. Repeat the procedure, stirring frequently and tasting regularly, until the rice is almost tender but firm to the bite, about 17 minutes total. Add the saffron stock at the end. The risotto should have a creamy, porridge like consistency.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the cheese.
