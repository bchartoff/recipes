The pasta sheet should be about 5 to 6 inches wide and approximately 2 feet long. Pipe a tube of the filling a half-inch in along the bottom edge of the pasta sheet the length of the sheet. Fold the pasta dough over the filling so that the pasta dough now encases the \"tube.\" Roll the tube over one more time then trim the pasta on the topside with a pastry cutter leaving a one-fourth of an inch. Starting at one side of the pasta \"tube\", pinch the tube at one-inch intervals to seal the sides of the agnolotti. Then using the pastry cutter cut the agnolotti's in the middle of the pinches to separate them. Lay the pasta out on to clean linen and allow to dry slightly, rotating them periodically. If they are not going to be cooked immediately, place them in the freezer to keep until ready to cook.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the dish:</strong> Heat the butter up in a saut\u00e9 pan and cook the cut corn until it is softened.

Remove the pasta to the pan with the shrimp and corn and add the purslane. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes and add salt and pepper to taste. Divide the pasta among 4 dishes and eat.</p>"}]}
