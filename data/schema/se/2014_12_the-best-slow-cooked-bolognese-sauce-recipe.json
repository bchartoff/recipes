To arrive at this version, I started with Barbara Lynch's great recipe, adding a few tweaks here and there to enhance meatiness and texture (hello, pancetta, gelatin, and fish sauce!) and employing a unique oven-based cooking technique that develops rich browned flavors, all while maintaining the tender, silky texture that the best sauces have. This is the kind of sauce that will leave you and your loved ones weak in the knees.", "totalTime": "4 to 5 hours", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 10", "recipeCategory": ["Beef", "Braising and Stewing", "Condiments and Sauces", "Fall", "Father's Day", "Italian", "Lamb", "Mains", "Mother's Day", "Pasta", "Pork", "Stovetop", "The Food Lab", "Valentine's Day", "Winter"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 quart  (1L) <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/10/best-rich-easy-white-chicken-stock-recipe.html\">homemade</a> or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock", "1 to 1 1/2 ounces powdered gelatin (4 to 6 packets; 30 to 45g), such as Knox (see note)", "1 (28-ounce; 800g) can peeled whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano", "1/2 pound (225g) finely minced chicken livers", "1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound (450g) ground beef chuck (about 20% fat)", "1 pound (450g) ground pork shoulder (about 20% fat)", "1 pound (450g) ground lamb shoulder (about 20% fat)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons (60g) unsalted butter", "1/2 pound (225g) finely diced pancetta", "1 large onion, finely minced (about 8 ounces; 225g)", "2 carrots, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)", "4 ribs celery, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)", "4 medium cloves garlic, minced", "1/4 cup (about 25g) minced fresh sage leaves", "1/2 cup (about 50g) minced fresh parsley leaves, divided", "2 cups (475ml) dry white or red wine", "1 cup (235ml) whole milk", "2 bay leaves", "1 cup (235ml) heavy cream", "3 ounces (85g) finely grated Parmesan cheese", "2 tablespoons (30ml) Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce, such as Red Boat", "<strong>To Serve:</strong>", "Dried or fresh pasta, preferably pappardelle, tagliatelle, or penne"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300&deg;F (150&deg;C).
