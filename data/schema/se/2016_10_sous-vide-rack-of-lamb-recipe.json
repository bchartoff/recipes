What's more, lamb tends to be leaner and smaller than a steak, which means that it's even more susceptible to accidental overcooking. All of this makes it an ideal candidate for cooking sous vide, which makes overcooking nearly impossible and perfectly edge-to-edge medium-rare results the norm.", "totalTime": "1 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours", "recipeYield": "Serves 3 to 4", "recipeCategory": ["Christmas", "Easter", "Gluten-Free", "Lamb", "Mains", "Sous Vide", "Spring", "The Food Lab"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 (8-bone) racks of lamb, about 2 pounds (900g) total", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Aromatics, such as fresh thyme or rosemary sprigs, sliced shallots, and sliced garlic (optional)", "2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable, canola, or rice bran oil", "2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat a sous vide cooker to desired final temperature according to chart above.
