Trim any remaining flesh from the inside or overly tough rind from the outside. Slice remaining rind into 1/4-inch planks. Cut into small decorative shapes with a cookie cutter or knife. Combine water, vinegar, Kool-aid, and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add watermelon and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain rind out into a heat proof container and continue simmering liquid until it reduces by about a third, around ten minutes. Pour reduced liquid over rind and allow to cool to room temperature, then cover and chill at least 24 hours.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Spoom</strong>: Combine watermelon pur\u00e9e and water. Using a stand mixer or electric handheld mixer, whip egg whites with salt on medium-high speed until foamy, then add sugar and whip on high speed until it forms glossy, firm peaks. Pour watermelon pur\u00e9e into meringue and fold with a whisk. Don't panic when it doesn't incorporate like most meringue-based treats, just keep mixing. Eventually you'll have a light pink, slightly fluffy thick liquid. Process in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow to firm up in the freezer in a sealed container for at least 4 hours before scooping.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To Make a Drink</strong>: For a 10 ounce glass, mix together 1/4 cup shrub and 1 tablespoon mint syrup. Fill glass with ice and pour in shrub mixture, then top with still or sparkling water. Add a few pieces of pickled watermelon rind and stir gently with a straw. Serve with watermelon spoom.</p>"}]}
