I'd shelved a banana cake recipe that had a few accidents along the way, but when I remembered the Nilla Wafer cake, I decided to dust it off and give it another go with the new secret ingredient. Mashed up bananas are cooked until reduced and concentrated for a stronger backbone of flavor. Of course, there are Nilla wafer crumbs for that signature vanillin flavor, and brown sugar and buttermilk are also ingredients. It's moist, rich, complex and coated with brown sugar cream cheese icing. It's sensational.
