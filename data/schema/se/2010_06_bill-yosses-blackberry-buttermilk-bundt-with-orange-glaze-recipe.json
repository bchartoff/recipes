What I once thought was a spacious kitchen seems shrinking with each new addition.  So, when I found this recipe for <strong>Blackberry Buttermilk Bundt  with Orange Glaze</strong> from <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Finish-Special-Desserts-Occasion/dp/0393059537/serieats-20\">The Perfect Finish</a></em> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Yosses\">Bill Yosses</a> I was hesitant to go out and buy the Bundt pan this recipe called for. But the beautiful photo that accompanied the recipe and the wealth of blackberries at the market won me over and the pan was purchased.  And, I have to say that I'm very pleased with my new Bundt pan and the first cake it baked.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "8 to 10", "recipeCategory": ["Cakes", "Cook the Book", "Desserts"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt ", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 (2 sticks) pound unsalted butter, softened, plus additional for the pan", "1 3/4 cups sugar ", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract              ", "1/2 cup buttermilk", "2 pints blackberries", "<strong>Orange Glaze</strong>", "1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (from about 1 medium orange)", "1/2 cup confectioners' sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p> Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.
