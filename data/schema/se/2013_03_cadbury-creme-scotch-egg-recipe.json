When eaten warm, the taste calls to mind that of a deep-fried candy bars that one can find at state fairs, but in my opinion, a slightly more complex flavor owing to the cocoa in the batter and the vanilla cookies. Speaking of the crumbs, they also give the treat a pleasing crunch, which acts as a pleasant texture contrast to the cakey batter and soft, gooey chocolate and sugar-filled interior.", "totalTime": "2 hours, 20 minutes", "recipeYield": "makes 4 eggs", "recipeCategory": ["Cakespy", "Candy", "Deep Frying"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 Cadbury Creme Eggs", "1 egg, beaten", "1/2 cup flour", "8-12 cups of vegetable or peanut oil, quantity depending on your pan", "1 cup flour", "1 tablespoon cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 cup milk", "1 tablespoon white vinegar", "1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1 1/2 cups vanilla wafers, crushed (I used Teddy Grahams)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Start out by unwrapping your Cadbury Creme Eggs.

If the oil is too cold it won't fry quickly enough and the chocolate eggs will soak up too much grease; if it is too hot, the outside will get dark before the inside is fully warmed, leaving you with a delicious shell but a still gooey batter on the inside. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Eat while still warm.</p>"}]}
