Microwave 1 cake at a time for 45 seconds on high power. Remove the cake from the microwave and immediately invert it onto a heatproof tray. Continue to microwave the remaining cakes until they are all cooked. The cakes can be eaten warm, room temperature, or refrigerated. We think they have the best flavor at room temperature. They will stay fresh for up to 3 days refrigerated inverted. </p>"}]}
