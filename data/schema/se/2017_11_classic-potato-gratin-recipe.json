To make it, thinly sliced Russet potatoes are layered with earthy Gruy\u00e8re and nutty-sweet Parmesan before being slowly baked in a bubbling bath of milk and cream. Going low-and-slow in the oven gently reduces the milk and cream, which breaks and coagulates into creamy curds within the layers of potato. A final blast under the broiler browns the top and yields a crispy golden crust.", "totalTime": "3 hours", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 as a side", "recipeCategory": ["American", "Baking", "Cheese", "Christmas", "Easter", "Fall", "Father's Day", "French", "Gluten-Free", "Mother's Day", "New Year", "Potato", "Sides", "Thanksgiving", "Valentine's Day", "Vegetarian", "Winter"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup (240ml) heavy cream", "2 cups (480ml) whole milk", "2 medium cloves garlic (8g), smashed", "2 small shallots (110g total), quartered", "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "6 sprigs fresh thyme", "2 teaspoons (6g) whole black peppercorns", "1 1/2 teaspoons (7g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt", "3 large russet potatoes (about 30 ounces; 800g)", "2 ounces (60g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese", "4 ounces (120g) grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese", "1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter, softened"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a small saucepan, combine cream, milk, garlic, shallots, nutmeg, thyme, peppercorns, and salt.
