Unlike other legumes like beans that don't stand up to high heat, <strong>chickpeas have an amazing tendency to turn nutty and crisp</strong> in a skillet or when roasted. As it happens, so does cauliflower, which also turns super caramelized and almost meaty.  This wonderful intersection is where this recipe is born.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": null, "recipeCategory": ["Cauliflower", "Dinner Tonight", "Legumes", "Pasta"], "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "1 head cauliflower, broken into florets", "1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "2 cups cubed crusty bread", "1 pound pasta, preferable shells", "Salt and pepper to taste", "3 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley", "1/2 cup fresh ricotta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
