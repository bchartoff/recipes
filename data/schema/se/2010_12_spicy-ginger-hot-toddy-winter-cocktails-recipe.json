My standby recipe is from an older version of a <em>Gourmet</em> cookbook for hot buttered rum that combines lemon juice, maple sugar, rum, boiling water and is dotted with a pat of butter. <strong>But I wanted to add a spicy element to the mix,</strong> using ginger tea as a base for the cocktail, which provides a tiny ginger burn at the back of the throat.", "totalTime": "15 to 25 minutes", "recipeYield": "makes 2 toddies", "recipeCategory": ["Ginger", "Rum", "Serious Heat", "Whiskey"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups water", "1 1/2-inch ginger root, thinly sliced", "4 to 6 cloves", "1 lemon, halved", "Honey, as needed ", "Rum or bourbon, as needed", "Lemon slices, as garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a medium saucepan, add water, gingerroot slices and cloves. Squeeze lemon juice into the saucepan, adding lemon halves into the liquid. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce to medium heat, so the liquid is bubbling.

Add enough honey and rum or bourbon to your tastes. Garnish with lemon slices, and serve. </p>"}]}
