It's my opinion that if you get good quality fresh liver, that process is simply a waste of milk.  Both the onions and the potatoes are cooked in leftover bacon fat and because of that, make sure you get very good quality bacon.  If you can't locate good quality bacon that you trust, cook the bacon separately and cook the onions and potatoes in a few tablespoons of butter.  Meals as simple as this are totally reliant on the quality of the ingredients that you use.   It's especially important when cooking offal that you make the extra effort to get the best ingredients you can find.", "totalTime": "40 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Bacon", "Beef", "Mains", "Offal", "Potato", "Sunday Supper"], "recipeIngredient": ["6-8 small potatoes", "8 strips bacon", "4 onions, thinly sliced", "2 sprigs thyme, leaves picked off", "Kosher salt and cracked black pepper", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 pounds calves liver divided into 4 even pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place potatoes in a pot and cover with water.
