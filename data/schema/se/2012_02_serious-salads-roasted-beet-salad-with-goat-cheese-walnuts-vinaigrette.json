Wipe or scrub beets clean then trim stems down to one-inch, leaving \u201ctails\u201d on. Place beets on a large piece of foil; drizzle with olive oil, then wrap foil around them to form a neat packet. Roast directly on rack in middle of oven until tender, about 1 hour. Test for doneness by piercing the largest beet with a knife. If it enters easily, it\u2019s done. Unwrap beets and let sit until cool enough to handle. Use your hands or a paring knife to peel skin, then cut into \u00bd-inch dice (I usually do this right on the aluminum foil but you can also use a stain-proof cutting board or plate).

Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>For the Salad: Place the greens in a large bowl, drizzle with about half of the vinaigrette and toss to combine.
