That is, until I get home, turn the heat to high, and char their skins until black. This trick, which we can thank Mexico for, intensifies the flavor, lends a wonderful smoky note, and, you know, looks really cool. No need to worry about burning your food; that's the point. The skins are peeled off and discarded and the tomatoes are blended with roasted garlic, chipotles, and red wine vinegar. The sauce is good to go. That's the sauce for these tostadas.", "totalTime": "45 minutes", "recipeYield": "4 people", "recipeCategory": ["Dinner Tonight", "Mexican", "Shrimp", "Tomato"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound tomatoes (about 2 large ones)", "2 garlic cloves, unpeeled ", "1 canned chipotle chile", "1 teaspoon red wine vinegar ", "\u00bd teaspoon salt ", "1 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and sliced in half lengthwise ", "1 tablespoon olive oil ", "12 flat tostada shells", "1 head lettuce (romaine, iceberg, or green leaf), shredded", "1 cup Mexican crema", "\u00bc cup fresh cilantro, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Set a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.
