A big, beautiful steak catches your eye at the market, perhaps a dry aged ribeye or a well marbled locally raised T-bone.  After a bit of inner dialogue (those things aren't cheap), you take the plug and take the steak home.  Then a moment of panic hits.  How am I going to cook this thing?  What if I overcook it and all of its beefy deliciousness is for naught?  \r\n\r\nTo resolve this beef related quandary, we present <strong>Mark Bittman's Grilled or Broiled Steak</strong> from <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-The-Basics/dp/0470528060/?tag=serieats-20\">How to Cook Everything The Basics</a></strong></em>.
