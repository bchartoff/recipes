The secret is not only to use apples, which help thicken the soup give it some body, but also to skip the stock and use apple cider instead. Along with white wine, it adds acidity and sweetness, which are also the best qualities in a good tomato.  A hit of sambal paste (a vinegary, chile condiment) gives it a tantalizing kick. The result is an intense base of flavor, rich and satisfying.", "totalTime": "60 minutes", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCategory": ["Dinner Tonight", "Mains", "Soups and Stews"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons butter", "1 large yellow onion, diced", "3 cloves garlic, sliced", "3 Honey Crisp or Fuji apples, peeled, cored, and sliced", "1/2 cup tomato paste", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon sambal chili paste", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "28 ounces canned whole peeled tomatoes", "4 cups apple cider", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "salt and pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a large, heavy soup pot (such as a Dutch oven), heat the butter over medium heat until it foams and subsides.
