I know the combination doesn't sound all that appealing at first, but in this case it really works.  A custardy mix of eggs and cream are mixed with caramelized onions, sauerkraut, and caraway seeds, all poured into a pie crust that's been brushed with Dijon mustard.  On top of that goes chopped country ham and a bit of chopped parsley&mdash;it does wonders to lend a lightness to what's otherwise a very serious pie.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "6", "recipeCategory": ["Bacon", "Cook the Book", "Ham", "Pies, Tarts, and Crumbles", "Pork"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the crust:</strong>", "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "4 tablespoons lard, chilled and cut into bits", "1/4 cup water", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard ", "<strong>For the filling:</strong>", "2 thick slices bacon, chopped", "2 medium onions, thinly sliced", "1 cup packed sauerkraut, rinsed and squeezed dry", "1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds", "1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 1/2 cups half-and-half", "3 large eggs", "1/4 pound cooked country ham, chopped", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.
