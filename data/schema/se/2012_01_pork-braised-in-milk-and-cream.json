But after a few conversations with a dear friend I was inspired to look into recipes for pork braised in milk and cream.  The final product is moist and tender, and the milk and cream create a thick, curdled, porky sauce that is unlike anything I have ever tasted before.", "totalTime": "4 hours 30 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Pork", "Sunday Supper"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoon butter, divided", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 2-3 pound boneless pork loin roast", "10 sage leaves, thinly sliced", "zest from 1/2 lemon", "1 cup cream", "1/2 cup milk", "kosher salt and cracked black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil over medium high heat and season pork loin on all sides with salt.

At the end of 4 hours remove lid; the remaining sauce should be thick, and beginning to look curdled.  Cook an additional 30 minutes, uncovered, keeping a close eye on the sauce; it will begin to take on a beige color.  Once sauce has thickened, remove roast and let sit for 10 minutes.
