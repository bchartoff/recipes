The bad news is that once mushrooms start showing discoloration or soft spots like that, they're not really any good for roasting or salads or even pizzas, where those flaws and soft spots make them kinda unappetizing. The good news is that they're still perfectly fine for creamy mushroom soup, where those flaws get blended away anyway. This recipe will work with pretty much any variety of mushroom I can think of, so go with whatever you like best.", "totalTime": "40 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Mushrooms", "Quick and Easy", "Sides", "Soups and Stews", "Stovetop", "Thanksgiving", "The Food Lab", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter (50g)", "2 pounds mixed mushrooms such as button, cremini, portabello, or shiitake (1kg), sliced", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)", "4 medium cloves garlic, minced", "2 tablespoons flour (45g)", "1 cup dry sherry or white wine (235ml)", "1 cup milk (235ml)", "5 cups (1.2L) <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/10/best-rich-easy-white-chicken-stock-recipe.html\">homemade</a> or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock, or water", "2 bay leaves", "2 sprigs fresh thyme", "Squeeze of lemon juice (optional)", "Minced fresh herbs such as parsley, chervil, tarragon, and chives for serving.", "Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Melt butter in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
