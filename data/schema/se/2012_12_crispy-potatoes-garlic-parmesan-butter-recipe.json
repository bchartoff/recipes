Heat 3 tablespoons  duck fat (or olive oil, if using) in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add as many potatoes as you can fit in a single layer, cut-side down (you should be able to fit about half the potatoes). Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until potatoes are golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to bowl with garlic butter. Repeat with remaining duck fat (or olive oil) and potatoes, transferring to same bowl. Toss potatoes to coat evenly in garlic-butter mixture, and season to taste with salt. Serve immediately.</p>"}]}
