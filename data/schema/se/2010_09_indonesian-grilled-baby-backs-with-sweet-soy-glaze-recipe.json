If you are using a gas grill, add the wood chips or chunks, if using, to the smoker box or place them in a smoker pouch under the grate. Brush and oil the grill grate. Place the racks of ribs bone side down in the center of the grate over the drip pan and away from the heat. (If your grill has limited space, you can stand the racks of ribs upright in a rib rack.)  Cover the grill and cook the ribs until tender, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. When the ribs are done, they\u2019ll be handsomely browned and the meat will have shrunk back from the ends of the bones by about 1/4 inch. If you are using a charcoal grill, you will need to add fresh coals after 1 hour.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>During the last 10 minutes of grilling, brush the ribs on both sides with the sweet soy glaze.
