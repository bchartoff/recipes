In chilly winter months, this process may take longer (see our <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/01/how-to-troubleshoot-winter-baking-projects.html\">guide to winter baking</a> for more info).</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>With the mixer running, crack in the egg and continue beating until smooth.

On a generously floured surface, roll a portion of the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch; check with a ruler to make sure your dough isn't too thin, or else the finished cookies will be more inclined to break. Slide an offset spatula underneath the dough to loosen. Cut with assorted cookie cutters and transfer to a parchment-lined half-sheet pan, leaving at least an inch of space in between cookies. Knead scraps together, then roll and cut as before. Repeat with remaining dough.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Transfer to oven to bake. For soft cookies, bake until puffed and firm but perfectly pale, about 12 minutes. For crisp cookies, continue baking until pale gold around the very edges, about 3 minutes more. Let the cookies cool to room temperature directly on the sheet pan, about 30 minutes. The true flavor and texture of the cookies will take another 30 minutes to develop.
