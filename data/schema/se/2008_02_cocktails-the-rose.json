Good luck finding it since then, which is a shame; soft, floral, lightly sweet and with a titillating aroma from the cherry eau de vie, the Rose is an exercise in delicate decadence, a drink that, like the <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2008/02/cocktails-widows-kiss-recipe.html\">Widow's Kiss</a>, can put the imbiber in a mindset from a completely different era.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCategory": ["Brandy and Cognac", "Liqueur and Fortified Wines"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces dry vermouth", "1 ounce kirsch (an unaged, unsweetened cherry brandy)", "1 teaspoon raspberry syrup or Chambord"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pour ingredients into a mixing glass and fill with ice.
