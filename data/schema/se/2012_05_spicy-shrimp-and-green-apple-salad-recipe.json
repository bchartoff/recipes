The exact amounts of these ingredients cannot be given, because it all depends on how tart or sweet the apples and tomatoes are as well as your heat tolerance. The overall flavor of the salad should be predominantly sour, then salty, with a tinge of sweetness from the fruits. Start with less lime juice and fish sauce than you think prudent as you can always add more. (It's good to have about 1/4 cup of fish sauce and 3-4 limes on hand just so you know you have enough ingredients to work with even though you may not need to use all of them. Also, take into consideration whether your cashews are salted or not. If they are, go easy on the fish sauce.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Add in the cashews and mint leaves; toss the salad again.
