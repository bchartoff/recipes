The dish is a simple one with only six ingredients (including salt and pepper), but each element packs a punch. The Gruy&egrave;re's funky flavor cuts the sweetness of the potatoes and richness of the cream, and the diced pancetta contributes its own salty, sweet, and spicy notes. The most unique part about this gratin, however, isn't in the ingredient list. Instead of shingling the potatoes in a large baking dish, cnevertz layers individual servings in a muffin tin, making for a button-cute finish to this easy side.", "totalTime": "1 hour and 10 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 12", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Sides", "Sweet Potatoes and Yams"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium sweet potatoes (1 pound)", "4 ounces Gruy\u00e8re cheese, shredded (1 cup)", "4 ounces pancetta, cut into small dice (1 cup)", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper", "3/4 cup heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat the oven to 400\u00b0F.
