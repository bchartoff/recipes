You get pretty much the same taste out of it without nearly as much fuss. This appeals to a lazy person like me who's always looking for a faster, easier way to do everything.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Puddings and Custards", "Pumpkin"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 large eggs", "1 cup coconut milk", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/4 cup rice flour", "1 teaspoon vanilla or coconut extract", "1 1/4 cups of diced (1/4-inch) pumpkin flesh"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Prepare a steamer over boiling water.
