In the South, however, gravy is used to \"smother\" everything from fried chicken and pork chops to sweet Vidalia onions and the perennial favorite: buttery biscuits. In <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Around-Southern-Table-comforting-treasured/dp/0848736532/?tag=serieats-20\">Around the Southern Table</a></em>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.rebeccalangcooks.com/\">Rebecca Lang</a></strong> takes this classic brunch dish and gives it a unique twist. Instead of building the gravy from sausage or coffee, she combines salty and rich bacon drippings with diced tomatoes and a slight pour of milk. The tomatoes serve to brighten the whole shebang, but the bacon drippings keep things from getting too virtuous. The biscuits? Lang's are ginormous \"cat-heads,\" made with a dead-simple mixture of self-rising flour, bacon drippings, butter, and buttermilk.", "totalTime": "1 1/2 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 8", "recipeCategory": ["Biscuit", "Breakfast and Brunch", "Cook the Book", "Pork"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Biscuits</strong>", "5 tablespoons warm bacon drippings", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "3 1/2 cups self-rising soft-wheat flour (such as White Lily)", "1 1/3 cups buttermilk, at room temperature", "&nbsp", "<strong>Tomato Gravy</strong>", "2 tablespoons bacon drippings", "1 cup finely chopped Vidalia onion", "2 tablespoons all-purpose soft-wheat flour (such as White Lily)", "2 cups peeled, seeded, and finely chopped tomato", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper", "1/2 cup milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Make the biscuits:</strong> Preheat oven to 375\u00b0.
