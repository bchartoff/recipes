Peel top 1/3 of each apple.  Using a melon baller, remove core and seeds of each apple.  Divide apricot jam and rum between each apple, pouring equal amounts in hollowed-out core.  Using your fingers mash butter, oats, flour and brown sugar into a paste, and divide into four equal balls.    Carefully, so as not to pour out any of the rum or jam, press the oat/butter mixture onto the top of each apple.  Place on a baking sheet and cook until the crumble is crisp and the apples are soft, about 30 minutes.  Serve hot and topped with whipped cream.</p>"}]}
