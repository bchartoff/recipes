And what cool science it is. In 2006, Mark Bittman introduced the world to a recipe from <a href=\"http://www.sullivanstreetbakery.com/history\">Jim Lahey</a> of <a href=\"http://www.sullivanstreetbakery.com/history\">Sullivan Street Bakery</a>, which had a whole bunch of home cooks opening up their Dutch ovens and exclaiming <em>oh my goodness&mdash;I can't believe I just did that!</em> It certainly had me thinking that. Even more interesting to me than <em>that</em> it works is <em>how</em> it works, because by understanding the how, we can then modify the recipe to fit many different baking situations, even improving its flavor.", "totalTime": "3 days", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 loaf, serving 4 to 6", "recipeCategory": ["Bread", "Dairy-Free", "The Food Lab", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["300 grams (10.5 ounces, about 2 cups) bread flour or all-purpose flour", "4.5 grams (about 3/4 teaspoon) salt", "3 grams (about .5 taspoons) yeast", "210 grams (7.5 ounces, about 1 cup minus 1.5 tablespoons) water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl and whisk to combine.
