Wait another 5 minutes, then cut the biscotti into 1/4- to 3/4-inch slices. How thick you slice them depends on a number of factors. This recipe, without nuts or any add-ins, is easy to slice thin. Once you start adding chips, almonds, raisins, and other chunky ingredients, a 3/4-inch slice is more realistic. When you're slicing, be sure to cut straight up and down, if you cut at an angle, biscotti may be thicker at the top than the bottom, and they'll topple over during their second bake.  </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Set the biscotti upright on the prepared baking sheet.
