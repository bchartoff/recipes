To turn it into a dip for dumplings, we temper it with honey, sesame seeds, and melted butter to create a smooth sauce that's intensely sweet, spicy, buttery, and just a little nutty all at once.", "totalTime": "5 minutes", "recipeYield": "Makes about 1 cup", "recipeCategory": ["Condiments and Sauces"], "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "9 tablespoons kimchi paste (see note)", "1 tablespoon honey", "1 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat.
