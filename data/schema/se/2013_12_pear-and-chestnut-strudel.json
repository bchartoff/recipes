If you have parchment sheets, fold one in half, creasing sharply. If you are using rolled parchment, cut a piece that is at least two feet long and crease sharply in the middle. Place dough in between parchment and roll as thin as possible, turning, peeling and flipping parchment as needed to keep dough even and rectangular. You should end up with a rough square of about 12- by 12- inches, though it may be more rectangular if using sheet parchment. Gently peel parchment from top, then flip and repeat so dough won't stick and tear.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Arrange filling evenly in a line an inch or two up from the bottom edge of the dough. Use parchment to roll bottom of dough up over filling, then gently peel it away. Continue to tightly roll dough, using parchment to push, until all dough is rolled around filling and top edge is tucked underneath. Trim parchment to fit on a baking sheet, then use remaining parchment on either side of roll as a sling to gently lift strudel onto baking sheet.
