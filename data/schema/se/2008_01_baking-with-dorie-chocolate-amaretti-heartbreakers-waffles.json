There\u2019s no need to worry, but you do want to keep an eye on these. Transfer the finished waffles to a cooling rack while you make the rest of the batch. Right before serving, warm these briefly, about 2 minutes in the oven&mdash;or don\u2019t.

Hot fudge sauce is both luscious and luxurious over these. Alternatively, separate the hearts and serve with all the toppings on the side or turn these into crisp cookies (see Playing Around).</p>"}]}
