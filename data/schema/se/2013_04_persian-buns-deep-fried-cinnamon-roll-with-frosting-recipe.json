Use wooden chopsticks or heat resistant tongs to turn the cinnamon rolls and fry until deep golden brown on both sides (about 1-2 minutes per side, use the color as your guide keeping a close eye on keeping the oil temperature as constant as possible).  Remove cinnamon rolls immediately from the pan using a heat resistant strainer or tongs. Set on paper towel lined baking racks to cool. Once cooled slightly, frost and serve immediately.</p>"}]}
