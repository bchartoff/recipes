Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll a heaping tablespoon of dough into a ball and dip it into a shallow bowl of Fleur de sel or Kosher salt, so the coarse salt sits atop the ball. Place on cookie sheet, salty side up, leaving a couple of inches of space between the dough balls. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake until the edges of the cookies are golden brown, about 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. Can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>"}]}
