The warm, vaguely Asian spice blend rubbed into the belly may not seem an obvious complement to a Southwestern-style peach salsa, but a quick glance through the ingredients reveals commonalities: cilantro, lime, and chile all play their parts in both cuisines, and peaches themselves are one of America's favorite imports from China. Not to mention, that once the peach salsa is piled on top of thinly sliced, quiveringly rich belly, it's hard to imagine doubting Slater's genius.", "totalTime": "12 hours", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Mains", "Peach", "Pork"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 pounds pork belly, boned, skin intact and finely scored", "\u00a0", "<strong>For the Rub</strong>", "3 cloves garlic", "2 tablespoons light soy sauce", "1 tablespoon peanut oil", "2 teaspoons salt", "1/2 teaspoon dried chile flakes", "1 slightly heaping teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder", "\u00a0", "<strong>For the Peach Salsa</strong>", "2 green onions", "1 small red chile", "3 peaches", "8 cherry tomatoes", "1 small bunch cilantro", "Juice of 2 limes", "3 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Put the pork in a china or glass dish.
