Bachman emphasizes the importance of aging the bitters in a used American oak barrel, which can be difficult to source. He either uses seasoned casks from Willett or the distillery's smaller 20-liter new oak barrels, which he then seasons with grain neutral spirit to remove primary wood tannin. Do not use new oak, he notes, as the wood tannins will overwhelm subtler flavors.", "totalTime": "about 2 months", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 cocktail", "recipeCategory": ["Whiskey"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Barrel-aged Stone Fruit Bitters</strong>", "1 pound dried plums", "1 pound dried apricots", "1 pound dried peaches", "2 ounces quassia bark", "1/2 ounce wild cherry bark", "1/2 ounce fresh orange peel", "1/4 ounce betel nut", "1/10 ounce tansy", "1/4 ounce Chinese rhubarb", "2 gallons high-proof neutral grain spirit", "\u00a0", "<strong>For Palm Sugar Syrup</strong>  ", "6 ounces water", "6 ounces coconut palm sugar ", "\u00a0", "<strong>For Cocktail</strong>   ", " 2 ounces Redemption Rye", " 1 ounce Cardamaro", "1/4 ounce palm sugar syrup", "4 to 5 dashes barrel-aged stone fruit bitters", "Lemon twist"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To make bitters, co-macerate all bitters ingredients in large glass vessel for 15 days.
