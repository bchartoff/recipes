A tower of cookies layered with whipped cream or custard sits overnight in the fridge. After the stint, the cookies have absorbed the moisture, turning into a cakey consistency. Hands down, it's one of the simplest ways to create a cake, which comes in handy after a holiday season full of frenzied baking. And since I add a blast of heat to everything, the whipped cream for this chocolate icebox cake is flavored with cocoa powder, New Mexican chile powder and cayenne. The result is a chocolate-chile slice of heaven that has never been easier to create.", "totalTime": "30 minutes, plus overnight", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeCategory": ["Cakes", "Chocolate", "Serious Heat"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa powder", "2 teaspoons New Mexican chile powder", "1 teaspoon cayenne powder ", "2 teaspoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup heavy cream ", "1 (14.4-box) chocolate graham crackers"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a medium bowl, add cocoa powder, chile powder, cayenne, sugar, extract and heavy cream.
