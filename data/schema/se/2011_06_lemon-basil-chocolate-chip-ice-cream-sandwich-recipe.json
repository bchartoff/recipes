But while mint leaves are usually steeped in the cream for upwards of an hour or two before getting strained out, basil benefits more from a short initial steeping before getting blended into the base. I forego chocolate chips or drizzling melted chocolate for simply shaving chocolate directly into the ice cream as it's finishing the churn.", "totalTime": "2 1/2 hours (plus an overnight chill)", "recipeYield": "serves 10 (makes 10 sandwiches)", "recipeCategory": ["Ice Cream and Frozen Treats", "Lemon"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For basil chocolate chip ice cream</strong>", "3 cups half-and-half (or 1 1/2 cups each cream and milk)", "3 cups washed basil leaves and stems, lightly packed (about one large bunch)", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup sugar", "6 egg yolks", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "2 ounces dark chocolate, shaved fine with a vegetable peeler", "\u00a0", "<strong>For lemon butter cookies</strong>", "1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed", "1/2 cup sugar", "Zest of three lemons", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 egg", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 1/4 cups cake flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For basil chocolate chip ice cream:</strong> In a medium saucepan, bring half-and-half to a simmer, then add basil and salt.
