Once cooked through, the vegetables are tossed out with the broth and the beef is finely chopped with fresh onions and bell peppers, then finished off with a squeeze of lime juice. It's a rather healthy dish, especially when compared to many of our other national favorites that just love being submerged in sizzling lard or oil.", "totalTime": "1 hour", "recipeYield": "serves 6", "recipeCategory": ["Beef", "Latin American", "Latin Cuisine", "Mains"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds beef round, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes", "1 large green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into 1 inch pieces", "1 large white or yellow onion, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces", "Kosher salt", "2 teaspoons black peppercorns", "4 medium garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "Cold water", "1 lime", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place beef, 1/2 bell pepper, 1/2 onion, 2 teaspoons salt, peppercorns, and garlic in large pot.
