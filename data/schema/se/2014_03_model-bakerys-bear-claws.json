Rotate the dough so the long open seam faces you. Roll out the dough again into an 18-by-10-inch rectange. If at any time some of the butter oozes through the dough (it shouldn't), sprinkle some flour over the area to seal it. Repeat the folding into thirds for a second turn, brushing excess flour off the dough as needed. Place on a small baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes. This brief resting period will relax the gluten and lightly chill the butter, making the dough easier to roll and keeping the butter layers from softening. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Unwrap the dough and place on the lightly floured work surface with the long open seam facing you.
