Tamales are traditionally Mexican and the tale of how they made their way into the canon of Southern cooking more than a century ago is a truly American one.  There are many takes on the story, but they all have something to do with Mexican laborers migrating north from Texas to pick cotton.  There they shared their corn husk-wrapped snacks with African-American laborers and the tradition of the Mississippi Delta tamale was born.", "totalTime": "3 hours 30 minutes", "recipeYield": "7 to 8 dozen", "recipeCategory": ["Cook the Book", "Corn"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the meat filling:</strong>", "6 to 8 pounds boneless meat (pork shoulder, chuck roast, or chicken)", "\u00be cup vegetable oil", "\u00bc cup chili powder", "2 tablespoons paprika", "2 tablespoons salt", "2 teaspoons black pepper", "1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper", "1 tablespoon onion powder", "1 tablespoon garlic powder ", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "<strong>For the corn husks:</strong>", "1 to 2 packages dried corn husks", "<strong>For the masa dough:</strong>", "8 cups maseca (masa mix) or yellow cornmeal ", "4 teaspoons baking powder", "2 teaspoons salt", "1\u2154 cups lard or vegetable shortening", "6 to 8 cups warm meat broth (from cooking the meat) "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>To make the meat filling:</strong> Cut the meat into large chunks and place in a large, heavy pot.
