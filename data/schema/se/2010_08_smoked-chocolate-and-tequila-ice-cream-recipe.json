To temper eggs, you need to warm them up before pouring them into the hot half-and-half; if you pour the cold yolks directly into the pot, they'll curdle and you'll wind up with scrambled eggs floating in your ice cream base. Start by scooping a few ladlefuls of hot half-and-half into your eggs, and mix well to incorporate. When the outside of the mixing bowl is warm to the touch, you'll know the eggs are ready. Pour them slowly and carefully back into the pot, using a rubber spatula to scrape out the bowl. Mix to make sure all the yolks are dissolved into the half-and-half.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Continue to cook the ice cream base over low/medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 8 to 10 minutes.

This is pushing the upper limit of the amount of alcohol an ice cream can contain and still be able to freeze&mdash;if you're not into the taste of tequila, only use 3 tablespoon or choose another alcohol that you like better.
