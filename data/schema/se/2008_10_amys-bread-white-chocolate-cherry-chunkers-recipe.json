Press down lightly to flatten them to a thickness of about 2 inches. They will spread a lot during baking. Bake the cookies for about 18 minutes, rotating the cookies halfway through the baking time. They should be golden brown and baked all the way to the center. They should be soft, but be careful not to underbake them or they'll be doughy and will fall apart easily. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Let cookies cool on the sheets for 5 minutes, then move them to a rack and cool completely before serving.</p>"}]}
