Don\u2019t overheat the skillet, or the outsides of the brussels sprouts will cook too quickly. Place the brussels sprouts in the pan flat side down (single-layer), sprinkle with a couple pinches of salt, cover, and cook for roughly 5-10 minutes; the bottoms of the sprouts should only show a hint of browning. Cut into or taste one of the sprouts to gauge whether they\u2019re tender throughout. If not, cover and cook for a few more minutes.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Once just tender, uncover, turn up the heat, and cook until the flat sides are deep brown and caramelized. Use tongs or a metal spatula to toss them once or twice to get some browning on the rounded side. Season with more salt, a few grinds of pepper, and a dusting of grated cheese. While you might be able to get away with keeping a platter of these warm in the oven for a few minutes, they are exponentially tastier if popped in your mouth immediately.</p>"}]}
