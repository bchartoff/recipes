At The Spotted Pig, Bloomfield does drinking snacks right, and these <strong>Devils on Horseback</strong> are the ideal way to soak up whatever you're sipping.\n\nBacon wrapped prunes would be wonderful on their own but in typical Bloomfield fashion, she takes it a step further by plumping the prunes in tea and Armagnac, and stuffing them with tiny bits of tender poached pear.  These are the kind of snacks that go fast, doubling the recipe might be a good plan.", "totalTime": null, "recipeYield": "makes 10", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Bacon"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Pears:</strong>", "2 cups dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc ", "1 cup white wine vinegar ", "1 cup superfine sugar  ", "1 tablespoon sliced skin-on fresh ginger ", "10 black peppercorns", "4 whole allspice berries ", "About 4 dried pequin chilies or pinches of red pepper flakes ", "1 large cinnamon stick ", "3 large perfectly ripe Bartlett pears ", "<strong>For the Prunes</strong>", "1 English Breakfast tea bag, preferably PG Tips brand ", "3 tablespoons Armagnac or Cognac ", "10 large pitted prunes ", "10 thin slices bacon  ", "Maldon or another flaky sea salt ", "2 or 3 dried pequin chilies or pinches of red pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the pears:</strong> Combine the first eight ingredients in a pot just big enough for the pears to be submerged in the liquid in a snug fit. one at a time, peel the pears and halve them lengthwise.
