This steak and potatoes dinner clocks in at under half an hour including resting time for the sirloin. New potatoes boil while the steak is searing and are then smashed and browned in the steak's pan juices. Once the potatoes have crisped they are removed from the skillet and a quick pan sauce of lemon, parsley, and anchovies is warmed and poured over the plate.", "totalTime": "30 minutes", "recipeYield": "1", "recipeCategory": ["Beef", "Cook the Book", "Potato"], "recipeIngredient": ["2 or 3 small new potatoes (about 3 ounces total), scrubbed", "1 (4-ounce) boneless sirloin steak, preferably no more than 1/2 inch thick, trimmed of excess fat", "1 plump clove garlic", "Kosher or sea salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil ", "1 anchovy fillet, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Bring a 2-quart saucepan of water to a boil.
