Take the pizzas off the grill and toss on some fresh basil leaves and a sprinkle of kosher salt.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you want, you can make this the night before you want to cook it, with cool water, and put it in the refrigerator. Let the dough come to room temperature before you grill it. You can take out a hunk of dough to make a little pizza every night for a week. This pizza also bakes up great in the oven. Set your oven on as high as it can go and preheat for 30 minutes. If you have a pizza stone, please put it in before you turn on the oven. You can use a pizza tray, a large piece of parchment paper, or put the pizza dough directly onto the pizza stone. Use half the dough this recipe yields for a 12-inch pizza.</p>"}]}
