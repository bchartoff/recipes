You want to spread it as flat and evenly as possible, so that the top layer of chocolate will lay fairly flat on top. Return the pan to the refrigerator while you prepare the top layer; chilling it will make the middle layer more firm so that it won't melt when you pour the chocolate topping on top of it.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Prepare the top layer: </strong>Melt chocolate and butter over low heat. Cool. Once cool, but still liquid, pour over second layer. Sprinkle the cranberries (and a bit of coconut too, if you'd like) on top while the chocolate is still soft and glossy (they won't adhere if you wait until it has hardened or cooled) and chill in refrigerator until the topping has set. When ready to serve, remove from the refrigerator and let come to close to room temperature before slicing into bars; if you cut while the mixture is still cold, the top layer can crack. They still taste good, but ideally to get clean slices, you want to slice the bars when they are cool-but-not-cold.</p>"}]}
