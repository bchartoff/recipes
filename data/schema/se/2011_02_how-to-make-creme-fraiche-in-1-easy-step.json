The ratio of cream to buttermilk doesn't really matter all that much; add more buttermilk and you'll need less time for the cream to thicken (but it'll be less creamy). Add more, and it takes longer, but tastes better. We found one tablespoon of buttermilk per cup of cream <strong>(that's a 1:16 ratio)</strong> to strike the best balance.", "totalTime": "12 hours", "recipeYield": "Makes 2 cups", "recipeCategory": ["Condiments and Sauces", "Desserts", "French", "No-Cook"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 pint (16 oz) heavy cream", "2 tablespoons (1 oz) cultured buttermilk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Combine buttermilk and heavy cream in non-reactive container.
