Cook the steaks, turning them once halfway through the cooking, until they are medium-rare to medium. The timing will vary depending on which cooking method you are using. If possible, test if they are ready with an instant-read thermometer, which should register 140\u00b0F to 150\u00b0F, the ideal level of doneness for this dish.
