But these bran-fermented vegetables are a different story. Called <em>nuka</em> in Japan, they're traditionally made by burying relatively dense vegetables, like daikon or carrot, in a salty fermented rice bran mixture fortified with kelp, miso, and/or beer. The vegetables take only a day or so to ferment, and emerge from the bran relatively crisp, tasting lightly of salted sourdough.", "totalTime": "4 to 5 days", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCategory": ["Condiments and Sauces", "Cook the Book", "Pickling", "Sides", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["1-gallon crock", "2 pounds bran (rice, wheat, or oat)", "3 strips dried kelp (optional)", "2 1/2 cups nonchlorinated water", "3/4 cup handcrafted beer (ale or lager), at room temperature", "3/4 cup unrefined fine sea salt", "1/4 cup miso (optional)", "1-inch piece fresh ginger, cut into small chunks", "Vegetable scraps (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup), for jump-starting the bran mixture ", "2 to 2 1/2 cups vegetables (small root vegetables, pickling cucumbers, baby onions, cauliflower florets, asparagus, green beans, and ginger), for pickling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Dry-toast the bran in a large skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or spread on a baking sheet and roast in a 300\u00b0F oven just until you can smell it, about 7 minutes.

Brush off any bits of bran from the pickles or gently slosh them in a bowl of cool water to remove excess. The pickles are ready to consume. It is best to eat them within a day or two after pickling.

You do not need to wash the crock, as the bacteria within will be good for the next batch. Start a new batch of pickles or plug in a few bits of veggies to keep the bacteria colony going. Cover the crock with cheesecloth and set at room temperature for a day. If not using within 24 hours, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature and massage with your clean hands before making your next batch of pickles. Handled properly, with salt and water replenished as needed, this bran mixture will only get better with time. You\u2019ll be able to pass it along to a loved one! </p>"}]}
