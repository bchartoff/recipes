(The authors recommend a 6-quart pot, but in my experience that is not large enough to hold these ingredients plus, later, the pork. I use a 9 1/2-quart Dutch oven, which is a little roomy but works fine.

Use a sharp knife to slice the skin from the shoulder with a gentle sawing motion, working back from the point diagonally across from the leg end where the skin forms a corner (you can ask your butcher to do this to save yourself time). Leave a thin layer of fat on the shoulder. Season the pork with the salt and black pepper.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pour the oil into a 12-inch skillet or saut\u00e9 pan and heat over a high flame.

I\u2019m not going to lie to you\u2014this is pretty gross, because the muscles in the shoulder are very articulated and, well, muscle-y. But you can\u2019t run from the fact that you\u2019re eating an animal here, so fortify yourself with a beer and get to it. Refrigerate the pulled pork overnight in a container with the sauce.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>When the time comes to serve the tacos, reheat the pork gently in its sauce on top of the stove. Chop the cilantro and slice the onion very thin. Warm the flour tortillas (I do this in a skillet, individually, but this gets really tiresome with so many tortillas\u2014any great ideas out there about how to warm a bunch of tortillas at once and still have them taste and feel good?) Let your guests build their own tacos, adding as much cilantro and onion as they like. The Lee brothers recommend using 1/4 cup pork and sauce per taco.</p>"}]}
