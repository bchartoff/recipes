Sounds fancy, right? But they're not. Revueltos are simply creamy, barely-set Spanish-style scrambled eggs that are cooked in a warm (not hot) pan with a) good-quality olive oil; b) tons of garlic; and c) pretty much any neutrally-flavored leftovers you've got. After cooking the eggs slowly, scraping the pan constantly to break up the curds that form, you'll be left with with custardy eggs that have a velvety, super-soft texture.", "totalTime": "10 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 2", "recipeCategory": ["Mother's Day", "Potato", "Scrambled Eggs", "Vegetarian"], "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup diced cooked potatoes (see note)", "1/2 cup cooked greens such as spinach or kale (see note)", "2 medium garlic cloves, minced (about 2 teaspoons)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 eggs, beaten and seasoned with salt and pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat.
