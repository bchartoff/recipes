Most of the pasta recipes in the book call for store-bought pasta. (She does include one recipe for gluten-free fresh pasta, but doesn't provide an assembled recipe using it.) While I'm sure that gluten-free pasta options have improved significantly since that fateful quinoa noodle disaster, I wasn't sure I wanted to mess up dinner with a poor grocery store choice.
