Unlike the individual hand pies of Latin America, this empanada is formed as a large baked pie with a wheat crust and filled with onions, green peppers, and your choice of protein. Only after it's baked does it get cut into individual portions. Here's how to make it at home with a classic tuna filling.", "totalTime": "3 hours", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 10", "recipeCategory": ["Appetizers and Hors d'Oeuvres", "Bread", "Breakfast and Brunch", "Fish", "Onion", "Sides", "Snacks", "Spanish"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>For the Dough:</strong>", "12 3/4 ounces all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon instant yeast", "8 ounces warm (120\u00b0F) water", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing", "<strong>For the Filling:</strong>", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 cups (1-inch) diced green bell pepper (about 2 large peppers)", "4 cups (1-inch) diced yellow onion (about 4 small to medium onions)", "15 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "2 (250-gram, about 8.5 ounces) cans oil-packed bonito tuna, such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ortiz-Velero-Bonito-Norte-Packed/dp/B000N1662M/?tag=serieats-20\">Ortiz</a>, drained", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>For the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, and yeast.
