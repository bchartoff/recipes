In <strong>Lauryn Chun's</strong> <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Kimchi-Cookbook-Traditional-Modern/dp/1607743353/?tag=serieats-20\">The Kimchi Cookbook</a></em>, she presents a recipe for the house pickle from her company, <a href=\"http://milkimchi.com/\">Mother-in-Law's Kimchi</a>. As she writes in the intro to the recipe, Chun's recipe is a variation on a fall harvest kimchi, typically eaten fresh, immediately after mixing. Chun prefers to ferment the mixture of chile flakes, salted shrimp, garlic, ginger, and cabbage for a few days before eating; this is how her product is sold. The moderate fermentation time allows the seasonings to mellow a bit and take on kimchi's signature effervescent quality.", "totalTime": "2 to 3 days", "recipeYield": "makes 8 cups", "recipeCategory": ["Condiments and Sauces", "Cook the Book", "Korean", "Sides"], "recipeIngredient": ["<strong>Brine</strong>", "2 medium heads (4 to 5 pounds total) napa cabbage", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "\u00a0", "<strong>Seasoning Paste</strong>", "2 tablespoons salted shrimp", "1/3 cup <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/sweet-rice-flour-porridge-from-the-kimchi-cookbook-recipe.html\">Sweet Rice-Flour Porridge</a>", "1/4 cup anchovy sauce ", "1/4 cup beef stock ", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 tablespoon peeled, finely grated fresh ginger ", "2 teaspoons sugar", "2/3 cup Korean chile pepper flakes", "\u00a0", "1/2 cup thinly sliced yellow onion", "4 green onions, green parts only, cut into 2-inch pieces (about 1/2 cup)", "3 ounces Korean chives or 1/2 bunch European chives, cut into 4-inch pieces (about 1/4 cup)", "6 to 8 fresh oysters (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Cut the cabbage into quarters, and then cut each quarter in half lengthwise and cut out the core.

As it ferments, cabbage will expand, so be sure to place the jar on a plate or in a bowl to catch the overflow.</p>"}]}
