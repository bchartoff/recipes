To test the oil, drop a little crumb of choux pastry into the pot.  It should sink, and then start to rise, surrounded by little fizzing bubbles.  You do not want to fry the beignets too hot; they will become brown on the outside, and will remain raw on the inside.  Instead, you want them to gently simmer in the oil, surrounded by bubbles, but not browning intensely.  Drop a teaspoon of dough into the oil.  It will puff; then appear to crack, and will be cooked to a very light gold in about 8 minutes.  The crack that occurs in the dough signifies that the interior dough has cooked and created an air pocket; it is the sign you are looking for.  Once the dough has \u201ccracked,\u201d cook for a couple more minutes to ensure the light golden color and crisp exterior.  Be careful not to overcrowd the pan with raw beignets.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Drain the beignets on paper towels, and immediately toss them hot into the lavender sugar, and roll them around to coat.
