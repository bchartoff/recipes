While the standard is a thin, griddled patty with a spiced ketchup-based sauce, my take on it is a slightly larger version designed for the backyard grill with a boldly seasoned pork and beef patty, a creamier sauce, and more vegetables. The crisp shoestring potatoes that are the hallmark of a traditional frita remain the same.", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Beef", "Burger", "Caribbean", "Latin Cuisine", "Mains", "Pork", "Potato", "Sandwiches", "The Burger Lab", "The Food Lab"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 potato, peeled and cut into 1/8th inch matchsticks with a mandoline or by hand", "1 quart peanut or canola oil", "Kosher salt", "1/4 cup ketchup", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "1 tablespoon ground cumin, divided", "1 tablespoon paprika, divided", "2 cloves garlic, finely minced (about 2 teaspoons), divided", "1 teaspoon white vinegar", "1 teaspoon sugar", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "12 ounces ground beef", "8 ounces ground pork", "Sliced American, cheddar, Swiss, or pepper jack cheese, as desired", "Sliced onions, shredded iceberg lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and pickles, as desired", "4 toasted hamburger buns"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Rinse cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water, changing water as necessary until water runs clear.
