While the molds are heating, place the beeswax in a plastic, microwave-safe container and microwave in 30-second increments, swirling each time, until the beeswax is fully liquified. Add the butter and microwave until it has fully melted, then stir until you have a solution of butter and beeswax. (This may also be done on the stovetop in a saucepan, but cleaning beeswax from pots is an unsavory activity, using the microwave is highly recommended.)  Remove the molds from the oven and allow them to cool for one minute. Set up a cooling rack with plastic wrap underneath. Grasp the molds one at a time with the tongs, coat the insides of the molds with the wax mixture using a pastry brush (silicone is recommended, you will need to boil the pastry brush to get the wax off later) then invert the molds on top of the cooling rack and allow the excess wax to drip off. Once the wax has cooled back to opaque, place the molds in the freezer for two hours.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Once it's time to bake: </strong>Set a baking stone on the bottom rack of the oven and place a sheet tray on top. Preheat the oven to 500&deg;F. When the oven is ready, remove the molds from the freezer and fill them almost to the top, leaving a centimeter of space at the top of the molds. Remove the preheated sheet tray from the oven, line with parchment, and then place the filled molds on the heated tray, spacing them evenly and far apart. Place the tray of molds onto the stone in the oven, and watch it carefully for the first 30 minutes of baking. The canel\u00e9 will start to bubble, then rise up out of the molds. When they rise more than one centimeter above the rim of the mold, use tongs to remove the mold and allow the canel\u00e9 to sink all the way back down into the mold, then return it to the oven. You will need to do this for the first 30-45 minutes of baking, until you notice that the canel\u00e9 have developed an outer skin and a space has formed between the mold and the canel\u00e9 on all sides. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this has happened, drop the temperature of the oven to 400&deg;F and allow the canel\u00e9 to finish baking, approximately 45 more minutes (there is no exact time, since the temperature has fluctuated so much with the oven being opened and closed and the canel\u00e9 spending time, as needed, out of the oven). Watch for the tops to completely turn a deep golden brown and bubble (this is the butter in the batter) around the edges and middle. When the desired color is achieved on the tops, remove one from the oven using the tongs to test. Allow it to cool for several minutes, then invert the mold onto the cooling rack. If you are pleased with the color of the canel\u00e9, then remove the rest from the oven and allow them to cool for several minutes before unmolding. If you are not, return the canel\u00e9 to its mold and bake the batch longer. The canel\u00e9 should cool on the rack for 30 minutes before eating, and are best if consumed no more than 5 hours after baking.</p>"}]}
