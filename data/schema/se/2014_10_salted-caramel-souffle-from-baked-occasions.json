Increase the heat to high, stop stirring, clip on a candy thermometer (making sure the bulb is immersed in the sugar but not touching the pan), and allow the mixture to boil. Once it begins to turn a rich, dark caramel color and the thermometer reads 345F (175C), 5 to 8 minutes (don\u2019t worry if it takes longer, the actual time is reliant on so many factors), remove it from the heat; do not overcook. Gently and slowly stream in the heavy cream (it will bubble up, so be careful). Stir in the fleur de sel. Return the mixture to medium-low heat; don\u2019t worry if the caramel mixture begins to harden\u2014it will easily melt again as it reheats. Add the milk and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low.
