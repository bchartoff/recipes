We'd gorge on spicy braised meats, simmered lentils, and rich stews, all the while scooping up and dipping into the buttery sauces with tangy injera bread. It was messy in the most comforting way. So, I was excited to find a recipe for Ethiopian chicken stew in <strong><a href=\"http://glutenfreegirl.com/about/\">Shauna James Ahern's</a></strong> new cookbook <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Gluten-Free-Every-Shauna-James-Ahern/dp/111811521X/?tag=serieats-20\">Gluten-Free Girl Every Day</a></strong>. Both the stew and the accompanying injera are naturally gluten-free, so they're an obvious inclusion in the book.", "totalTime": "1 hour and 15 minutes", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCategory": ["Chicken", "Cook the Book", "Gluten-Free", "Mains", "Soups and Stews"], "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons clarified butter", "2 medium red onions, peeled and chopped", "2 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced", "One 1 1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced", "1 tablespoon <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/05/shauna-james-aherns-berbere-seasoning.html\">berbere seasoning</a>", "3 whole cloves", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "One 3-pound chicken, cut into breasts, legs, thighs, and wings", "1 large potato (we like to use a purple potato here), peeled and chopped", "1 carrot, peeled and chopped", "1/4 head savoy cabbage, sliced thin", "3 cups chicken stock", "1 lime, juiced", "<a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/05/shauna-james-aherns-injera-ethiopian-flatbrea.html\">Injera bread</a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Set a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
