All too often, however, chow mein comes slick with grease and full of over-cooked chunks of stringy chicken. <strong><a href=\"http://appetiteforchina.com/about/diana-kuan\">Diana Kuan's</a></strong> recipe in <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Chinese-Takeout-Cookbook-Prepare/dp/034552912X/?tag=serieats-20\">The Chinese Takeout Cookbook</a></em> solves these problems with ease. The chicken spends no more than four minutes on the heat, and the oil is reduced to a modest 3 tablespoons (just enough to keep the noodles from fusing to the pan).
