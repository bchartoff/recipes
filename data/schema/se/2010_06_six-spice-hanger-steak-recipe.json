While it's often referred to as a \"cheaper cut,\" I usually can't find it for under $10 a pound. Also, a lot of recipes recommend a long marinade&mdash;something I can't indulge in often. Luckily, I found this recipe from <em><a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Six-Spice-Hanger-Steak-350253\">Gourmet</a></em>, which introduces a highly flavored dry rub and a very simple sauce.
