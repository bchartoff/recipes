Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. When ready to roll, on a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thick, turning often to keep the dough as circular as possible. Place an 8 inch springform pan in the middle of the dough and cut a circle one inch larger than the pan around it. Remove the pan and center the dough in it, smoothing it into the bottom. Don't worry if it tears or folds over itself; the dough is very forgiving and you can patch it as you need to. Make sure you have a nice right angle all the way around the edge and flatten the extra dough against the rim of the pan. Measure with a ruler to be sure it's an inch high all the way around, trimming with a paring knife if necessary. Dock the bottom of the crust with a fork, paring knife of cake tester, then freeze until solid, at least ten minutes.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place the crust in the center of the oven and bake for 10 minutes, then turn and bake for another 5.

Once mixture begins boiling, turn on the timer. Whisk constantly while the mixture boils to cook the cornstarch, being careful not to scorch on the bottom. Once timer goes off, immediately remove from heat and whisk in butter and olive oil. Once incorporated, press through strainer into bowl, discarding the solids.
