As I held the plate, she added more oil to the wok and heated it up until it was almost smoking before slipping an egg into it. Thirty seconds later, it was deposited on my plate with crisp, lacy edges, a tender center, and a runny yolk to mix in with my rice. It was a revelation.", "totalTime": "2 minutes", "recipeYield": "Serves 1", "recipeCategory": ["Breakfast and Brunch", "Fried Eggs", "Mother's Day"], "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable or olive oil", "2 eggs", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oil in a 10-inch cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.
