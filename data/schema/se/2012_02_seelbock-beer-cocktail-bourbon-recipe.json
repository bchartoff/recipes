And most importantly, I used a doppelbock wheat beer in place of the Champagne. If you can't find this brew, substitute any good quality bock or wheat beer. If you can't find lemon bitters, you can muddle lemon peel into the mixing glass before you add the other ingredients.", "totalTime": "5 minutes", "recipeYield": "makes 1 cocktail", "recipeCategory": ["Whiskey"], "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces rye whiskey (I used Rittenhouse)", "1/2 ounces Cointreau", "1/4 ounce lemon bitters (yes, measure!)", "2 dashes Angostura bitters", "4 ounces Aventinus doppelbock", "Garnish: lemon twist"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a mixing glass filled with ice, stir rye, Cointreau, and both bitters.
