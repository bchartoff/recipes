The chef Iliana de la Vega, who was born in Oaxaca, Mexico, served it at a delicious Latin-themed lunch she prepared at the \u201cHealthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives\u201d conference this year at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley. I couldn\u2019t get enough of it. I sat with Iliana at the lunch and asked her about the salad. \u201cJust salt the cabbage, let it sit for a while, then add lots of lemon juice and the mashed avocado,\u201d  she said.  That really is all there is to it. Shred the cabbage thin and for best results let it sit, after salting generously, for an hour or more, to tenderize it and draw out strong-tasting juices.\n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/15recipehealth/15recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 89}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 85, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "163 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 large cabbage, cored and finely shredded (about 1 pound cabbage, which produces 5 cups shredded cabbage)", "Salt to taste", "4 to 5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (more to taste)", "1 large or 1 1/2 medium-size ripe avocados", "Freshly ground pepper (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place shredded cabbage in a large bowl or colander and salt generously.
