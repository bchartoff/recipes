{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Eggs With Kale, Bacon and Cornbread Crumbs", "description": "This Southern riff on bacon and eggs comes together quickly and with just a few ingredients. Using a store-bought corn muffin to make the toasted cornbread crumbs is a quick shortcut that gives this dish its star power. (Try using these crumbs as croutons in a kale Caesar salad, too!) Curly kale, collard greens, Swiss chard or a combination may be used in place of the Tuscan kale. For a vegetarian-friendly version, this recipe can be made without the bacon: Just saut\u00e9 the garlic, onion and greens in 3 tablespoons olive oil, and add an additional 1/2 teaspoon salt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/06/dining/hueck-baked-eggs-with-greens-and-cornbread-crumbs/merlin_154348128_887f1604-e01b-4845-b9db-f259542d1c96-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "bacon, cornbread, eggs, kale, onion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 243}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup large cornbread crumbs (about 4 ounces) from about 1 large corn muffin", "1 teaspoon olive oil", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste", "1 pound Tuscan or lacinato kale (about 2 bunches)", "6 bacon slices (about 6 ounces), cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces (optional)", "1 medium yellow onion, cut in half through the stem and thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons minced garlic (about 2 cloves)", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste", "1/2 cup water or chicken stock", "2 teaspoons white-wine or apple cider vinegar", "6 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
