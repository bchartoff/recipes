{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lobster With Peach Coleslaw", "description": "Although we do not have sweet salads in France, when I came to the United States I fell in love with coleslaw. Unripe peaches are not dripping with juice, but they do have a little peachy flavor and good, firm texture. Cut into julienne strips, they are a perfect replacement for cabbage. The soft texture of the lobster and the crispness of the peaches make a very good balance in a very elegant dish. You could also use saut\u00e9ed scallops because scallops, like lobster, are sweet and tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michel Richard"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2H40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, french", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "ginger, lobster, maple syrup, peach, yogurt, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 352, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "50 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1216 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plain whole-milk yogurt", "2 teaspoons sugar", "Juice of 1/2 small lemon", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger", "4 unripe peaches (1 1/4 pounds), peeled and cut into 1/8-inch julienne strips", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 hard-cooked egg yolk", "2 teaspoons chopped chives", "2 lobsters, 1 to 1 1/2 pounds each", "1 tablespoon maple syrup", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Chervil and curly parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To prepare coleslaw: In a medium bowl, combine yogurt, sugar, lemon juice and ginger.
