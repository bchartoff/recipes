The other important ingredient is bacon fat, which can be old or new, but must be the result of cooked bacon past. Together, with garlic, pepper, onion, chile and tomato, the two become the very rich and appealing base of this dish that is somewhere between a solid and a stew. At the very end, there is an egg, which is filling and enlivening at once.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/02/magazine/02eat2/02eat2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 208}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 280, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "947 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons bacon fat", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil (or you can use all bacon fat)", "4 to 6 dry tortillas, of the kind described as having \u2018\u2018seen better days,\u2019\u2019 quartered", "3 cloves garlic, smashed and chopped", "1/2 medium red onion, chopped small", "1/2 red or yellow pepper, chopped small", "1 to 2 teaspoons coarse salt, to taste", "4 to 4 1/2 cups large chopped fresh or canned tomatoes (no juice if from can)", "1/2 tablespoon pickled spicy chiles, or a few dashes Tabasco or other hot sauce", "4 eggs", "1 full cup cilantro or mint, stems removed, left as leaves", "2 limes", "Grated or crumbled Cheddar or queso blanco (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400.
