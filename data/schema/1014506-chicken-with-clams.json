{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken With Clams", "description": "This is a dish inspired by the classic Portuguese pork with clams (usually called \u00e1 alentejana, because it\u2019s from Alentejo), a magnificent expression of surf and turf, with the brininess of the clams almost overwhelmingly flavoring the pork. Here, it\u2019s done with chicken, which is more reliably tender (good pork is harder to find than good chicken) and marries with the clam juice equally well. It can also be made in a kind of Chinese style, by adding not only ginger to the garlic but also sesame oil and soy sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/02/dining/02MUSSELS1/02MUSSELS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "portuguese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "chicken drumsticks, cilantro, littleneck clam, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 51}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 527, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "59 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "881 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons neutral oil, like\ngrapeseed or safflower", "4 chicken drumsticks or thighs,\nskin on, bone in", "Salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons chopped garlic", "2 tablespoons chopped ginger", "24 littleneck clams, rinsed in several\nchanges of water until water runs clear\nand then drained", "1 bunch scallions, white and green\nparts chopped and separated", "1/4 cup cilantro stems, chopped", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil over medium-high heat\nin a large, deep skillet or broad pot that\ncan later be covered.
