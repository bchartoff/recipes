{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Exciting Noodle Kugel", "description": "This savory kugel, a Jewish baked noodle pudding, comes from a 1950 spiral-bound cookbook that was compiled by the women of a synagogue in suburban Larchmont, N.Y. They called it Exciting Baked Noodles, and it included what were then considered secret ingredients: Worcestershire and Tabasco sauce. To update it, use high-quality pappardelle egg noodles, which add richness. A sprinkling of chives brings flecks of color to the finished casserole.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/01/dining/01ROSH/01ROSH-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, noodles", "keywords": "cottage cheese, egg noodles, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 769}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 350, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "404 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter to grease pan", "8 ounces medium egg noodles, preferably high-quality pappardelle", "1 1/2 cups cottage cheese (with curds, not creamed or whipped) or farmer cheese", "1 1/2 cups sour cream", "1/2 medium onion, finely minced", "1 clove garlic, chopped", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce", "Dash of Tabasco sauce", "1 teaspoon salt, or to taste", "Freshly ground pepper, to taste", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup chives, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
