{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cherry Tomatoes Stuffed With Pesto", "description": "When I lived in Provence, I followed the local custom of setting a couple of pots of basil by my kitchen door to keep the flies away. I\u2019m not sure why it works, but the essential oils in basil \u2014 which make this herb so heavenly, although apparently not to flies \u2014 have been shown to have anti-bacterial properties. A few studies have shown that the oils can inhibit some pathogenic bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics. Basil also contains flavonoids that are believed to have some antioxidant properties; it\u2019s an excellent source of vitamin K, and a very good source of iron, calcium and vitamin A. I\u2019ve been serving these appetizers for decades. You can also make a warm side dish with medium-size tomatoes (see variation below).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/12/science/11recipehealth600/11recipehealth600-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 12 as an hors d\u2019oeuvre, six to eight as a side dish", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, basil, cherry tomatoes, gluten-free, healthy, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 77, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "103 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 or 2 garlic cloves, to taste", "1 1/2 cups fresh basil leaves", "2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds or Mediterranean pine nuts", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1/3 cup (2 1/2 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan", "1 pint cherry tomatoes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the pesto, turn on a food processor fitted with the steel blade, and drop in the garlic.
