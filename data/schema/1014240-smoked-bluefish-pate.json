(Some states have issued advisories limiting its consumption, citing high levels of PCBs in the meat.) The knock on it is it\u2019s oily, it\u2019s \u201cfishy.\u201d Its dark, compact meat is for cats, not fine, upstanding people like us.\n\nHow untrue \u2014 and demonstrably so, as the following recipe will show!\n\nA fresh-caught bluefish of moderate weight, quickly cleaned and kept on ice, is as fine an eating fish as American waters produce. Alan Davidson, the British seafood don, says much the same in his indispensable \u201cNorth Atlantic Seafood,\u201d albeit in a different accent: \u201cIt does not keep very well,\u201d reads Davidson\u2019s entry for Pomatomus saltatrix, \u201cbut, if bought and cooked with dispatch, offers firm flesh of an excellent taste.\u201d Bluefish, in short, is an excellent protein.\n\nSome words about what you\u2019re dealing with: dense meat with an off-white, almost gray hue, the pork shoulder of seafood. Bluefish lends itself to tough treatment: smoking, for instance, or slow-poaching in oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/06/dining/Smoked-Bluefish/Smoked-Bluefish-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "Makes about 1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, bluefish fillet, cream cheese, hickory chips", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup hickory chips, soaked in water for at least 30 minutes", "1/2 pound skin-on bluefish fillets, bones removed", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 pound smoked bluefish (presmoked, grilled or leftovers from the Dijonnaise may be used)", "4 ounces (1/2 cup) cream cheese", "2 tablespoons butter", "1 tablespoon Cognac", "1 tablespoon minced red onion", "1 lemon", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "Hot pepper sauce", "Crackers", "sliced baguette or pumpernickel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To smoke bluefish: Build a small charcoal fire in one-third of a grill fitted with a lid.
