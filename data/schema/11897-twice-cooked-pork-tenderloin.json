Brown the whole tenderloin. Let it rest for a few minutes, so the meat firms up a bit. Then slice the tenderloin into medallions, about an inch thick. Brown the slices on both sides and top with a quick French-style sauce made of heavy cream and Dijon mustard, lemon juice or Calvados.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/09/dining/09COOKING-PORKTENDERLOIN1/09COOKING-PORKTENDERLOIN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "gluten-free, low-carb, main course, pork, pork tenderloin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1397}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 301, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "331 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 boneless pork tenderloin, about 1 pound", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons butter, extra virgin olive oil, or a combination", "1/4 cup cream", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, lemon juice or Calvados, optional", "Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper.
