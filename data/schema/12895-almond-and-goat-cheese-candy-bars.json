{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Almond and Goat Cheese Candy Bars", "description": "In today\u2019s locavore, organic-minded, food-crazed culture, we get so wrapped up in the idea of seasonal fruits and vegetables that it can be easy to forget another important, deep vein of seasonal foodstuff opportunities.\n\nThat is, candy. Because I wasn\u2019t trying to make child-friendly crowd pleasers here, I had the freedom to pull out ingredients that would not normally appear in a candy bowl.  And because these candy bars are savory-sweet, as opposed to cloying sweet, I can eat more of them before my teeth start to ache.\n\nIt\u2019s important to use a mild, soft goat cheese here. You want a slight tang but not an overwhelming barnyard flavor. And if you really dislike the funkiness of goat cheese, you can use cream cheese instead. The candy will be sweeter and not as complex tasting, but the recipe will still work.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/09/dining/candybar/candybar-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "18 bars", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "almond butter, chocolate, goat cheese, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 390}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 195, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "34 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, softened", "25 grams sliced almonds (about 1/3 cup)", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "3/4 cup smooth almond butter", "2 tablespoons softened goat cheese", "55 grams almond flour (about 1/2 cup)", "195 grams confectioner\u2019s sugar (about 1 1/2 cups)", "4 ounces bittersweet (72 percent) chocolate, coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a small skillet over medium heat.
