{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kentucky Butter Cake", "description": "If you think you don\u2019t need another Bundt cake recipe, this one exists to prove you wrong. Adapted from Nell Lewis of Platte City, Mo., who entered the Pillsbury Bake-Off contest in 1963, it is a favorite of food bloggers and Pinterest lovers alike. On the surface, it\u2019s not that different from your typical pound cake, but what makes it special is a vanilla-scented, buttery sugar glaze that\u2019s poured over the still-warm cake. Left to sit for several hours before unmolding, the glaze soaks into the cake, making it incredibly tender and rich while leaving behind a delightful sugary crust. There are a lot of variations out there \u2014 some with bourbon in place of the vanilla, others with sherry \u2014 so feel free to play around.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/27/dining/ml-butter-cake/ml-butter-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "butter, buttermilk, flour, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 656}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), softened, plus more for greasing the pan", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose unbleached flour, plus more for dusting the pan", "Nonstick cooking spray (optional)", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk (see Tip)", "4 eggs", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/75 grams unsalted butter", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
