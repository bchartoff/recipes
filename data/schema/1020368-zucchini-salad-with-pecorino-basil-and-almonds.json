Cutting zucchini into thicker batons helps the vegetable retain some bite. Douse the strips with a bright garlic-caper vinaigrette, tender herbs and tangy pecorino, and just before serving, toss in some chopped almonds for crunch. This zucchini salad makes a great starter or a side, but it can also be the foundation of a meal: Add it to cooked penne or pearl couscous for a quick pasta salad, or scatter it over a slice of grilled bread that\u2019s been slathered with mascarpone or ricotta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/22/dining/aw-zucchini-salad/merlin_158023398_b353ff37-aa49-4a2a-be49-3f3df1b9cc50-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, for two, lunch, quick, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "almond, basil, capers, lemon, parsley, pecorino romano, shallot, zucchini, fall, summer, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 458}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small shallot, minced (about 2 tablespoons)", "2 tablespoons capers, chopped, plus 2 teaspoons caper brine", "1 teaspoon lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon juice", "1 garlic clove, minced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 medium zucchini or summer squash (6 to 7 ounces each)", "1/3 cup shaved Pecorino-Romano cheese", "1/4 cup torn fresh basil", "1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1/3 cup roasted salted almonds, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, stir together the oil, shallot, capers, caper brine, lemon zest, lemon juice and garlic.
