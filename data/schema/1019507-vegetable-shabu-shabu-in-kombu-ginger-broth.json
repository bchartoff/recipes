But the secret weapon is the grated ginger stirred in at the end. The raw ginger keeps the broth fresh and bright. Kombu is rich in valuable minerals and vitamins, so don\u2019t waste it; once the broth is made, chop the kombu and add it back to the pot. The nice chewy texture and mushroomy flavor play well with the daikon and tofu.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/dining/shabu-shabu/shabu-shabu-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, one pot, vegetables", "keywords": "bok choy, daikon, kombu, mushroom, tofu, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 99}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 204, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "805 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons canola oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "1/2 cup finely chopped scallions", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 ounce kombu (dried kelp)", "2 tablespoons peeled, grated ginger", "Kosher salt", "1/2 pound daikon, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch-thick", "6 ounces white button mushrooms, halved\u00a0(about 2 cups)", "1 pound baby bok choy, trimmed and leaves separated", "1 pound firm tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes", "1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar", "2 tablespoons finely chopped scallions", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "1/2 teaspoon grated garlic", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the shabu shabu: Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.
