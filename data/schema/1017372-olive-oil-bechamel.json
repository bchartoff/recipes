{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Olive Oil B\u00e9chamel", "description": "Here, a classic French sauce, revisited. Make sure the milk is cold or at room temperature. If the liquid is too hot, the roux won\u2019t have time to properly disperse in the liquid before the mixture comes to a boil; this is what causes sauces to lump.\n\nThe main thing to watch for here is scorching. Stir often with a rubber spatula, especially at the bottom and edges of the pan, so that the mixture doesn\u2019t stick and begin to burn. If it does, immediately pour the sauce into another pot and continue to cook over very low heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "extra virgin olive oil, flour, milk, shallot", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 84}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 168, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "413 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot or onion (optional)", "2 tablespoons flour", "2 cups low-fat (1 percent) milk", "Salt to taste", "Freshly ground white or black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil over medium heat in a heavy medium saucepan.
