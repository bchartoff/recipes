{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orecchiette With Fresh and Dried Beans and Tomatoes", "description": "Once the beans are done, this pasta dish takes only 15 minutes. Orecchiette is a great pasta to use with beans, which lodge in the hollows of the little ears. I used lush Good Mother Stallard beans, an heirloom bean that I ordered from Rancho Gordo for this dish, but you can substitute supermarket pinto or borlottis. Cook them simply and use some of the broth for the sauce. If you have marinara sauce on hand you can use that; otherwise take advantage of the tomatoes arriving in farmers\u2019 markets and your garden, and chop up a few of them. No need to cook them if you don\u2019t want to.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/01/science/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 8}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 290, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "603 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound (about 1 1/2 cups) Good Mother Stallard Beans, pintos, or borlottis, rinsed and soaked for 4 hours or overnight in 1 quart water", "1/2 large onion, or 1 small onion, cut in half or quartered", "2 to 3 large garlic cloves, minced", "Salt to taste", "1 cup marinara sauce (using fresh or canned tomatoes), or 1 cup finely chopped fresh tomatoes", "1/2 pound orecchiette", "1/2 pound green beans, broken into 2- or 3-inch lengths", "Slivered fresh basil leaves (about 2 tablespoons)", "Freshly grated Parmesan for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To cook dried beans, transfer with their soaking water to a heavy pot.
