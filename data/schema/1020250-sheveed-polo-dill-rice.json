{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheveed Polo (Dill Rice)", "description": "This dish is a simple way to make use of a whole bunch of dill and transform an ordinary pot of plain rice. Naz Deravian, the author of \u201cBottom of the Pot: Persian Recipes and Stories\u201d (Flatiron Books, 2018), uses a mix of fresh and dried dill here. The dried dill enhances the fragrance and also draws out the humidity from the fresh dill so the rice doesn\u2019t turn mushy when steaming. This recipe uses a traditional Persian technique for cooking rice in which you boil the rice for several minutes over high heat, wrap the lid in a kitchen towel to catch the condensation, then steam the rice over low heat for several minutes more. Don't worry; it won't be overcooked. It will be fluffy perfection. Serve it with chicken or seafood, like this <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020253\">roasted dill salmon</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/dining/nd-sheveed-polo/merlin_154348143_542cc6cf-4c27-4692-bcea-6be80dc7e7ef-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "basmati rice, dill, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 193}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large bunch dill, trimmed and finely chopped", "3 tablespoons dried dill", "2 cups white basmati rice, rinsed", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter or olive oil", "2 teaspoons kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set aside 1/4 cup of the chopped fresh dill.
