Be sure to add 1 teaspoon of coarsely ground fresh cardamom with the flour in Step 1 of the Danish dough. (Grind it yourself using a grinder or mortar and pestle; the coarse grind allows the spice to permeate the dough, but not in an aggressive way. If you use pre-ground cardamom, you will likely need less.) The apricot glaze adds a festive shine to the finished pastry, but it is not essential.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/23/dining/23JPDANISH2/23JPDANISH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastries, project", "keywords": "bosc pear, raw almond", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 70}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 135, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "104 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons/71 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons/30 grams packed light or dark brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 cups/380 grams diced pear (from 2 to 3 firm Bosc pears)", "1/3 cup/52 grams raw almonds", "3 tablespoons/21 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 large egg yolk", "1/8 teaspoon almond extract", "1 batch Danish dough with cardamom added (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017897-danish-dough\">see recipe</a>)", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "1/4 cup/80 grams apricot preserves, for glaze (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To prepare the pear filling, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
