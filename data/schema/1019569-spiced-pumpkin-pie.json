{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Pumpkin Pie", "description": "Most pumpkin pies rely entirely on ground spices for their heady flavor. In this one, whole spices (star anise, clove, cinnamon and black peppercorns) are infused into cream, which gives it a more interesting, nuanced character, while a hit of ground ginger added at the end makes it particularly intense. You can make the filling and par-bake the crust the day before, but this pie is best assembled and baked on the day you plan to serve it. If you can, use a high-fat, European-style butter for the crust. It really makes a difference.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/07/dining/07pierex1/merlin_144440784_303ef02e-67eb-4257-a31f-0d6fd4f85c49-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, fall, ginger, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, rum, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 366}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 467, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "234 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "10 tablespoons/140 grams unsalted butter, chilled and cubed", "2 to 4 tablespoons ice water, as needed", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 cinnamon stick", "2 petals from a star-anise pod (not the whole pod)", "1 whole clove", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon cardamom pods", "1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "1 3/4 cups pumpkin or butternut squash pur\u00e9e (homemade or from a 15-ounce can)", "3/4 cup/165 grams dark brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "2 large egg yolks", "2 tablespoons dark rum", "2 teaspoons ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.
