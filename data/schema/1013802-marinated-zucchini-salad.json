I like to use a mixture of green and yellow squash here. Assemble this dish at least four hours before you wish to serve it, so that the squash has time to soften and soak up the lemony marinade.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/17/health/17recipehealth/17recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H40M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "healthy, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 204}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 116, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "317 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound medium or small zucchini, preferably a mix of green and yellow", "Salt to taste", "3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 garlic clove, crushed", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley, mint, chives, dill or a combination"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice the squash as thinly as you can.
