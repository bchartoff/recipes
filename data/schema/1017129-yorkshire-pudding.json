{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Yorkshire Pudding", "description": "This recipe is from the British-born chef April Bloomfield, who says it dates back to an era when an English pub might cook a hunk of meat by dangling it from a hook above a roaring fire. The \u201cpudding\u201d emerged from a pan full of runny batter that would have been placed beneath the meat to soak up the juices. \u201cThe heat of the fire would make the Yorkshire pudding rise up, and all the fat would seep in,\u201d she said. (Life back then was \u201cnasty, brutish, and short,\u201d as Thomas Hobbes once griped, but apparently there were upsides.) Of course, making Yorkshire pudding these days is a more domesticated undertaking. \u201cNow what happens is you kind of recreate that,\u201d said Ms. Bloomfield, who serves it as part of an order-ahead prime-rib feast at the Breslin Bar & Dining Room in the Ace Hotel in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s very soulful,\u201d she said. \u201cGive me 10 Yorkshire puddings and a thin sliver of beef, and I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/14/dining/14PRIMEREX/14PRIMEREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "12 puddings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, breads", "keywords": "beef fat, egg, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 732}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 65, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "90 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large eggs", "3/4 cup/165 grams whole milk", "3/4 cup/115 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon/5 grams kosher salt", "About 1/4 cup rendered beef or pork fat, olive oil or melted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
