The season continues through summer, but is at its best in June. The year\u2019s first wild salmon has brilliant red flesh, a mild sweet flavor and a velvety texture. Farmed salmon doesn\u2019t compare. You pay a high price for wild salmon, but the splurge is worth it. Paired with bright green chive oil and limey cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, it will make you swoon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/12/dining/07kitchenrex/07kitchenrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "chives, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, lime, salmon, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 154}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6-ounce) pieces wild king salmon fillet", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and pepper", "1 cup roughly chopped chives, plus 2 tablespoons thinly sliced chives, for garnish", "3/4 cup grapeseed oil or another neutral oil, such as safflower", "1 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "Zest and juice of 1 small lime", "Chive blossoms or other edible blossoms (optional)", "Watercress sprigs or other peppery greens, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
