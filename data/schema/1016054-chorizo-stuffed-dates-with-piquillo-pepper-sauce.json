{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chorizo-Stuffed Dates With Piquillo Pepper Sauce", "description": "Adapted from Perry Hendrix, the chef de cuisine at the acclaimed restaurant Avec in Chicago, these intensely flavored mouthfuls are meaty, spicy and sweet all at once. You could serve them as an appetizer, sitting in a pool of silky sauce, but they could also work as finger food, with the sauce set aside for dipping. Make sure to buy uncured, fresh chorizo sausage rather than the salami-like cured kind. Specialty stores generally carry jars of piquillo peppers, but if you can\u2019t find them, substitute any roasted red peppers for the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/19/dining/19TAKEAWAY_SPAN/19TAKEAWAY_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "5 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, chorizo, dates", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 104}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 739, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "83 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "992 milligrams", "sugarContent": "63 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon olive oil", "8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "8 shallots, thinly sliced", "8 ounces (about 1 cup) roasted piquillo peppers with any juices (or use any roasted red peppers)", "2 cups whole peeled canned tomatoes", "Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste", "16 Medjool dates (pitted)", "8 ounces of fresh chorizo sausage (not cured), casings removed", "8 slices bacon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
