{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mozzarella in Carrozza (Fried Mozzarella Sandwiches)", "description": "This Italian snack is essentially a mozzarella stick in sandwich form: Mozzarella cheese tucked inside plush bread, crusted with bread crumbs (use panko for extra crunch) and fried. In parts of Italy, you might also find anchovies, 'nduja or prosciutto in it, or marinara sauce or pesto served alongside for dipping. But gooey cheese in every bite? That's guaranteed: According to the food writer Emiko Davies, it\u2019s called mozzarella en carrozza, or mozzarella in carriage, because the strands of melted mozzarella that pull from the sandwich resemble the reins of a horse and carriage. For best results, skip the fresh mozzarella and look for low-moisture mozzarella \u2014 the kind found sealed in plastic without liquid in your supermarket's dairy section. And try to set out your ingredients just before you begin: It'll help the process go more smoothly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/dining/as-mozzarella-en-carrozza/as-mozzarella-en-carrozza-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weekday, sandwiches", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bread crumbs, mozzarella, white bread, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 325}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 962, "unsaturatedFatContent": "41 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "67 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "1250 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 eggs", "1 large garlic clove, minced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup bread crumbs (preferably panko)", "8 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed", "1 pound low-moisture mozzarella (not fresh mozzarella), chilled and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "Olive oil, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs, then beat in the garlic, season with salt and pepper and beat again to combine.
