{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Burst Cherry Tomatoes", "description": "This recipe may seem like it calls for a lot of mint, but that\u2019s what makes this easy pasta dish so refreshing. Cooking halved cherry tomatoes in olive oil until they burst condenses their flavor and caramelizes their edges, and makes a very intense base for the pasta sauce in this dish. Pancetta adds richness and a salty tang, but if you\u2019d rather leave it out, you can. Just toss in some grated pecorino cheese at the end along with the butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/20/dining/mc-pasta-with-burst-cherry-tomatoes/mc-pasta-with-burst-cherry-tomatoes-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, fusilli, scallion, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1367}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 501, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "668 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fusilli pasta", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "6 ounces pancetta, preferably thick cut, diced", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "Pinch of red pepper flakes", "Fine sea salt and black pepper, as needed", "1 quart cherry or grape tomatoes, halved", "3 tablespoons butter", "Fresh ricotta cheese, for serving (optional)", "3 cups whole mint leaves, torn", "4 scallions, preferably red scallions for color, thinly sliced", "Flaky sea salt, to finish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil.
