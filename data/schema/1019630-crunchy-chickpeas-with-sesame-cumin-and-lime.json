{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy Chickpeas With Sesame, Cumin and Lime", "description": "It's a bit more work than just tossing chickpeas, oil and spices together onto a sheet pan, but dry-roasting the beans first, then stirring them into oil that's been infused with spices encourages the seasoning to cling to the bean. Here, nutty sesame seeds are combined with earthy cumin before being tossed with roasted chickpeas and a little lime zest for brightness. They make a nice addition to a charcuterie plate or as a topping for roasted vegetables such as carrots or baby turnips. They also make a great high-protein snack for kids of all ages.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/28/dining/ch-chickpea-cumin-lime/ch-chickpea-cumin-lime-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "beans", "keywords": "appetizer, chickpea, cumin, lime zest, sesame seeds, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 106}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 216, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "269 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and patted very dry", "1 1/2 teaspoons sesame seeds", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 teaspoon cumin", "2 teaspoons lime zest", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
