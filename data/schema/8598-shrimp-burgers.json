{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp Burgers", "description": "You can make a burger out of anything, as most home cooks know; the challenge is in choosing a central element that delivers superior flavor and texture. Shrimp, like scallops, contain a high amount of natural gelatin, which allows you to incorporate a considerable amount of flavorings without worrying about the burger falling apart. \n\nIf you pur\u00e9e just a portion of the shrimp, leaving the rest \u2014 along with the flavorings \u2014 just roughly chopped, you produce a good-textured burger with powerful flavor. Feel free to vary the heat, reducing or increasing the amount of chile. And as with any burgers, these can be seasoned pretty much according to your whim.\n\nNo grill? Go ahead and pan-fry these burgers with a little bit of oil over medium-high heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/19/dining/19COOKING-BURGER2/19COOKING-BURGER2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, project", "keywords": "bell pepper, cilantro, shrimp, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 445}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 170, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "967 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large clove garlic, peeled", "1 dried or fresh chile, stemmed, seeded and deveined, or more to taste", "1 1-inch piece ginger, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 1/2 pounds peeled shrimp, deveined if you like", "1/4 cup roughly chopped shallots, scallions or red onion", "1/4 cup roughly chopped red or yellow bell pepper, optional", "Salt and pepper", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves, or to taste", "Neutral oil, like corn or canola, as needed", "Toasted buns, optional", "Lime wedges or ketchup for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start a charcoal or gas grill; fire should be moderately hot and rack about 4 inches from heat source."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine garlic, chili, ginger and 1/3 of the shrimp in a food processor and pur\u00e9e, stopping machine to scrape down sides of container as necessary.
