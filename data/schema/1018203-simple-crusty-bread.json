It quickly became (and remains) one of our most popular recipes because it made bakery-quality bread a real possibility for home cooks. But then we heard about Jeff Hertzberg, a physician from Minneapolis, who devised a streamlined technique for a crusty loaf of bread. Mix flour, salt, yeast and water. Let it sit a bit, refrigerate it, take some out and let it rise, then bake it. The crusty, full-flavored loaf that results may be the world\u2019s easiest yeast bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nick Fox"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/08/insider/simple-crusty-bread/simple-crusty-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H45M", "recipeYield": "4 loaves", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2440}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons yeast", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt", "6 1/2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour, more for dusting dough", "Cornmeal"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl or plastic container, mix yeast and salt into 3 cups lukewarm water (about 100 degrees).
