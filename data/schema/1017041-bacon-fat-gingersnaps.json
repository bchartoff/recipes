(Not many of us food writers are also sleek fashion plates, so her kitchen prowess is all the more impressive.) This recipe is based on <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1848-swedish-ginger-cookies\" target=\"_blank\">Swedish ginger cookies</a>, a Scandinavian-American tradition in her hometown, Coshocton, Ohio, but it is also the cookie equivalent of a Chanel suit: updated, modern, but ultimately a familiar take on a classic. \nThe flavors are truly remarkable, with a robust and smoky-salty undertone that sets these apart from other gingersnaps. Make bacon for breakfast a couple of weekends in a row, strain the fat into a container, and refrigerate: you\u2019ll soon save up enough for a double batch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/03/dining/03COOKFIGHTREX7/03COOKFIGHTREX7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "american, scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "bacon fat, ginger, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 596}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 80, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "69 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/150 grams rendered bacon fat (from cooking 1 1/2 to 2 pounds bacon), chilled", "1 cup/200 grams white sugar, plus extra for rolling", "1/4 cup/85 grams molasses or cane syrup", "1 egg", "2 cups/250 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons/8 grams kosher salt", "2 teaspoons/10 grams baking soda", "2 teaspoons/10 grams ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
