{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork-Shoulder Steaks With Hot Pepper Dip", "description": "This is pork barbecue as you\u2019ve probably never experienced it, with the shoulder cut crosswise into pencil-thin steaks and grilled directly over hickory embers. Note we're saying grilled, not barbecued (smoked), the way most pork shoulder is cooked in the South. But it\u2019s not complete until it's dipped in a fiery bath of vinegar, melted lard or butter, and cayenne. And no one makes it better than Anita Hamilton Bartlett at R&S Barbecue in Tompkinsville, Ky. To be strictly authentic, you\u2019d grill over a wood fire; barring that, add hickory or other hardwood chunks or chips to your charcoal fire, or place wood chunks under the grate and over the burners of your gas grill. An added advantage: this is \u201cbarbecue\u201d you can cook in 15 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/24/dining/24Porkrex1/merlin_145120956_4b8cdee1-9c46-4665-a190-d36f497968cf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "steaks and chops", "keywords": "lard, pork shoulder steaks, white vinegar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 quart distilled white vinegar", "1/2 pound salted butter (2 sticks)", "1/2 pound lard (or butter)", "2 tablespoons kosher salt, or to taste", "2 tablespoons cayenne pepper (3 if you like your dip really fiery)", "2 tablespoons ground black pepper (3 if you like your dip really fiery)", "1 tablespoon yellow mustard (optional)", "1 tablespoon ketchup (optional)", "Vegetable oil, for the grill", "2 pounds bone-in pork-shoulder steaks (3/4-inch thick)", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dip: Place the ingredients in a deep pot along with 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat until the butter and lard are melted, whisking to dissolve the salt, about 10 minutes.
