The first step is to brown the cut-up chicken well on all sides. Saute the onions, garlic, green peppers and diced ham; then add the tomatoes, saffron, bay leaf and chicken broth. When the mixture comes to a boil, the rice, capers, olives and chicken are added. The dish cooks, covered tightly, in 20 minutes. To get the most authentic flavor, use high-quality saffron threads.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/15/dining/pf-arroz-con-pollo/merlin_150673023_0b72b4b1-e7ae-41e8-8f92-9e11b6151b2c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "chicken, rice, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 531}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3 1/2-pound chicken, cut into 10 serving pieces", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic", "1 large green pepper, cored, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1/4 pound boneless smoked ham, cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "1 1/2 cups canned crushed tomatoes", "4 ripe plum tomatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes", "1/2 teaspoon saffron threads", "1 bay leaf", "3 cups fresh or canned chicken broth", "1 cup converted rice", "1 tablespoon drained capers", "12 green olives stuffed with pimentos", "1 9-ounce package frozen green peas", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese", "1 6 1/2-ounce can fancy pimentos, cut into 8 long strips", "4 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh coriander or parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the chicken with salt, pepper, cumin and oregano."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
