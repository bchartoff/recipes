They&rsquo;re quick to mix together and very easy to roll out. &ldquo;Healthy\u201d crackers can be hard and dry, but this week&rsquo;s offerings are not. I use olive oil in all of them, and some work best with a small amount of butter. I&rsquo;ve been making sesame crackers for decades, tweaking my recipe over the years.
