{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Old-Fashioned Strawberry Cake", "description": "If strawberry doughnuts are your thing, then this cake is absolutely your thing. A classic, old-fashioned buttermilk cake with bits of berries strewn throughout, it manages to taste just like your favorite fried treat (without the frying, of course). Be sure to bake the cake all the way through; strawberries have a high water content and tend to make for a soggy cake if not baked properly. The top should be crackly, deeply and perfectly golden brown, and the edges should pull away from the sides of the pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/14/dining/13Romanrex2/13Romanrex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, spring, summer, strawberries", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 215}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), softened, plus more for pan", "2 cups/255 grams\u00a0all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4\u00a0teaspoon kosher salt", "1/3 cup/70 grams granulated sugar", "1/3\u00a0cup/75 grams\u00a0light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters buttermilk", "10 ounces/190 grams strawberries, hulled and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "3 tablespoons demerara sugar, for sprinkling (you can use granulated sugar in a pinch)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
