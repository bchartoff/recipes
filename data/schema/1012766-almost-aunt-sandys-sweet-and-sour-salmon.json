{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Almost Aunt Sandy\u2019s Sweet and Sour Salmon", "description": "All my other relatives served gefilte fish at holiday meals, but not Aunt Sandy. Instead of breaking the fast on Yom Kippur with gefilte fish, kugel and bagels and lox, she made potage Parmentier, pesto pasta salad and, her masterpiece, sweet and sour fish in a shimmering aspic.\n\nIn my version, I reduced sugar and substituted balsamic for the sharper wine vinegar. I added raisins and sliced lemons, an idea stolen from a similar recipe I found online. I eliminated the peppercorns, which were unpleasant to crunch, adding aromatic thyme instead.\n\nFinally, because I didn\u2019t want aspic, I substituted prepared fish broth for the mess of boiling bones. The broth was light and refreshing with a gentle acidity that was balanced by the sweetness of the raisins. And the fish was succulent and rich and suffused with flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/06/dining/Sweet-and-Sour-Salmon/Sweet-and-Sour-Salmon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "8 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 104}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 207, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "708 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups fish broth", "3 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 bay leaf", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "1 small red onion, thinly sliced", "1/2 bunch thyme", "8 center-cut skin-on wild salmon fillets, 3 ounces each", "1/2 cup golden raisins", "1 small lemon, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup balsamic vinegar", "2 tablespoons light brown sugar", "Challah, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
