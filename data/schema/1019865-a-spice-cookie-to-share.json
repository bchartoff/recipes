{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "A Spice Cookie to Share", "description": "The only thing better than a plate of cookies is one big cookie meant to be shared by everyone around the table. It\u2019s the kind of dessert that will encourage your friends and family to linger at the table and to keep the conversation going. It\u2019s a brown-sugar cookie redolent of ginger, honey, cinnamon and clove that carries the scent of the season and tacks between crisp and slightly chewy, between gingersnap and gingerbread. That it has ground coffee in it marks it as a sweet for grown-ups. It\u2019s a roll-out cookie, but not a fussy one \u2013 any shape works and ragged is better than perfect. I usually sprinkle the cookie with sanding sugar, but you can drizzle it with melted chocolate or frost it, if you\u2019d like. For extra fun, put out chocolate or caramel sauce (or both) and invite everyone to dip.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/23/magazine/23mag-ondessert-image2/23mag-ondessert-image2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "coffee, honey, whole-wheat flour, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 290, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "87 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups (170 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup (68 grams) whole-wheat flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coffee", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "3/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 stick plus 1 tablespoon (4 1/2 ounces; 128 grams) cold, unsalted butter, cut into small pieces", "1/2 cup packed (100 grams) brown sugar", "1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large egg", "1 tablespoon honey", "Sanding sugar, for sprinkling (optional)", "Chocolate or caramel sauce, homemade or store-bought, for dipping (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together the flours, coffee and spices; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Working with a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a hand mixer), mix the pieces of cold butter, both sugars and the salt on low speed for about 3 minutes, until the mixture forms clumps and then comes together.
