{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Egg Noodles With Soy Broth", "description": "This is a tasty, fast, cheap, infinitely variable broth-and-noodle combination. Its preparation is slowed down only by waiting for the water to boil. A key ingredient is ketchup; if you can\u2019t bear that thought, you can use tomato paste instead. There\u2019s also Sriracha, soy sauce, vinegar and sesame oil, all of which add character. The noodles I use are fresh egg pasta, but just about any kind of noodle can be used. Once you\u2019ve made this once, you\u2019ll probably want to take it to a showier place. Cook thinly sliced shallot, ginger or garlic in a little peanut oil before adding the water for the \u201cbroth,\u201d or add sliced celery, bean sprouts, snow peas or sliced carrots to it. Switch to rice noodles, soba, ordinary dried pasta or mung bean threads if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/dining/egg-noodle/egg-noodle-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "egg noodles, ketchup, soy sauce, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 18, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "48 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1/3 cup soy sauce, more to taste", "1/3 cup ketchup or 3 tablespoons tomato paste", "Pinch of sugar", "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar, more to taste", "A few drops dark sesame oil (optional)", "A squirt of Sriracha or other sauce, or a dried red chile to taste optional", "1 pound egg noodles, preferably fresh"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it.
