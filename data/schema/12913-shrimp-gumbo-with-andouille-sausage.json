{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp Gumbo with Andouille Sausage", "description": "Most cooks agree that gumbos must have the vegetable trinity of chopped bell pepper, onion and celery, and that they should be highly seasoned. Some gumbos do contain sausage, shrimp and chicken, but there are humbler ones that are made with only salt pork, onions and greens. Finally, there is the fil\u00e9 powder camp. These cooks use copious amounts of the stuff, which is made from finely powdered sassafras leaves. Added at the last minute, it thickens the soup while imparting a flavor that\u2019s earthy and herbal. I confess to using all three \u2014 a roux, okra and fil\u00e9 powder \u2014 in my own gumbo, which I hope is not sacrilegious. Not having grown up in gumbo territory, I based mine on a number of visits to New Orleans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/16/dining/recipes-shrimpgumbo/recipes-shrimpgumbo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun, creole", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "dairy-free, fall, winter, main course, okra, sausage, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 790}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 384, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1160 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound medium shrimp in the shell", "Salt and pepper", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme", "6 garlic cloves, minced", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 cups diced onion", "1 cup diced red or green bell pepper", "1/2 cup diced celery", "4 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 teaspoon paprika", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne", "1 cup diced ripe tomato, fresh or canned", "6 ounces smoked andouille sausage, in 1-inch-thick slices", "6 cups <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12914-shrimp-broth\">shrimp broth</a> or chicken broth", "2 cups chopped okra", "1 tablespoon fil\u00e9 powder", "1/2 cup chopped scallions for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel and devein shrimp.
