{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Barbecue Chicken Pizza", "description": "This simple recipe celebrates a 1980s classic invented by the American pizza genius Ed LaDou (whose fingerprints are also on Wolfgang Puck\u2019s famous smoked-salmon pizza). The pizza matches the flavors of chicken with barbecue sauce, red onion, two kinds of cheese and a little cilantro. Use homemade dough and barbecue sauce, cook it in the hottest setting of your oven, and the classic pie goes from good to great. Want to make the recipe vegetarian? Simply substitute mushrooms for the chicken and saut\u00e9 until most of their moisture is evaporated.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/06/magazine/06mag-eat-image2/06mag-eat-image2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 12-inch pizzas", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pizza and calzones", "keywords": "barbecue sauce, chicken, mozzarella, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 123}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 ounces chicken breast or boneless, skinless thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce", "2 17-ounce balls pizza dough <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016230-robertas-pizza-dough\">(see recipe)</a>", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, roughly sliced", "1/2 red onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices", "2 ounces Gouda, roughly grated", "A few sprigs fresh cilantro, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 500.
