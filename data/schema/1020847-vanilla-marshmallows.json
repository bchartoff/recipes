When you make this recipe by Christine Moore of Little Flower Candy Co., you get puffs that are soft, tender, languidly stretchy and delicately sweet, and a lesson in the transformative power of heat and air. To make these, you beat together roiling-hot sugar syrup and gelatin, and watch as the mixture goes from murky to opaque, from beige to white, from thin to billowing. For this magic to happen, it takes almost 15 minutes, plus a very large bowl and a sturdy mixer. (I use a 5-quart stand mixer.) You need no special skills, just patience \u2014 you have to wait a few hours for the whipped mixture to dry \u2014 but you\u2019ll be rewarded with singular sweets good for toasting, s\u2019mores, snacking and wrapping up as gifts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/09/magazine/09mag-eat-02/09mag-eat-02-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "48 marshmallows", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, candies", "keywords": "corn syrup, gelatin, vanilla bean, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 248}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters cold water", "6 (1/4-ounce) packets unflavored powdered gelatin (about 1/4 cup/40 grams total)", "2 1/2 cups/500 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/240 milliliters light corn syrup", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped (or 1 more teaspoon vanilla extract)", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1/2 cup/65 grams cornstarch", "1/2 cup/60 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour 3/4 cup/180 milliliters cold water into the bowl of a stand mixer.
