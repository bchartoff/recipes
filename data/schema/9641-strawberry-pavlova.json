Then to serve it, drizzle the strawberries with a little balsamic vinegar and vanilla (a combination that brings out the fullest essential flavor of the fruit), whip some cream and arrange it all on a plate.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and draw a circle on the paper using an 8- or 9- inch cake pan as a guide.
