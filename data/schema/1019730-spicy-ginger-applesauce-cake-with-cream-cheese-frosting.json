{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Ginger Applesauce Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting", "description": "This simple sheet cake is packed with three kinds of spicy ginger: fresh, ground and crystallized. The cake is delicious on its own, but cream cheese frosting and a sprinkle of crystallized ginger push it closer to dessert. The cake can be made a day in advance, covered and refrigerated and brought to room temperature before serving. The crystallized ginger should be sprinkled on just before serving as it will weep in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/dining/ya-ginger-apple-sheetcake/ya-ginger-apple-sheetcake-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "\u00a012 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "candied ginger, cream cheese, ginger, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 103}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/275 grams\u00a0light brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "2 cups/480 milliliters unsweetened applesauce", "3/4 cup/180 grams neutral oil like canola or grapeseed", "2 tablespoons fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated", "1 tablespoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 cup/85 grams finely chopped\u00a0crystallized\u00a0ginger", "12 ounces/350 grams cream cheese, softened", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter, softened", "2 1/4 cups/226 grams\u00a0confectioners' sugar, sifted", "1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated", "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1/2 cup/85 grams finely chopped\u00a0crystallized ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
