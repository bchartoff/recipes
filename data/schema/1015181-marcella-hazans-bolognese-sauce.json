Many people answered with one word: \u201cBolognese.\u201d Ms. Hazan had a few recipes for the classic sauce, and they are all outstanding. This one appeared in her book \u201cThe Essentials of Classic Italian Cuisine,\u201d and one reader called it \u201cthe gold standard.\u201d Try it and see for yourself.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/27/dining/ElCerrito_ThePasta2/ElCerrito_ThePasta2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "2 heaping cups, for about 6 servings and 1 1/2 pounds pasta", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "ground beef, pasta, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 6741}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "3 tablespoons butter plus 1 tablespoon for tossing the pasta", "1/2 cup chopped onion", "2/3 cup chopped celery", "2/3 cup chopped carrot", "3/4 pound ground beef chuck (or you can use 1 part pork to 2 parts beef)", "Salt", "Black pepper, ground fresh from the mill", "1 cup whole milk", "Whole nutmeg", "1 cup dry white wine", "1 1/2 cups canned imported Italian plum tomatoes, cut up, with their juice", "1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds pasta", "Freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese at the table"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the oil, butter and chopped onion in the pot and turn the heat on to medium.

When the tomatoes begin to bubble, turn the heat down so that the sauce cooks at the laziest of simmers, with just an intermittent bubble breaking through to the surface. Cook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more, stirring from time to time. While the sauce is cooking, you are likely to find that it begins to dry out and the fat separates from the meat. To keep it from sticking, add 1/2 cup of water whenever necessary. At the end, however, no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce. Taste and correct for salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss with cooked drained pasta, adding the tablespoon of butter, and serve with freshly grated Parmesan on the side."}]}
