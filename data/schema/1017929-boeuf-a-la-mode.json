As befits a thing that humans have been eating since before computers, before cars, before guns \u2014 perhaps before science itself \u2014 boeuf \u00e0 la mode tastes less invented than it does discovered. The best strategy is to cook it a day before you plan to serve it; it tastes better reheated than immediately, and the seasoning is most even and best distributed when it has time to spend in its rich broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/17/magazine/17eat/17mag-17eat-t_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "roasts", "keywords": "cognac, pig's foot, red wine, roast beef, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 102}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 682, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1234 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt to taste", "1 4-pound chuck eye roast, in a single tied piece if possible", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 allspice berry, freshly grated", "Olive oil for the pan", "1/2 cup onion, chopped or sliced", "1/2 cup carrot, chopped", "1/2 cup celery, chopped", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "A few garlic cloves, peeled", "1 bottle good, light-bodied red wine", "1/3 cup cognac or brandy", "1 pig's foot or beef or veal knuckle", "1 bouquet garni of a few sprigs of thyme and a small handful of parsley stems", "2 bay leaves", "1/2 to 1 cup dried porcini mushrooms", "2 to 4 cups beef stock", "Optional: a cup of parsley, finely chopped; the peel of one lemon, finely chopped; 1 clove of garlic, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "A day before cooking, salt the roast very well with kosher salt, at least twice as well as you feel comfortable doing.
