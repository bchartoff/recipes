{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb-Shoulder Mafe With Fonio", "description": "The Senegalese-born chef Pierre Thiam makes this lamb mafe with meat from the shoulder, on or off the bone, which goes tender after a stretch of unattended, gentle simmering. Adapting the dish in New York, Thiam thickened it with jarred peanut butter, which lends the sauce its characteristic creaminess, and Vietnamese fish sauce, for salty depth. Though he leaves the Scotch bonnet whole, if you want a more intense taste of it, crush it apart with a wooden spoon, and you'll tap right into its bright, floral heat. You could serve the stew with rice, or a number of other grains, but Thiam serves his on a heap of warm fonio, a tiny, tender, ancient grain that can be found partly cooked and dehydrated in many West African grocery stores, as well as specialty food stores and health food markets.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/18/magazine/18mag-eat1/18mag-18eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice", "keywords": "fish sauce, fonio, lamb shoulder, peanut butter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons peanut oil", "3 pounds lamb shoulder, trimmed and cut into 2- to 3-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 large onion, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, crushed", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "6 cups chicken stock, or water", "2 bay leaves", "2 sprigs thyme, leaves removed and chopped", "1 cup unsweetened smooth peanut butter", "6 to 8 okra, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 Scotch bonnet pepper, left whole", "2 tablespoons Vietnamese fish sauce", "1 bunch parsley, leaves finely chopped", "3 scallions, finely chopped", "1 garlic clove, crushed", "1/2 of 1 Scotch bonnet pepper, seeded and finely chopped", "Zest of 1 lemon, finely grated", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 shallots, sliced", "1 garlic clove, crushed", "1 large carrot, peeled and diced", "1/2 cup frozen green peas", "1 cup fonio"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat.
