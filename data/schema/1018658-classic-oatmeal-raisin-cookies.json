{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies", "description": "Full of nubby oats and plenty of sweet raisins, these lightly spiced cookies are pleasingly chewy in the center and crisp around the edges, with a hint of butterscotch from the dark brown sugar. They keep really well, so you can make them up to a week in advance and store them in an airtight container at room temperature. They\u2019re also great for mailing when a package of cookies is in order.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/17/dining/17COOKING-OATMEAL-RAISIN-COOKIES1/17COOKING-OATMEAL-RAISIN-COOKIES1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "3 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, oats, raisins, dessert, fall, winter, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1143}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 144, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "84 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/227 grams (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, more for pans", "1 cup/200 grams dark brown sugar, packed", "1/3 cup/66 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/187 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom or ground ginger", "3 cups/270 grams rolled oats (not instant)", "1 1/2 cups/225 grams raisins"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
