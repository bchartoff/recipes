{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crab and Artichoke Stew With Garlic Croutons", "description": "This stew is an amalgam of West Coast flavors: fresh artichokes, Dungeness crab, citrus and, yes, chardonnay. You'll start by making crab stock from the Dungeness crabs, cooking them in water, picking them clean of meat and boiling their shells to extract as much flavor as possible from these giants of the sea. Orange zest brightens the broth and artichoke hearts, diced potatoes and crab meat give the stew enough heft to warm you on a foggy afternoon. Make extra croutons. Diners will want seconds, or thirds.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project, soups and stews", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, chardonnay, dungeness crab, tuscan bread, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 241, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "409 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 cups water", "2 bay leaves", "3 Dungeness crabs", "1 teaspoon olive oil", "1 clove garlic, peeled and minced", "1 medium white onion, peeled and finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon crushed red-pepper flakes", "2 teaspoons grated orange zest", "1 cup pureed stewed tomatoes", "2 cups chardonnay", "4 medium potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice", "4 fresh artichoke hearts, cut into 1/2-inch dice", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup basil, cut across into thin strips", "2 3/4-inch-thick slices Tuscan-style bread, halved", "2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed", "2 teaspoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the stew, place the water and bay leaves in a large pot over medium-high heat.
