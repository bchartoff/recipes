{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Five-Spice Duck Breast With Blackberries", "description": "Once you know the technique, cooking a large Muscovy duck breast is no more difficult than cooking a steak. Fragrant five-spice powder \u2014 a heady mix of Sichuan pepper, fennel, clove, star anise and cinnamon \u2014 is the perfect duck seasoning, and juicy blackberries make this a brilliant summertime dish. Muscovy duck is found at better butchers, from online sources or even at some farmers' markets. Grill the duck if you prefer, but make sure to keep dripping fat from igniting and scorching the meat. The breast meat is quite lean despite its fatty skin, so it is best cooked to a rosy medium rare or it will be dry. Serve it warm, at room temperature or cold.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/12/dining/12KITCHEN1/0812Kitchen1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "blackberries, duck breast, five-spice powder, ginger, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 260}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 143, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "512 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 Muscovy duck breasts, about 1 pound each", "Salt", "2 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder", "1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated", "2 garlic cloves, smashed or diced", "1 shallot, finely diced", "2 tablespoons good sherry vinegar", "2 tablespoons brown sugar", "6 ounces blackberries", "1/2 cup rich chicken broth"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim duck breasts as necessary, removing extraneous fat or gristle.
