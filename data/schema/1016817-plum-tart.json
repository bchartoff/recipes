{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Plum Tart", "description": "This tart, adapted from the pastry chef Jacquy Pfeiffer, with whom I wrote a cookbook, is a very simple way to show off the last of the season\u2019s plums. Use the same formula for peaches, apricots and figs when those fruits are in season. The important thing to remember when making fresh fruit tarts with cut stone fruit is that you need to pack the fruit into the pastry tightly. If you don\u2019t, the fruit will collapse in the shell as it bakes, and it will lose a lot of liquid, which could make the pastry shell soggy. Another way to prevent the shell from becoming soggy is to line it with crumbs of one kind or another \u2014 they can be cookie crumbs or breadcrumbs, crumble topping or streusel, that will absorb the juice from the fruit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/24/dining/24DESSERT/24DESSERT-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 9-inch tart (8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, plum, tart shell", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 82}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "153 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 9-inch sweet pastry tart shell, fully baked <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016816-sweet-tart-dough\">(see recipe)</a>", "2 pounds/900 grams plums, pitted and cut in half if small Italian plums, cut into quarters if larger", "1 cup/120 grams crumbled vanilla cookies, bread crumbs or crumble topping", "3 tablespoons/45 grams sugar", "1/2 teaspoon/1 gram cinnamon", "1/4 to 1/2 cup apricot jam (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
