{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Soup", "description": "This sweet potato soup, given a hint of yeastiness with the addition of Belgian-style beer, could take on several roles at Thanksgiving. It may be your first course, one that\u2019s deeply flavored but not dense and heavy. Or you could ladle it into small cups for guests to sip as an hors d\u2019oeuvre before they are seated. And it provides a reason to skip the sweet potato casserole topped with marshmallows. (Though it is a tradition in many households, it\u2019s not a favorite of mine \u2014 but I did give it a shout-out by garnishing the soup with lightly toasted mini-marshmallows.) Regardless of how you serve this silken soup, be assured that it\u2019s light enough to welcome a white wine, yet rich enough to pair with red.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/dining/12PAIRING/12PAIRING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, editors' pick, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, apple, beer, heavy cream, sweet potato, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 248}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 288, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "581 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces (1/2 stick) unsalted butter", "1 large clove garlic, minced", "1 medium-size onion, diced", "1 medium-size carrot, peeled and diced", "1 rib celery, peeled and diced", "1 sprig fresh thyme, leaves only", "1 1/4 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and diced", "1 1/4 pounds tart apples, peeled and diced", "12 ounces Belgian style white beer", "1 cinnamon stick", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 cup heavy cream", "40 mini-marshmallows"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a 4-quart saucepan.
