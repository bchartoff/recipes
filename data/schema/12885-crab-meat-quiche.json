It should be light enough to serve as a first course, or in larger portions for a simple main course. It should be something to sing about. This is a rosy bisque-like shellfish quiche with a handful of crab meat (use shrimp or lobster if you like).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/29/dining/29COOKING2/29COOKING2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner", "keywords": "crab meat, eggs, heavy cream, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 126}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 341, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "466 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Short-crust dough (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12884-basic-short-crust-pastry\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>), rolled and chilled in a 9 1/2-inch tart pan", "1 small red pepper", "3 large eggs", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Black pepper to taste", "1 teaspoon paprika", "Pinch cayenne", "1 and 1/4 cups heavy cream", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon", "2 teaspoons slivered chives", "6 ounces cooked crab meat, or use chopped cooked shrimp or lobster"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake prepared dough at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned.
