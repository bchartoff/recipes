{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shredded Chicken for Tacos", "description": "Just about any food that fits on a tortilla has found its way into some type of taco, but this shredded chicken remains an easy weeknight staple. Poached in a simple broth of onion, garlic and spices, the chicken stays moist and is infused with flavor. You could opt for boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts; add some fresh cilantro or sliced jalape\u00f1o to the liquid; use a glug of light beer, if you have some on hand. Shred the cooked chicken into bite-size pieces and it\u2019s ready to be tucked into a taco with little more than some pico de gallo. You could freeze the resulting stock for future use or even boil it until thickened to drizzle it over the meat. The rules here are far from ironclad, but the fail-proof method guarantees an easy building block for tacos and beyond.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/28/dining/Shredded-Chicken/Shredded-Chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, garlic, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 458}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 265, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "315 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds boneless chicken thighs", "1 large white onion, peeled and quartered", "5 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed", "2 bay leaves", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 ancho or other mild dried chile (optional)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and add water to cover.
