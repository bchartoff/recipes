Be very careful not to overcook it; it will be al dente after just a few minutes of cooking, after which it will quickly fall apart. When cooked just right, it\u2019s silky and wonderful. You can eat it as is, or toss it with a fresh tomato sauce. Use a vegetable peeler or a mandolin to make the thin zucchini strips. It\u2019s easy to do with the peeler, which is what I use.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/08/22/health/nutrition/22recipe.health.ready/22recipe.health.ready-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 200}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 100, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "545 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds zucchini (or a combination of yellow and green zucchini)", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "3/4 cup Fresh Tomato Sauce (optional)", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, for serving (more to taste)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a vegetable peeler, cut the zucchini into lengthwise ribbons.
