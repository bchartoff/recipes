{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Asado", "description": "Asado, a complex, salty-sour dish of pork shoulder slowly cooked in tomato sauce flavored with garlic, soy sauce and calamansi (a small citrus fruit), is a dish frequently eaten in Pampanga, said to be the culinary capital of the Philippines, and it is often served at large gatherings. This recipe comes from Chad and Chase Valencia, brothers and owners of the Los Angeles restaurant Lasa, who serve their mother\u2019s asado alongside turkey and honey-roasted ham at Thanksgiving. The trick to the asado\u2019s rich depths is evaporated milk; for a little extra salt and heft, you can add grated queso de bola, the nutty Filipino cheese served during the holidays. Don\u2019t skip the overnight refrigeration step, which really allows the flavors to deepen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/21valenciarex3/merlin_146708919_812155fe-02d9-4e24-b88c-6bcf94ccf8c6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT11H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "boneless pork shoulder, calamansi, evaporated milk, queso de bola, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 49}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 831, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "57 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "2307 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds boneless pork shoulder", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons canola, grapeseed or other neutral oil", "1 medium yellow onion, chopped", "1/4 cup sliced garlic cloves, cut 1/8-inch thick (from about 8 to 10 cloves)", "1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce", "3/4 cup calamansi or lemon juice", "3/4 cup soy sauce", "1 bay leaf", "1/4 to 1/2 cup grated queso de bola (or Edam cheese), optional", "1/2 cup evaporated milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Divide the pork shoulder into 4 pieces.
