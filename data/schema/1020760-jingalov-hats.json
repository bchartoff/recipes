{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jingalov Hats", "description": "This recipe for jingalov hats, the simple flatbread stuffed with a mix of greens, comes from \u201cLavash,\u201d an Armenian cookbook by John Lee, Ara Zada and Kate Leahy. The authors got the recipe in Artsakh from Lilia Harutyunyan, a local baker who mixes tangy wild sorrel and dandelion greens with soft herbs such as chervil and cilantro, as well as earthy beet greens, chard and spinach. The key to a great bread is in the mix of greens, which gently steam inside the bread as it cooks on the stovetop. Wash and dry all the greens in a salad spinner to remove as much moisture as possible before chopping. The pomegranate seeds are optional, though Ms. Harutyunyan likes to add them for extra tang.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/05/magazine/05mag-eat/05mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 (8-inch) hats", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, pastries, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, chard, cilantro, flour, lemon, pomegranate seeds, radish, scallion, sorrel, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 334}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2/3 cup lukewarm water", "Sunflower oil or other neutral oil, for greasing", "2 pounds chard, tough stems discarded", "4 packed cups fresh cilantro, chervil and dill leaves and tender stems", "4 packed cups radish greens and sorrel", "6 spring onions (or 10 scallions), thinly sliced", "3 tablespoons sunflower oil or other neutral oil", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 handfuls pomegranate seeds (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a medium bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour and the salt.
