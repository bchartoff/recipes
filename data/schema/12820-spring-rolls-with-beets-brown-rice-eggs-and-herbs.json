Swirl the pan so that the egg covers the bottom in an even layer, and lift the edges of the thin omelet with your spatula to let the egg run underneath. Push the pan away from you and quickly jerk it toward you to flip or fold the omelet over (if it just folds, that\u2019s fine). Turn out of the pan onto a plate. Repeat with the other two eggs and remaining oil.

Place a large spoonful or handful of beets (wear plastic gloves if you don\u2019t want the beets to color your hands) down the middle of the wrapper but slightly closer to the bottom, leaving a 2-inch margin on the sides. Place a handful of cabbage over the beets, then a handful of rice. Arrange 3 slices of omelet over the rice. Fold the sides in, then roll up the spring rolls tightly, squeezing the filling to get a tight roll. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve with a dipping sauce of your choice if desired"}]}
