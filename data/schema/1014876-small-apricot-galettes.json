{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Small Apricot Galettes", "description": "I use my yeasted dessert galette pastry for these individual free-form tarts. The tarts are simple and rustic, meant to show off apricots in season. For the pastry: The easiest way to work with this pastry dough is to freeze the thin disks right after rolling out. They\u2019ll thaw in no time. You need only half of the dough for the individual galettes, unless you want to double the filling quantities and make 16. They freeze well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/06/science/12recipehealth/12recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 individual galettes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apricot, dessert, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 14}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 305, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "159 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 grams (1 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast", "115 grams (1/2 cup) lukewarm water", "2 tablespoons plus 1/4 teaspoon sugar", "1 large egg, at room temperature, beaten", "135 grams (1 cup) whole-wheat flour", "155 grams (1 1/4 cups) unbleached flour", "25 grams (1/4 cup) almond powder (also known as almond flour; optional; substitute whole-wheat flour if not using)", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "60 grams (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter at room temperature", "1 1/2 pounds apricots, pitted and halved or quartered, depending on the size", "3 tablespoons lightly toasted slivered almonds", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "3 tablespoons turbinado or brown sugar", "25 grams (1/4 cup) almond powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dissolve the yeast in the water, add 1/4 teaspoon of the sugar, and allow to sit until the mixture is creamy, about 5 minutes.
