{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crepes-Style Manicotti", "description": "For many Italian-American families, in New Jersey and elsewhere, the Thanksgiving smorgasbord doesn\u2019t feel quite right without a little touch of red sauce. So you say: \u201cManicotti? That doesn\u2019t really go with turkey and stuffing and cranberries.\u201d What, you want to argue about it? Besides, Thanksgiving also represents an American expression of abbondanza, the Italian concept of too-muchness that makes a meal feel epic. \n\nHere, courtesy of Reservoir Tavern, which has been serving customers in the Boonton area since 1936, comes a recipe for baked manicotti that uses crepes in place of pasta. Nicola Bevacqua, a member of the family that owns the place, said that his own family digs into this melted-cheese masterwork each holiday, as do the New Jersey locals who drop by to pick it up. The crepes, he assured us, \u201care light and airy and will leave you plenty of room for the turkey.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19NEWJERSEY/19NEWJERSEY-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "crepes, marinara sauce, ricotta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 160}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 474, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "874 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large white onion, finely chopped", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "2 (28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes", "1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed", "1/8 teaspoon sugar", "4 fresh basil leaves, minced", "8 large eggs", "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1  1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 pounds ricotta", "2 cups shredded mozzarella (from about 10 ounces)", "1 cup grated Parmesan (from about 2 ounces)", "1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley", "1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1 cup grated pecorino Romano (from about 2 ounces), plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the marinara sauce:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
