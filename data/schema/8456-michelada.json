{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Michelada", "description": "And just what is in a michelada? In Mexico City, it consists of fresh lime juice, a trinity of Tabasco, Worcestershire and soy sauces, a pinch of black pepper and maybe (or maybe not) a dash of Maggi, the seasoning usually used for soups and stews. This mix makes up two or three fingers' worth of a tall glass. That glass needs ice in it. It needs beer. And it needs drinking. At least, I certainly think it does. It might sound like a hangover recipe, but to me it tastes like malted manna.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tim Weiner"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/13/dining/13COOKING-MICHELADA1/13COOKING-MICHELADA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 cocktail", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "fall, key lime, negra modelo, worcestershire sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 67}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 158, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "877 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 lime, preferably a Key lime", "Coarse salt", "2 dashes Worcestershire sauce", "1 dash soy sauce", "1 dash Tabasco sauce", "1 pinch black pepper", "1 dash Maggi seasoning, optional", "12 ounces beer, preferably a dark Mexican beer like Negra Modelo"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Squeeze the juice from the lime and reserve.
