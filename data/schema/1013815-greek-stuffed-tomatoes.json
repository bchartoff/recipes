With a sharp paring knife, cut out the tops of the tomatoes as you would a jack-o\u2019-lantern, leaving them intact so that you can replace them when you bake the tomatoes.

Place a strainer over a bowl, and rub the seed pods against the strainer. Discard the seeds. Finely chop the pulp. Add to the bowl with the juice.
