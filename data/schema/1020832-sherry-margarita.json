It\u2019s also distinctly more saline than other fino sherries (which you could also use in this recipe). Combined with a pinch of salt, manzanilla amplifies and brightens the lime, rounds tequila\u2019s edge and allows this margarita to go down that much more smoothly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/12/dining/12Salt-Margarita/merlin_168265362_4153d810-7ffb-4680-aaca-a7d871e2dbfe-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "lime, orange liqueur, sea salt, sherry, tequila", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 10}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce manzanilla sherry", "1 ounce blanco tequila", "3/4 ounce orange liqueur", "3/4 ounce fresh lime juice", "1/4 ounce agave or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014441-simple-syrup\">simple syrup</a>", "Pinch of flaky sea salt", "Ice", "Lime wedge or wheel, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a shaker, combine the sherry, tequila, orange liqueur, lime juice, agave and salt.
