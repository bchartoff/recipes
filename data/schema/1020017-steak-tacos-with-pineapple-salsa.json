It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</em>\nGet some fresh tortillas and a pound of skirt steak, then make salsa from mostly fresh or canned pineapple, pickled jalape\u00f1os and a healthy couple shakes of chile powder, along with plenty of chopped cilantro. Shower the steaks with salt and pepper, and broil them for 2 to 3 minutes a side until they\u2019re perfect and rare. Warm the tortillas. Grate some Cheddar. Rest the steak, slice it, and serve with the tortillas, cheese and that awesome salsa. Anyone want to watch a movie after dinner?
