{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blue Cheese Swirl Bread", "description": "This easy skillet bread gets lightly crusty on the outside, but stays soft and fluffy inside. The dough is shaped into a log, then blue cheese is pressed into the dough before it\u2019s rolled into a spiral. The finished loaf smells amazing, and looks like it took way more effort than it did. Serve alongside soups or stews, or all on its own as a tasty snack.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/13/dining/em-blue-cheese-bread/em-blue-cheese-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, blue cheese, butter, heavy cream, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 117}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 326, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "272 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/235 milliliters whole milk", "4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), plus more for greasing", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters cool water", "4 cups/510 grams all-purpose flour", "2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "7 ounces/200 grams creamy or firm blue cheese, crumbled", "Heavy cream, for brushing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and butter over medium until the butter is melted.
