{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Port and Tonic", "description": "White port with tonic is a common drink throughout Portugal. The light-bodied and fruity wine pairs well with the bitterness of tonic, creating a happy, easygoing drink. A 1-to-2 ratio works best here; you don\u2019t want to use too much tonic or the gentle flavors of the port will be overwhelmed. Choice of tonic is a matter of preference. Canada Dry makes for a livelier mix, but the lighter Q Tonic leads to a more elegant drink. La Taberna in Napa, Calif., tops the drink with a lime wedge, but I find a lemon a more harmonious companion.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20PORT/20PORT-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "portuguese", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "summer, tonic water, white port", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 30}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 99, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "14 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces white port", "3 ounces tonic water", "Wedge of lime or lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a tumbler with ice.
