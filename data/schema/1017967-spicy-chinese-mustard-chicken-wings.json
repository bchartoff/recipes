{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Chinese Mustard Chicken Wings", "description": "In Chinese-American restaurants, spicy yellow mustard often appears on the table as a dipping sauce \u2014 but you rarely taste it anywhere else in the meal. Jonathan Wu, the chef at the innovative Chinese-influenced restaurant Fung Tu in New York, decided to take that flavor and run with it. The two kinds of mustard (along with cayenne) makes these almost as spicy as Buffalo wings, but the heat is balanced by sweetness. To make a prettier plate, sprinkle with whole cilantro leaves and minced scallions.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/02/dining/02CHINESEREX/02CHINESEREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, cayenne pepper, chicken wings, dijon mustard, ginger, lager, mustard powder, peanut oil, potato starch", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 73}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 746, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "46 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "996 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds wings, separated into wingettes and drumettes (see note)", "1/4 cup kosher salt", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1 1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, thinly sliced but not peeled", "4 scallions, white and light green parts", "2 cloves garlic", "Potato starch or all-purpose flour, for frying", "Peanut, canola or another neutral oil, for frying", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 tablespoon minced scallions", "1 cup yellow Dijon mustard (not whole grain)", "1/2 cup lager beer", "1/2 cup brown sugar, more to taste", "1/3 cup ketchup", "1/4 cup sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce", "1 teaspoon dry mustard, more to taste", "1 teaspoon cayenne, more to taste", "2 teaspoons black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Up to 1 day before cooking, bring about 1 1/2 quarts water to a boil in a saucepan.
