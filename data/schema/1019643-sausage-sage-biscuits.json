{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sausage Sage Biscuits", "description": "For an easy, savory breakfast treat, browned sausage and sage are folded into biscuit dough that\u2019s cut into squares. A generous grinding of black pepper in the mix and on top adds a bit of kick. The flaky biscuits are delicious on their own or stuffed with eggs: Scrambled, fried or poached are all great, but so is egg salad. If you\u2019d like, you can garnish the biscuits with whole sage leaves. Simply brush the unbaked squares with a little melted butter, gently press on a sage leaf, and brush the leaf with a little more butter before baking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/dining/gk-sage-biscuits/gk-sage-biscuits-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "20 biscuits", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick breads", "keywords": "black pepper, buttermilk, sage, sausage, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 91}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 173, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "242 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces fresh pork breakfast sausage, bulk or in links", "1/2 teaspoon neutral oil", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dough", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for sprinkling", "1/2 cup/115 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into thin slices", "1/4 cup chopped sage leaves", "1 1/4 cups buttermilk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the sausage in a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet.
