{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beans and Garlic Toast in Broth", "description": "A simple dish of creamy, thin-skinned beans and broth on toast is easy to make, and a comfort to eat alone or feed a crowd. If you make the beans ahead of time, they can keep in the fridge for 3 days, but may need a splash of water added when you heat them up. The broth is a great way to make use of parmigiano rinds, if you happen to be saving those, but if you don\u2019t have any lying around, you can still make it rich with umami: Whisk a heaped tablespoon of white miso with a little of the bean broth to make it smooth and lump-free, then add it back to the pot. It will add a similar, savory depth. The dish seems plain, but it won\u2019t be if you season the broth well, and garnish each bowl generously with olive oil, grated cheese and herbs, just before you eat it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/25/magazine/25mag-eat1-copy/25mag-eat1-copy-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, beans", "keywords": "dried beans, garlic, parmesan, sourdough, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 489}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 602, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1230 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried beans, such as cannellini or cranberry", "1 small onion, peeled\u00a0", "2 garlic cloves, peeled\u00a0", "Up to 4 ounces Parmesan rinds", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 thick slices crusty sourdough bread", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 garlic clove, peeled", "2 tablespoons parsley leaves, chopped", "1 tablespoon marjoram leaves, chopped", "Flaky sea salt, finely grated Parmesan and freshly ground black pepper, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If you remember, soak the beans in cold water overnight, or for 10 to 12 hours.

This could take 1 to 2 hours or more, depending on the beans and whether or not you soaked them.
