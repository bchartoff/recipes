This short rib recipe, brought to The Times in 2011, was among the dishes he served, both to his family (on the first night) and his diners (on the second and third nights). It\u2019s a Sephardic take on his grandmother\u2019s tsimmes and brisket, prepared a day in advance and refrigerated to let the flavors meld and the fat float to the top to be skimmed. Serve it as part of a Seder, or for just about any special occasion. It is sure to impress.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/pruneribs-still/pruneribs-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beef short ribs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 155}, "recipeIngredient": ["7 pounds beef short ribs or 5 pounds flanken, cut in 4-inch portions", "Salt", "Black pepper", "1/4 cup rendered duck fat or chicken fat, or canola oil", "1 large Spanish onion, diced", "3 large carrots, peeled and diced", "2 celery stalks, diced", "3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and smashed", "2 cups ruby port", "2 cups red wine", "4 cups pitted prunes", "1 1/4 cup slivered almonds, lightly toasted", "4 ounces shiitake, crimini or other mushrooms, diced", "1/2 cup loosely packed chopped parsley", "4 fresh thyme sprigs", "1 bay leaf", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 clove", "1 star anise", "Zest of 1 orange, in strips", "4 cups veal, beef or chicken stock, or as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
