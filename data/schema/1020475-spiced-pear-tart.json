{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Pear Tart", "description": "Gently spiced poached pears, vanilla pastry cream and flaky puff pastry are the stars of this sophisticated dessert that was created for the 2019 NYT Food Festival by Rachel Gaylord, the pastry chef at La Mercerie in New York. Ideally, this delicate tart should be eaten the day it\u2019s made, so if you\u2019re planning to serve this at a dinner party, make all of the components in advance and assemble the tart just before your guests arrive. Leftovers, if you have any, should be stored in the refrigerator and brought to room temperature before serving. The pastry will have lost some of its flakiness, but it will still be delicious. (This adaptation mercifully calls for store-bought puff pastry, but if you\u2019re feeling ambitious, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2483-puff-pastry\">you can make your own</a>.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/ml-pear-tart/ml-pear-tart-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "almond, pears, puff pastry, star anise, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 9}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "4 to 6 star anise pods", "2 semi-ripe Bartlett pears, peeled, cut in half lengthwise and seeded", "1 sheet store-bought puff pastry (about 8.5 ounces)", "1 egg, beaten", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 cup/60 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons/25 grams cornstarch", "4 egg yolks, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons/25 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1/2 cup pear pur\u00e9e or applesauce", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/50 grams toasted sliced almonds, for garnish (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Poach the pears: Combine 2 cups/480 milliliters water, sugar, vanilla extract and star anise pods in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
