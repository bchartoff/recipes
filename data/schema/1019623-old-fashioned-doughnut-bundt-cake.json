{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Old-Fashioned Doughnut Bundt Cake", "description": "This simple vanilla Bundt cake has plenty of freshly grated nutmeg to nod to the flavor of old-fashioned doughnuts. But since it\u2019s baked rather than fried, it also gets a generous coating of melted butter while it\u2019s still warm to give it some of that doughnut richness. Then it\u2019s coated in cinnamon-sugar. It\u2019s neither a doughnut nor a cake \u2013 it\u2019s both. It\u2019s delicious right after it\u2019s made, but it tastes even more like an old-fashioned doughnut after sitting overnight. Store it tightly wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature for up to 4 days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/27/dining/ed-doughnut-bundt-cake-horizontal/ed-doughnut-bundt-cake-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "butter, buttermilk, cinnamon, flour, nutmeg, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1005}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 460, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "310 milligrams", "sugarContent": "37 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 1/2 cup/115 grams, melted, for finishing", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams plus 2/3 cup/135 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3 1/2 cups/445 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
