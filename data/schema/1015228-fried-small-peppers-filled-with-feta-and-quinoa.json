{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Small Peppers Filled With Feta and Quinoa", "description": "The starting off point for this recipe is a classic Balkan cheese-stuffed pepper dish that I enjoyed frequently over the course of a long ago summer spent in Croatia. The peppers that are traditionally used for this are small, thin-skinned green peppers that taper to a single tip. These aren\u2019t easy to find locally, but I have recently found \u201cbaby bell peppers\u201d that are the perfect size for this. I also make these stuffed peppers with Anaheims, which are spicy. The authentic filling is made with feta, herbs and egg only, but I decided to introduce some quinoa or bulgur to stretch the filling and make the peppers more substantial.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/15/science/15recipehealth/15recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings as an hors d\u2019oeuvre or 4 as a side dish", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, feta, quinoa, sweet pepper, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 126, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "135 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 small sweet peppers, either baby bell or Italian peppers, about 1 pound", "1 egg yolk", "3 ounces feta, crumbled (about 3/4 cup)", "1/2 cup cooked quinoa or bulgur", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley or mint", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour", "2 to 3 tablespoons sunflower or grapeseed oil, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Roast the peppers over a flame or under the broiler until charred.
