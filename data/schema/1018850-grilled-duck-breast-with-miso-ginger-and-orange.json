Substitute duck legs if you wish (they\u2019ll take a bit longer to cook), or use large chicken breasts if duck isn\u2019t available. Here the duck breast is thinly sliced for a summery main-course salad, but keep the flavorful technique in mind for use throughout the year.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/26/dining/26KITCHEN1/26KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, salads and dressings", "keywords": "duck breast, green beans, lettuce, mango, mirin, miso, sake, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 66}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 210, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "668 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large duck breasts (about 2 pounds)", "Salt and pepper", "4 tablespoons red miso", "2 tablespoons light soy sauce or tamari", "1 tablespoon sake or mirin", "1 tablespoon grated orange zest", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "1 garlic clove, minced", "Pinch of cayenne", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "4 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice", "6 ounces small green beans, topped and tailed", "Lettuce leaves, for serving", "1 large mango, peeled and sliced", "Watercress sprigs, for garnish (optional)", "3 tablespoons chopped scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim duck breasts of extraneous fat (or ask your butcher to trim them) and score the skin.
