{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken Fajitas", "description": "You might think fajitas are too fussy for a weeknight, but this easy, foolproof version roasts on a sheet pan and can be ready in an hour. Because the ingredients are thinly sliced, everything cooks in a flash \u2014 and with little attention required. Smoked paprika, chipotle chiles and a quick stop under the broiler provide the smoky flavor that would traditionally come from the grill. This recipe is very adaptable: Chicken is called for here, but you could also use shrimp or skirt steak. For a vegetarian version, substitute fresh corn kernels, mushrooms, poblano peppers or zucchini for the meat. Cut the vegetables into sizes you\u2019d want in a taco, coat them in the lime-chipotle marinade, roast until cooked, then broil until charred.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/dining/as-sheet-pan-chicken-fajitas-2/merlin_150866643_6eb4a6b5-a422-4a8a-bc8b-3922cb2a025b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, lunch, weekday", "keywords": "chicken, chipotles in adobo, cumin, smoked paprika, tortilla, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 475}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 737, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1133 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons olive oil", "1 lime, zested and juiced (about 2 teaspoons zest and 2 tablespoons juice)", "1 to 2 chipotle chiles in adobo, to taste, coarsely chopped", "2 teaspoons ground cumin or crushed cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices", "3 bell peppers, any color or a combination", "1 large red onion", "8 flour tortillas, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
