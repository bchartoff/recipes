Select a length of casing and run water from the tap through it in order to clear out any excess salt and spot any holes, which you should trim out. Cut a length of casing at least 3 to 4 feet long; tie it off. Run the casing between your fingers to remove excess water. Stretch the open end of the casing around the attachment\u2019s nozzle and gradually slide the rest of the casing onto the nozzle, an inch or 2 at a time. Leave about 3 inches at the knotted end dangling free. Put the sausage in the hopper of the grinder and turn it on (Speed 4 tends to work best). Hold the dangling casing with one hand, and with the other, feed the sausage mixture into the hopper with a wooden pestle at an even pace. When 2 inches of casing are empty at both the knotted and free ends, stop stuffing and slowly pull on the casing to free it from the stuffer nozzle. Run your fingers over the casing to distribute the sausage evenly. Pinch the middle of the sausage and gently twist it to form two long links. Keep pinching and twisting to form links 4 or 5 inches long. Repeat this process until all of the sausage meat has been used, pushing out the last bits of meat with another slice or two of bread."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whether you\u2019ve made patties or links, refrigerating the sausage overnight, wrapped in wax paper, will help it hold together as it cooks. To cook, snip off a single length containing as many individual sausages as you like. Don\u2019t separate the links until they have been cooked (in an oiled skillet, on the grill or under the broiler). Any uncooked remainders will freeze well."}]}
