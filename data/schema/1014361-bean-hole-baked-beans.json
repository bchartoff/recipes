You need to dig a hole in your yard and build a fire in that hole to cook the beans. An important note: Failing to dig the hole, and using your oven instead, will result in beans that lack bona fides but are 98 percent as good as the ones that guy cooked in a hole in his yard.  This recipe will take about 3 hours plus soaking time for the oven method.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/05beanhole/05beanhole-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "dried beans, molasses, salt pork, fall, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 458, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1029 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds dried beans of your choice (soldier, pea, Jacob\u2019s Cattle, great northern, yellow eye, etc.)", "3 onions, thinly sliced", "3/4 cup molasses", "1/2 cup maple syrup", "2 tablespoons dry mustard", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 tablespoon black pepper", "1 pound salt pork, sliced into pieces about 2 inches by 1/2 inch"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak beans overnight in water to cover or quick-soak: Put beans in a large pot, add water to cover by 2 inches and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.
