{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shortcut Guanciale", "description": "There is an edge of obsessiveness to carbonara \u2014 and I gave in to it completely by starting to make my own guanciale, the cured pig cheek central to most Italian versions of the dish. There\u2019s no real need to; it\u2019s available online, but I was inspired after eating a wonderful meal at Vetri Ristorante in Philadelphia, and buying a cookbook, \u201cRustic Italian Food,\u201d by its owner, Marc Vetri. He made it sound easy \u2014 and it is. It\u2019s also satisfying. Guanciale is generally cured for a week, then hung to dry for about three weeks, which is how I usually make it. A fireplace is perfect. But Mr. Vetri has a version that cures for only three days, then is baked. If you order raw cheeks, they need to be trimmed. You want to end up with a neat, flat slab, roughly an inch and a half thick. The key is to cut off the glands, down to the first level of meat, and all excess fat. Here is Mr. Vetri\u2019s recipe:", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ian Fisher"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/shortcut-guanciale/shortcut-guanciale-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 68}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 187, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "273 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pork jowl (about 1 pound)", "2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons dextrose powder or 1 1/2 teaspoons superfine sugar (I use the latter)", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground pepper", "1 teaspoon curing salt No. 1 (available at Amazon.com) ", "1 teaspoon crushed garlic", "1 tablespoon chopped rosemary "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse pork jowl and pat dry.
