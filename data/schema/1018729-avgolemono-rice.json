The rice is cooked \u201cpasta style,\u201d in plenty of boiling salted water and drained when done, which is how we cook rice pretty much all the time now, dodging the sometimes mushy, sometimes waterlogged, sometimes al dente results of the usual cooking method. The egg-lemon sauce is tart and creamy at the same time, a unique richness without any cream or butter, that is killer almost anywhere it lands, from warm asparagus, to gently roasted salmon, to cold poached chicken, to steamed artichokes, even to orzo pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/16/magazine/16eat2/16eat2-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "lamb stock, peas, rice, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 192}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 322, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "582 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Coarse kosher salt, for cooking rice and for seasoning the sauce", "1 1/4 cups jasmine rice", "3/4 cup frozen small peas", "2 cups excellent homemade brown lamb stock (using well-roasted bones; even better if bits of meat remain)", "5 large egg yolks", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice", "4 scallions, sliced in 1/3-inch rings, on a slight bias", "Freshly and finely ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 8 cups of water to a rolling boil.
