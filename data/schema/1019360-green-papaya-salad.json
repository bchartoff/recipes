{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Papaya Salad", "description": "This tangy, piquant salad is a version of the classic Vietnamese dish, which can be served as a first course, or a fiery side dish next to simple grilled meats or fish. It comes from Chris Shepherd, a Houston chef who is trying to tell the story of his city's food, among the most diverse in the country. If Thai chiles are too hot to bear (or not available), substitute other, milder peppers like serrano or jalape\u00f1o. Just don't use regular papaya even if it seems unripe; it won't have the right flavor and texture as a true green papaya. And if you can\u2019t get green papaya, you can make this with green mango, seeded cucumber, cabbage or kohlrabi. The intense, funky dressing will work with any practically any cooling, crunchy vegetable you\u2019ve got.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/08/dining/08papaya/08papaya-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dried shrimp, fish sauce, green papaya, thai chili", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 50}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 168, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1447 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon chopped dried shrimp", "1/4 cup fish sauce", "1/4 cup sugar", "4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 lime, quartered", "1 to 2 Thai chiles, preferably red, stemmed and thinly sliced (or more, if you\u2019d like more heat)", "4 cups peeled, shredded green papaya (from 1 medium green papaya)", "10 cherry tomatoes, halved", "2 tablespoons roasted unsalted peanuts, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large metal or wooden bowl (not glass), stir together dried shrimp, fish sauce, sugar, garlic, lime and chiles.
