It\u2019s the state that produces the most pumpkin for canning. This vibrant soup, from the chef Rick Bayless, an owner of Frontera Grill and Topolobampo in Chicago, is inspired by Mexico, where pumpkin is as typical an ingredient as the pepitas, ancho chile, canela and crema that are also in the recipe. His original calls for fresh squash or pumpkin \u2014 about 1 1/2 pounds, peeled, seeded, cut in chunks and added to the pot with the apple. But Mr. Bayless was amenable to adapting his recipe for canned pur\u00e9e, paying homage to Illinois.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19ILLINOIS/19ILLINOIS-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "pumpkin, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 417}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 150, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "350 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup pepitas (shelled pumpkin seeds)", "1 medium onion, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1 dried ancho chile, stemmed, seeded and torn in small strips", "1 apple, peeled, cored and chopped", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, preferably Mexican canela", "3 cups plain canned pumpkin (about 1 1/2 cans)", "Salt to taste", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 cup Mexican crema, or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, mascarpone or sour cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan.
