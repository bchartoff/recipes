Flipping the patties frequently as they cook ensures an evenly cooked interior and good flavor development on the exterior. To make the burgers vegetarian, feel free to use any good melting cheese, such as American, Cheddar or Swiss, but to make them strictly vegan, be sure to look for vegan burger buns, as standard supermarket burger buns frequently contain milk or other dairy products.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
