The herb-flecked green goddess dressing is creamy and rich, with a tartly pungent edge from garlic and lemon juice. Like all pasta salads, this benefits from being made a few hours ahead, so the pasta can absorb most flavor from the dressing. But don\u2019t add the vegetables until just before serving so they maintain their crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/12/dining/07apperex2/merlin_155266893_3780fb73-591f-412a-bb00-0ae73341aea3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastas, salads and dressings", "keywords": "arugula, fennel, peas, tortellini, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 267}, "recipeIngredient": ["Fine sea salt, as needed", "2 (9- to 10-ounce) packages cheese tortellini", "1 fennel bulb with fronds, tough outer layers removed (see Note)", "1 cup sour cream or plain full-fat Greek yogurt", "1 packed cup basil leaves", "2 tablespoons coarsely chopped chives", "2 packed tablespoons parsley leaves", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "3 scallions, white and green parts", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "2/3 cup sliced sugar-snap peas", "1 cup baby arugula"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a pot of heavily salted water, cook the tortellini according to the package directions."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: While the water comes to a boil, chop enough of the fennel fronds to equal 1/4 cup.
