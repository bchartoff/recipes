Picking the herbs and cleaning them is a finicky task, but can be done a day or two before.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/26/dining/26COOKING_HERBSALAD1/26COOKING_HERBSALAD1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings (can be doubled)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, arugula, basil, cilantro, dill, lettuce, m\u00e2che, parsley, purslane, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 184}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 160, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "157 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups cilantro leaves", "1 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1 cup small dill sprigs", "1 cup basil or mint leaves", "1 cup arugula leaves", "2 cups purslane, m\u00e2che or hearts of Boston lettuce leaves", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup sliced almonds", "Salt and coarsely ground black pepper", "\u00bc teaspoon red chile flakes or 1/2 teaspoon crushed pink peppercorns (optional)", "3 tablespoons lemon juice, more to taste", "2 tablespoons olive oil, more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Up to a day before serving, wash the herbs and greens: Fill a large bowl or clean sink with plenty of cold water.
