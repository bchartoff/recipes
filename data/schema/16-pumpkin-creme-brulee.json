Pour the mixture into six four-ounce molds. Set the molds in the oven in a baking pan containing enough hot water to come one inch up the sides of the molds. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until set. To determine if the custard is done, lightly tap the sides of the custard dish; if the mixture &quot;makes waves&quot; then it is not done. Cool slightly on a wire rack, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours or overnight."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the broiler just before serving. Evenly sprinkle one teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of each custard. Broil until the sugar caramelizes, anywhere from one to four minutes, depending on broiler's heat. Watch carefully so the sugar doesn't burn; it should be a golden brown. Serve in individual molds on dessert plates."}]}
