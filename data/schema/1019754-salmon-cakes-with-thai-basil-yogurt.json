{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon Cakes With Thai Basil Yogurt", "description": "Ginger and Thai basil yogurt is a wonderful accompaniment for these fish cakes, but they are also great with just a squeeze of lime if you want to save time. The cakes are best cooked as soon as they are shaped and served as a starter or a snack. However, if you wish to make them ahead of time, or if it's just a matter of preference, swap out the sunchokes (also known as Jerusalem artichokes) for more potato and chill them once they are formed. They should keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator, ready to be fried. If you cook them from cold, pop them into a hot oven after frying to make sure they are properly heated through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/21ottorex2/21ottorex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 main course or 8 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, greek yogurt, salmon fillet, sunchoke, thai basil, wakame seaweed", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 37}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1081, "unsaturatedFatContent": "40 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "67 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "80 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "1466 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/500 grams sunchokes (also known as Jerusalem artichokes)", "5 tablespoons/60 milliliters olive oil", "Flaky or fine sea salt", "1/2 pound/250 grams white or yellow potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/4-inch/3-centimeter chunks", "2 tablespoons finely chopped Thai basil, plus 12 whole leaves (or use a combination of normal basil and cilantro)", "1/4 cup/10 grams wakame seaweed, roughly broken up into 1-inch/2-centimeter pieces if large", "1 teaspoon peeled minced ginger", "Scant 1/3 cup/25 grams finely chopped green onions (from 2 or 3 green onions, green parts only)", "1/2 garlic clove (or 1 small clove), crushed", "2 limes (finely grate the zest to get 2 teaspoons then cut into wedges for serving)", "2 1/2 tablespoons potato starch (potato flour), or use all-purpose flour", "1 egg, beaten", "3/4 pound/350 grams store-bought cooked salmon (3 or 4 fillets), skin removed and roughly broken into 1 1/2-inch/4-centimeter pieces (see note)", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "8 Thai basil leaves, finely chopped (or use a combination of normal basil and cilantro)", "1 1/2 teaspoons peeled minced ginger", "1 lime (finely grate the zest to get 1 1/2 teaspoons and juice to get 1 1/2 tablespoons)", "1/4 garlic clove, crushed", "1 scant cup/200 grams plain Greek yogurt", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit/230 degrees Celsius and position a rack in the top third of the oven."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large bowl with water.
