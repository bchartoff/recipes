You might be tempted to skip salting your tomatoes, but don\u2019t: It helps prevent a soggy crust while intensifying the flavor of your tomatoes.\u00a0This tart is best enjoyed straight out of the oven, at its flaky prime, but it\u2019s also great at room temperature, or even cold, devoured directly from the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/29/dining/aw-roasted-tomato-tart-with-ricotta-and-pesto/aw-roasted-tomato-tart-with-ricotta-and-pesto-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, pastries, pies and tarts, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, basil, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, pesto, puff pastry, red onion, tomato, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 461}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 small, multicolored tomatoes, such as heirloom, kumato or Campari (about 12 ounces total), sliced crosswise 1/4-inch thick", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 sheet\u00a0packaged puff pastry, thawed\u00a0(about 7 ounces)\u00a0", "3 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream", "1/4 small red onion, very thinly sliced", "Aleppo pepper or red-pepper flakes, for garnish (optional)", "3/4 cup fresh ricotta", "Store-bought or\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2653-basic-pesto\">homemade pesto</a>, for drizzling", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a large baking sheet with paper towels.
