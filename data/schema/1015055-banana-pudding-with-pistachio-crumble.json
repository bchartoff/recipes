{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banana Pudding With Pistachio Crumble", "description": "This banana pudding is not the usual vanilla-wafer-topped affair, and it doesn\u2019t come from the South. It came to The Times in 2013 from Fedora, a restaurant in Manhattan, and it is divine: a rich, creamy custard fragrant with pur\u00e9ed ripe banana, topped  with lightly salted, crisp crumbles of pistachio butter cookie. It is also irresistible \u2014 sweet, creamy, salty, crunchy \u2014 and all too easy to lap up. The pudding and crumble can be made entirely in advance (up to three days), though don\u2019t sprinkle the crumbs over the top until you're ready to serve. You want to maintain the crunch for as long as possible, and once the cookie meets the pudding, the countdown begins.
