This is a vegetable that expresses itself well in a wide range of dishes; just about every cuisine in the world knows how to show it off. It's an excellent low-calorie food, with only 19 calories per cup of raw squash. This dish is great on its own as a side dish, but it can also be incorporated into many other recipes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/08/18/health/nutrition/18recipe.health.ready/18recipe.health.ready-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 183}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 51, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "248 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 medium onion, chopped (about 1 cup chopped)", "2 plump garlic cloves, minced", "1 1/2 pounds summer squash, cut in 1/2-inch dice", "1 small red pepper, cut in 1/4-inch dice", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat and add the onion.
