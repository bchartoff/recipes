{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cider-Glazed Brussels Sprouts", "description": "Simple roasted brussels sprouts get an autumnal upgrade when they are tossed with a tangy, sweet glaze made from apple cider, apple cider vinegar and mustard. If you\u2019re making these for Thanksgiving, make the glaze (see Tip) and trim the brussels sprouts in advance, then pop the sprouts into the oven while the turkey rests. Note that this recipe is easily doubled for larger groups: Just use a larger skillet for the sauce and two sheet pans for the sprouts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/dining/lh-cider-braised-brussels-sprouts/merlin_163577493_598520fc-9039-4b43-95a9-3f6036fd1bef-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, vegetables", "keywords": "apple cider, apple cider vinegar, brussels sprouts, shallot, fall, winter, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 215}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved, quartered if very large", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup finely chopped shallots (about 2 medium shallots)", "2 cups apple cider", "3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
