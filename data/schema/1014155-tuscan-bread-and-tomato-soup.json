{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tuscan Bread and Tomato Soup", "description": "Although some bread soups are very simple mixtures of bread and broth, the ones I love most are packed with produce. And while the traditional versions of the Mediterranean soups are made with white bread, there\u2019s no reason not to use whole-grain breads in these recipes. I don\u2019t recommend sourdough, however, because the flavor is too strong.  Called pappa al pomodoro, this humble mixture of bread, tomatoes, garlic and basil has a luxurious flavor. Although the soup is traditionally made with unsalted Tuscan bread, it works beautifully with any country bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/19/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, country bread, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 224, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "687 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 small onion, chopped", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 (28-ounce) can chopped tomatoes, with juice", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "Pinch of sugar", "Pinch of red chili flakes", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "4 cups water", "1 pound stale country bread, crusts removed, cut into cubes about 7 cups", "2 to 3 tablespoons slivered fresh basil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large, heavy soup pot over medium-low heat.
