{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Puffy Corn Pancake With Blackberry Sauce", "description": "This pancake is similar to a recipe that ran in The Times in 1966 called <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9408-david-eyres-pancake\">David Eyre\u2019s pancake</a>, named for a man whose fame seems to rest mainly on this tasty invention.\n\nHere, in addition to the corn kernels I wanted to use up, I stirred in some cornmeal to highlight the corn factor. Because cornmeal can make things heavy and I feared the pancake might become too dense, I increased the number of eggs in the batter to help it rise and puff.\n\nI mixed in a little black pepper to contrast with the sweetness of the corn, and then simmered together a speedy blackberry syrup to drizzle on top. The recipe is versatile enough to make over and over, and I\u2019m sure it will take me through the end of corn season.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/22/dining/22APPE_SPAN/22APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "blackberries, corn, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 136}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 432, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "175 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup fine cornmeal", "5 large eggs", "1/3 cup whole milk", "2 tablespoons honey", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "3/4 cup fresh corn kernels (from 1 to 2 ears)", "2 cups fresh blackberries", "3 tablespoons sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
