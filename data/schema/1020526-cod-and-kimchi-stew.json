{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cod and Kimchi Stew", "description": "Kimchi is a seriously versatile kitchen staple because it\u2019s packed with so many flavors and textures. It\u2019s great chopped and folded into mayonnaise, cooked with your favorite taco filling or stirred in to sauces and soups. In this recipe, it takes center stage as the base for an umami-rich broth. Once cooked, the kimchi is tender and provides a counterpoint to perfectly poached cod. For a heartier meal, serve it over steamed rice and top it with a fried egg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
