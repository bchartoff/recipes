{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butternut Squash and Bacon Risotto", "description": "The classic risotto technique applies here, though with a frugal twist. I blended the cooking liquid for the butternut squash and about half of the diced cooked squash itself to produce my vegetable broth. The rest of the diced squash is folded in near the end of cooking. A generous helping of smoked bacon gives the result main-dish heft. This risotto does not need a final dollop of butter or a dusting of cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/13/dining/06PARING/06PARING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "bacon, butternut squash, dry white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 237}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 416, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "821 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large butternut squash, about 3 pounds, peeled, cored and diced in 1/2-inch pieces", "Salt", "6 ounces thick-sliced smoked bacon", "1 cup finely chopped onion", "1 teaspoon ground sage", "1 1/2 cups arborio rice", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "Ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon fresh sage leaves, slivered"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place squash in a saucepan with 4 cups salted water.
