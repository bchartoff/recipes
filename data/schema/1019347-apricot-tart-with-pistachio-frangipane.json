{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apricot Tart With Pistachio Frangipane", "description": "This tart requires a time commitment: There are several elements, and while each is simple, they need to be prepared and cooled before the tart is assembled. But it pays back in complexity of flavor and by looking particularly impressive. It will make a remarkable dessert at the end of a lavish summer feast. You can start the day before, making all the elements and baking the frangipane and apricots in the tart. Once it has cooled completely, wrap it in plastic wrap overnight. The next day, fill with the cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re and top with the remaining ingredients.\u00a0Other light dessert wines can be used instead of Sauternes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/dining/13ottorex1/13ottorex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "apricot, marzipan, pistachio, Sauternes, vanilla bean paste, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "recipeIngredient": ["All-butter pie dough, enough for 1 tart crust (either <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019240-sweet-tart-crust\">homemade</a> or one 7- or 8-ounce/200-gram package, thawed if frozen)", "Butter, for greasing the pan", "Scant 1/2 cup/100 milliliters Sauternes", "1/2 lime", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla bean paste (or 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract)", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar or caster sugar", "6 medium ripe apricots (about 2/3 pound/280 grams), halved and pitted", "1 scant cup/100 grams raw unsalted pistachios, toasted in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit/170 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes, until fragrant", "1/4 cup/75 grams good-quality marzipan", "1 egg, plus 1 yolk", "5 tablespoons/75 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar or caster sugar", "1 tablespoon cornstarch (cornflour)", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste (or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract)", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "4 tablespoons/50 grams granulated sugar or caster sugar", "1 tablespoon cornstarch (cornflour)", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour (plain flour)", "4 egg yolks", "1 1/4 cup/300 milliliters whole milk", "2 tablespoons/30 grams unsalted butter", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste (or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract)", "1/4 teaspoon orange blossom water", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar or caster sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start with the pastry shell: Heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit/190 degrees Celsius.
