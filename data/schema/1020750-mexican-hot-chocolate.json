{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mexican Hot Chocolate", "description": "Mesoamerican women are believed to be the first to ferment and roast cacao beans, a crucial step in chocolate making that is still used thousands of years later. Then, it was prepared as a frothy, unsweetened drink for rituals and medicinal purposes. Later, Spanish colonists brought the ingredient back to Spain, where sugar, cinnamon and vanilla were added, making it more similar to the spicy-sweet beverage we know today. This recipe is adapted from Churrer\u00eda El Moro, a restaurant in Mexico City known for churros and hot chocolate. To get the signature foamy top, use a molinillo, a Mexican wooden whisk, or a wire whisk to make it light and frothy. And while it\u2019s not traditional, you can also put the hot chocolate in a blender for about 2 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kiera Wright-Ruiz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/23/dining/kwr-mexican-hot-chocolate/kwr-mexican-hot-chocolate-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "chocolate, cinnamon, milk, sugar, vanilla, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 134}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups whole milk", "2 (4-inch) cinnamon sticks (preferably Ceylon)", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "8 ounces dark chocolate (preferably 70 percent)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, combine milk, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla.
