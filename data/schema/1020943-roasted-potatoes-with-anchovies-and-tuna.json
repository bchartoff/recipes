{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Potatoes With Anchovies and Tuna", "description": "In this pantry-friendly recipe, golden, crackling-skinned potatoes move from side dish to main course after being tossed with tuna, capers and a pungent sauce of anchovies melted in brown butter. It\u2019s extremely adaptable. If you don\u2019t have (or like) tuna, use chickpeas or white beans instead. Just don\u2019t skimp on the onion, which adds a crisp sweetness to the potatoes. With their slightly thicker skins, fingerlings work especially well here, but use whatever you\u2019ve got.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/25/dining/20apperex/merlin_170424801_860befa0-8049-4fde-9450-d0db4ca02451-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, seafood, vegetables", "keywords": "anchovies, beans, onion, potato, tuna, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 383}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds baby or fingerling potatoes", "Kosher salt", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for roasting", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 stick)", "1 (2-ounce) tin anchovies, chopped (about 10 to 12 anchovies)", "1 tablespoon capers, drained", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 (5- to 6-ounce) can or jar tuna, drained and flaked, or 1 (13-ounce) can chickpeas or white beans, drained", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "Fresh lemon juice, to taste", "1 cup chopped soft herbs, including parsley, celery leaves and dill (optional)", "1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion, shallot or scallion"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, cover potatoes with at least 1 inch of water, and add a generous amount of salt.
