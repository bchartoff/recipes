Instead, he takes wings from chickens that have been killed just hours earlier, and he gives them a gentle grilling so that nothing interferes with the essential flavor of the meat. The marinade? Just four ingredients that quietly mingle like old friends at a cocktail party. \u201cSo easy,\u201d Mr. Kim said.
