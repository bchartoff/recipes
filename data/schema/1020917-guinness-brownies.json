{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Guinness Brownies", "description": "The earthy flavors of stout beer pair perfectly with three kinds of chocolate in these dense, fudgy brownies. You can use bittersweet or semisweet, bars or chips, depending on what you have on hand, but this recipe is at its best using bar chocolate because of its meltability. A sprinkling of milk chocolate chips before baking is a sweet counterpoint to the rich, complex brownies. Do not overbake them: When the brownies are done, they will appear just set in the center and on the verge of underbaked. They\u2019ll set further as they cool. Chilling the brownies makes them easier to cut, but allow them to come to room temperature before serving for the best flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/ejm-guinness-brownies/merlin_170016606_5359a8c1-0a6b-480d-a3b1-d65608f4f2e0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pan (16 brownies)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars, finger foods", "keywords": "beer, chocolate, cocoa powder, espresso coffee powder, guinness, guinness stout, milk chocolate chips, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 167}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick spray", "1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/30 grams unsweetened cocoa powder", "1 tablespoon instant espresso powder (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "12 ounces/340 grams finely chopped bar bittersweet or semisweet chocolate", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters stout beer, at room temperature", "8 ounces/225 grams milk chocolate chips (or other chocolate chips, if you prefer)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
