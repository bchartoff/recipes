{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Swiss Chard and Lamb Torte With Fennel-Pomegranate Relish", "description": "Festive dishes in Israel and throughout the Middle East often include rice and lamb. This magnificent recipe, topped with a bright pomegranate and fennel relish, is the Israeli chef Erez Komarovsky's twist on an ancient, labor-intensive classic of individual stuffed chard, cabbage or grape leaves, symbolizing the plenty of the fall harvest. It is perfect for Rosh Hashana or any seasonal holiday gathering. Make it with blanched Swiss chard, grape leaves or even cabbage or kale as the outer crust, and assemble it a day in advance. Then bake it and revel in the heightened flavors from the cardamom, cinnamon, fennel and mint; the crunch of pistachio; and the slight kick you get from the Mexican Serrano pepper now planted in Israel.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/13/dining/13ROSHRECIPE/13ROSHRECIPE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, meat, project", "keywords": "fennel, lamb, mint, pomegranate, rice, Serrano chile pepper, swiss chard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 539, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "808 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/3 cups medium-grain or sushi rice (1 pound)", "About 10 to 12 large green Swiss chard leaves (from 1 to 2 bunches)", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 medium onions, finely chopped", "1 pound ground lamb", "3/4 cup roasted shelled pistachios", "1 tablespoon kosher or coarse sea salt", "2 1/4 teaspoons ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 tablespoon fennel seeds", "1/2 cup chopped mint leaves", "4 cups chicken stock", "2 fennel bulbs, roughly chopped (reserve fronds for decorating torte)", "1 Serrano chile pepper", "Juice of 2 freshly squeezed lemons (about 6 tablespoons)", "4 tablespoons pomegranate syrup", "2 cups pomegranate seeds", "Kosher or coarse sea salt, to taste", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the torte: Place rice in a heat-proof bowl.
