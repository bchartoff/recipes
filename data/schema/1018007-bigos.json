This version, adapted from Monika Woods, is rich with meat but heightened with caraway balanced by the tartness of sauerkraut, tomato and sweet fresh cabbage. Woods's mother makes it with the ends and scraps of meat saved and frozen over months\u2019 worth of meals, so feel free to experiment with different cuts. Smoky kielbasa is the only necessary constant.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Francis Lam"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/06/magazine/06eat/06eat-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beef short ribs, cabbage, carrot, kielbasa, pork shoulder, sauerkraut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 461, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1011 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound beef short-rib meat, boneless (see note), cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "Vegetable oil, as needed", "1 pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch chunks", "3/4 pound smoked kielbasa, cut into 1/2-inch coins", "4 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 1/2 tablespoons whole caraway seed", "1 teaspoon ground allspice", "1 large onion, sliced 1/4-inch thin", "3 medium carrots, grated", "32 ounces canned diced tomatoes, with juice", "1 pound cabbage, sliced 1/4-inch thin", "1 pound sauerkraut", "3 bay leaves", "Rye bread, for serving."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the beef very dry with paper towel.

(This is my preference.) At 6 hours, which is more traditional, the meat will be falling apart into the cabbage. Adjust seasoning with salt or pepper to taste, and serve with rye bread."}]}
