I use drained, canned smoked trout packed in oil (although it doesn\u2019t have to be packed in oil). Don\u2019t forget to squeeze on a little lemon juice when you serve these; it\u2019s a perfect touch. The trout is an excellent source of omega-3 fats.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/29/business/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Two servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, healthy, smoked trout, swiss chard", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 365, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "912 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound Swiss chard", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, 1 minced, 1 cut in half", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "2 thick slices whole-grain country bread (about 2 ounces each)", "4 ounces smoked trout", "Lemon wedges for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stem the chard, and wash the leaves and stems in two rinses of water.
