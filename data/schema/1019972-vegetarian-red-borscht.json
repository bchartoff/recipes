{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian Red Borscht", "description": "A traditional vegetable soup made for centuries throughout Eastern Europe and well loved in Russia and Poland, borscht has origins in present-day Ukraine. There are white versions, made with potatoes and cabbage, and green versions, made with sorrel and spinach. Most familiar, though, is the red version, made with beets.
