But when it is tossed in a little oil, well-seasoned and simmered in broth, it produces a toothsome graininess, not as nutty as bulgur but more interesting than couscous. Leftovers make a great grain salad the next day: think tabbouleh and add masses of freshly chopped herbs, a judicious amount of good olive oil and a spritz of lemon juice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/03/dining/Spiced-and-Herbed-Millet/Spiced-and-Herbed-Millet-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch", "keywords": "gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, millet, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 429, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "235 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons olive oil", "2 1/2 cups millet", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "4 cups vegetable or chicken broth", "Juice of half a lemon", "1/4 cup chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.
