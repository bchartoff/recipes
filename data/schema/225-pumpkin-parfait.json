{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Parfait", "description": "This no-bake dessert, inspired by an idea from my colleague Suzanne Hamlin, does require a few hours in the freezer. Still, the active working time is about 20 minutes. You start with canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e, stir in cream, milk and spices, and freeze. Several hours (or days) later -- when you're ready for dessert -- you cut up the frozen pur\u00e9e and put it into the food processor, which makes it smooth and creamy. Layer this ingenious creation with lightly whipped cream if you like \u2013 or not.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/01/dining/01COOKING-PUMPKIN-PARFAIT/01COOKING-PUMPKIN-PARFAIT-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, custards and puddings", "keywords": "dessert, fall, heavy cream, milk, pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 135}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 260, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "28 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (15-ounce) can pur\u00e9ed pumpkin (about 1 3/4 cups)", "2 cups heavy cream, divided", "3/4 cup whole milk", "3/4\u00a0cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ginger", "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "2 tablespoons rum"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, 3/4 cup cream, milk, 3/4 cup sugar, spices and rum.
