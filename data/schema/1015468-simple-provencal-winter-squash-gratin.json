There\u2019s little more than squash here, seasoned with lots of garlic and fresh herbs. Dicing all the squash takes time, but then the work is just about done. If you want to use a food processor, you can, but you can\u2019t get even pieces that way. The recipe is based on one of my favorite recipes in Richard Olney\u2019s book \u201cSimple French Food.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/02/science/02recipehealth/02recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, kosher, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 129}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 162, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "574 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds winter squash (like 1 large butternut), peeled, seeds and membranes removed, cut in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch dice", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 cup bread crumbs", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
