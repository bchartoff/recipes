Dandelion greens are very nice here, but you can usually only find them in a farmers\u2019 market; kale, especially dark green cavolo nero, is a fine substitute.

The stock should just cover the rice and should be bubbling, not too slowly but not too quickly. Cook, stirring often, until it is just about absorbed. Add another ladleful or two of the stock and continue to cook in this fashion, adding more stock and stirring when the rice is almost dry. You do not have to stir constantly, but stir often. After 10 to 15 minutes stir in the dandelion greens and kale with the next addition of stock. When the rice is just tender all the way through but still chewy, usually about 25 minutes after you begin cooking, it is done.
