It\u2019s a simple, homey confection that works as well with a cup of afternoon tea as it does for dessert. Feel free to substitute other flavors of tart jam for the raspberry. Apricot and blackberry work particularly well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/18/dining/19VICTORIA-SPONGE-CAKE/19VICTORIA-SPONGE-CAKE-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, heavy cream, raspberry jam, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 549}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 461, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "252 milligrams", "sugarContent": "41 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened, more for greasing pan", "1 1/3 cups/166 grams all-purpose flour", "3 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/175 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons whole milk", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters raspberry jam, more to taste", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 tablespoon confectioners\u2019 sugar, more for dusting", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and place a rack in the center.
