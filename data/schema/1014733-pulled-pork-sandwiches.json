{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pulled Pork Sandwiches", "description": "This recipe takes a good deal of time, but it yields a lot of sandwiches, more than enough for a sloppy, spicy dinner party feast. You\u2019ll roast a dry-rubbed pork shoulder in the oven until it\u2019s pull-apart tender, 3 or 4 hours that you can spend doing other things while your kitchen fills with the aroma of the cooking meat. Then you\u2019ll assemble a quick slaw and simmer a tangy barbecue sauce for about 10 minutes before putting it all out on the table with soft rolls. Serve the combination warm, at any time of the year, for a weekend project well worth an afternoon\u2019s work.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/03/dining/03COOKING-PULLEDPORKSANDWICH/03COOKING-PULLEDPORKSANDWICH-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "lunch, project, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "boneless pork shoulder, cabbage, spices, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 953}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons whole coriander seed", "1 1/2 teaspoons whole cumin seed", "1 1/2 teaspoons black peppercorns", "2 1/4 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons chile powder", "3 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "3 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder", "Hamburger or brioche buns, for serving", "1 1/2 cups ketchup", "1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar", "2 tablespoons molasses", "2 garlic cloves, minced or grated", "1/4 cup cider vinegar", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "2 teaspoons sweet or hot paprika", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon dry mustard powder", "Pinch of cayenne", "Dash of hot sauce, more to taste", "1 small head green cabbage, outer leaves removed, shredded (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced", "1 large jalape\u00f1o, seeded if desired, thinly sliced", "3/4 cup mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons cider vinegar", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Assemble the spice rub for the pork: In a dry, small skillet over medium-low heat, toast coriander, cumin and peppercorns until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
