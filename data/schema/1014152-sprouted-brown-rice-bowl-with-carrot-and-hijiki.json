But it\u2019s the flavor and texture of this new sprout that have gotten me hooked. If you\u2019ve been hard pressed to get your family to embrace brown rice, this may be the way to go. Julienne carrots with hijiki seaweed is a traditional Japanese combination. Here I\u2019ve added some tofu to bulk up the protein. Hijiki is an excellent source of iodine, vitamin K, folate and magnesium; the seaweed is soaked and simmered before cooking with the carrot and aromatics.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/12/science/11recipehealth/11recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves three to four", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "carrot, firm tofu, sprouted brown rice, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 358, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "331 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 ounce (about 1/2 cup) dried hijiki", "1 tablespoon soy sauce, preferably tamari more to taste", "2 teaspoons mirin", "1 tablespoon peanut oil or canola oil", "1/2 pound firm tofu, cut in 1/2-by-1-inch dominoes", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon shredded or minced ginger", "1/2 pound (2 large) carrots, cut in 2- or 3-inch long julienne", "Salt to taste optional", "1 1/2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds", "3 cups cooked sprouted brown rice", "1 tablespoon dark sesame oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the hijiki in a medium bowl, and cover with water.
