It\u2019s just a case of making the various elements separately; a day in advance, if you like, in the case of the pears (which benefit from being soaked overnight in the syrup) and the kataifi pastry bases (which can be baked one day ahead; let them cool, then keep them in a sealed container at room temperature). That leaves just the cream to whip, the syrup to reduce and the assembly to do before serving. The joy of calling something a nest is that it does not need to look perfectly neat and intact. A stray strand of pastry here and there is absolutely fine. Kataifi pastry can be found in the freezer section at Middle Eastern supermarkets.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/08/dining/08BAKING2/08BAKING2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastries", "keywords": "dessert, feta, kataifi pastry, mascarpone, pear, pistachio, saffron", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 102}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 403, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "165 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/100 grams granulated or superfine sugar (caster sugar)", "2 star anise", "2 cinnamon sticks", "5 cardamom pods", "Pinch of saffron", "Zest from 1 medium lemon, cut in wide strips", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus 1 tablespoon for the syrup", "2 medium ripe Bartlett or Williams pears, peeled (3/4 pound/360 grams)", "5 ounces/150 grams kataifi pastry, defrosted if frozen", "5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, melted", "4 teaspoons honey", "3 tablespoons/25 grams shelled pistachios, slivered or roughly chopped", "1/2 cup/110 grams mascarpone cheese", "1/2 cup/55 grams finely crumbled feta, lightly packed", "3 tablespoons/40 grams granulated or superfine sugar (caster sugar)", "Generous pinch of saffron, soaked in 1 tablespoon boiling water", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream (double cream)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Poach the pears: Place sugar, spices, lemon zest and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a small saucepan.
