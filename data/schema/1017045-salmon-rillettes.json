{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon Rillettes", "description": "A light but rich tasting spread made with fresh and smoked salmon. This is my adaptation of David Lebovitz\u2019s  adaptation of Susan Loomis\u2019s salmon rillettes, a recipe that I have been wanting to make for years. A more buttery version is in Susan Loomis\u2019s wonderful book \u201cCooking at Home on Rue Tatin,\u201d and on <a href=\" http://www.davidlebovitz.com/about/\">David Lebovitz\u2019s</a> eponymous website. David uses a mixture of steamed fresh salmon and smoked salmon, and I have followed suit, changing the proportions slightly. I used much less butter \u2013 1 tablespoon, and a tablespoon each of olive oil and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, as well as some Greek yogurt, and I still came up with a mixture that I can call rillettes. You can serve the spread with sliced bread or crackers, spoon onto endive leaves, cucumber rounds or squares of red and green pepper, or use as a filling for miniature bell peppers. You can also substitute these salmon rillettes for the smoked trout rillettes in the recipe for \u201cLentils With Smoked Trout Rillettes\u201d from earlier this week. As always, use a fork, not a food processor, to make this.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/06/science/11recipehealth/11recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 3/4 cups, serving 8 generously", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low-carb, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 95}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 105, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "137 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 6-ounce salmon fillet, bones removed", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "5 ounces smoked salmon, cut into thin strips, then into 1/4-inch pieces", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "4 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (or omit and use 5 tablespoons yogurt)", "1 1-2 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "2 tablespoons chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly oil a steamer basket.
