{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bits and Pieces Party Cheese Ball", "description": "The cheese ball is a stalwart of the Midwest cocktail party, where it can be fashioned from processed Cheddar cheese and port wine, or pineapple and cream cheese. This recipe relies on the leftover ends of good cheese or even just one kind of good-quality, sharp cheese like Gruy\u00e8re. The idea of adding butter comes from Vivian Howard, the North Carolina chef who features a cheese ball with blue cheese, chopped dates and bacon in her cookbook \"Deep Run Roots.\" She calls hers a party magnet, and indeed, for all of the shade thrown at cheese balls, they are often the first thing to be eaten. They can be served with chutney, jam or simply alongside the best-quality crackers you can find.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "KIm Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/07/dining/07CHEESBALL1/07CHEESBALL1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 12-ounce cheese ball, about 8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, cream cheese, fish sauce, goat cheese, gruy\u00e8re, pecan, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 424}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 174, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "202 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons good-quality salted butter", "1 cup shredded sharp, flavorful cheese, in any combination that might include Gruy\u00e8re, Cheddar or blue cheese", "3 ounces fresh goat cheese", "4 ounces cream cheese", "1 heaping tablespoon finely chopped scallions", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne", "1/4 teaspoon fish sauce", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1/3 cup chopped, salted roasted pecans", "1 heaping tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Allow the butter and cheeses to come to room temperature.
