{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Pork Loin With Herbs, Cumin and Garlic", "description": "Pork loin is an excellent cut to grill for a crowd. The cut is larger and more marbled with fat than a lean tenderloin, which is entirely different and should not be used as a substitute in this recipe. The pork loin has a richer flavor and meatier texture. Butterflying a loin helps it cook quickly and relatively evenly over direct heat, which is the easiest way to go on the grill. If you\u2019d rather cook this in the oven, you can broil the meat: Place the pork, opened and flat, on a rimmed baking sheet, and broil it on low for 7 to 12 minutes per side, until done to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/30/dining/30APPE1/30APPE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H40M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "basil, cumin, garlic, parsley, pork loin, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 205}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 314, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "417 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 to 4 pounds boneless pork loin, trimmed of some but not all fat", "Grated zest and juice of 2 lemons, plus more lemon wedges for serving", "8 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1/3 cup packed fresh basil leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish", "1/3 cup packed parsley leaves and tender stems", "3 tablespoons fresh marjoram or oregano leaves", "3 tablespoons cilantro leaves and tender stems", "2 tablespoons thyme leaves, plus more for garnish", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "Large pinch red pepper flakes, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butterfly the pork by slicing through it horizontally until you almost cut through, but leaving it attached on one side.
