The whole dip \u2014 from caramelizing cauliflower to stirring together the creamy hot sauce base and baking on the generous layer of cheese \u2014 is made in one pan. You can bring the pan right to the table with dippers of choice and watch it disappear. Just because classic dishes are made a certain way \u2014 and Buffalo wings have a cult following, no doubt! \u2014 don\u2019t be afraid to riff on them once in awhile. That's how new classics are made.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/dining/as-buffalo-cauliflower/as-buffalo-cauliflower-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, blue cheese, cauliflower, cheddar, cream cheese, hot sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 347}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 215, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "709 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small head cauliflower (about 1 1/2 pounds), cored and cut into small florets (about 4 cups)", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup Buffalo-style hot sauce, such as Frank\u2019s", "4 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces and softened (about 1/2 cup)", "1/4 cup sour cream", "1/2 cup freshly shredded Cheddar (about 2 ounces)", "1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese (about 1 ounce)", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped chives or scallions, or to taste", "Celery sticks, carrot sticks, bread, potato chips or tortilla chips, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
