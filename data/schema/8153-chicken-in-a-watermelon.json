It\u2019s an unconventional recipe, with roots in Hawaii and meant to surprise. (Step 5 encourages cooks to show the full chicken and watermelon to guests before carving.) Do, as one commenter suggests, and have someone on hand to record the reactions. And what to do with the leftover watermelon pulp?
