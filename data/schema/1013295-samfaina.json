{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Samfaina", "description": "This Catalan dish is akin to ratatouille, the French dish that rummages around in the summer garden to combine eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, tomatoes and onions in a pot that simmers over low heat. The vegetables soften and collapse into one another, and the flavors meld. Samfaina goes further, though: The ingredients are chopped into very small pieces, then cooked for several hours until the mixture is so thick and caramelized that it almost resembles a vegetable marmalade. It\u2019s often used as a sauce for rabbit, chicken or salt cod, but it can also be a side dish unto itself. It is a time investment \u2014 lots of chopping to be done before hours of cooking and simmering \u2014 but your efforts will yield dinner for the rest of the week. The samfaina will taste better the next day, and it\u2019s delicious hot or cold. Spoon it on a saut\u00e9ed or grilled piece of fish, grilled sausages, poached eggs or a thick piece of toast.
