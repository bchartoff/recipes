{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Le Grand Aioli", "description": "For those interactive group-gathering festive meals that first come to mind \u2014 fondue, say, or raclette \u2014 you either have to maintain a giant heated stone by an even larger roaring fire or a balance a pot of boiling oil, molten cheese or finicky chocolate over a live flame. Le grand aioli, by contrast, is a distinctly relaxing, convivial and participatory group meal that requires no dangerous apparatus: It\u2019s just a vivid spread of vegetables, simply cooked, and a few pieces of steamed seafood to go with the large quantity of rather garlicky mayonnaise. Since the meal is served at room temperature \u2013 neither hot nor cold \u2013 it is one of those exceedingly-gentle-on-the-cook meals for which you can just sit down and stay down. The only exertion involved once you set it out is passing the cold wine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/10/magazine/10eat1/10eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "baby zucchini, cod, French breakfast radish, green beans, mussles, potato, white wine, yellow wax beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 125}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds cod fillets, skin removed", "Kosher salt", "1 pound baby red or mixed beets, trimmed and scrubbed", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar", "14-16 new or fingerling potatoes, scrubbed", "1/2 pound green beans, stem end trimmed", "1/2 pound yellow wax beans, stem end trimmed", "1 pound baby zucchini", "6 eggs", "1 bunch French breakfast radish, large leaves trimmed", "3 heads gem lettuce", "2 pounds mussels", "1 clove garlic, slivered", "1 shallot, chopped", "3 sprigs thyme", "Pinch of red chile flakes", "1/2 cup white wine", "3 cloves garlic, plus more to taste", "1 large egg", "1 large egg yolk", "Juice of 1 lemon, plus more to taste", "Kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups blended oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On the night before you serve the grand aioli, gently season the cod with kosher salt on both sides; cover, and refrigerate overnight."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400.
