{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Hash With Bacon and Melted Onions", "description": "In his home-cooking book \u201cAd Hoc at Home,\u201d the surgically precise chef Thomas Keller gives instructions for cooking onions ideally for hash: melted but not mush, sweet but not stringy. His meat of choice is bacon, a nice shortcut for home cooks who may not have a haunch of beef around. This is an adaptation of his recipe. True to Keller form, this is not a weekday breakfast dish (it will take you a good 20 minutes to cook down the onions, and you'll dirty a few pots), but it is well worth an hour or so of your Sunday morning.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/17/dining/17COOKING-SWEET-POTATO-HASH1/17COOKING-SWEET-POTATO-HASH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch", "keywords": "bacon, sweet potato, gluten-free, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 47}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 cups sliced onions (3 large ones)", "Kosher salt", "1 bay leaf", "4 sprigs thyme", "10 black peppercorns", "1 garlic clove, smashed and peeled", "1 stick unsalted butter, in 8 pieces", "12 ounces best-quality bacon, sliced about 1/2-inch thick", "3 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled, cooked (boiled, roasted or microwaved) and diced", "1 tablespoon minced chives", "Poached or sunny-side-up eggs, for serving optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put onions in a large skillet, place over medium-low heat, and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt.
