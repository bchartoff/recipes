{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pur\u00e9ed Trahana and Vegetable Soup", "description": "Sweet and tart flavors marry in this thick, comforting soup made with leeks, carrots, onion and trahana. I like to blend the soup with an immersion blender, which results in a pur\u00e9e with a fair amount of texture. You can make a smoother, more elegant soup if you use a blender and then strain the pur\u00e9e. Trahana has a rustic flavor that goes well here. If you use semolina or flour trahana the mixture will be considerably thicker, so use less; half as much should be fine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/21/science/23recipehealth/23recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "greek, mediterranean, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 6}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 181, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "805 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 large red or yellow onion, chopped", "Salt to taste", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "3/4 pound carrots, diced", "2 large leeks, white and light green parts only, rinsed of all sand and chopped", "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016876-homemade-sour-bulgur-trahana-from-ikaria\">1 1/2 cups sour bulgur trahana</a>", "2 quarts vegetable stock, chicken stock or water", "A bouquet garni made with a bay leaf and a couple of sprigs each parsley and thyme or oregano", "Freshly ground pepper", "Additional olive oil and chopped fresh herbs such as dill, parsley or mint, for garnish", "Red pepper flakes or cayenne for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons of   olive oil over medium heat in a heavy soup pot and add onion.
