{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hot Toddy", "description": "Whether you\u2019re sick in bed or fresh off the slopes, a hot toddy warms everything up. The classic formula of whiskey, sugar and hot water is like the steamy cousin of an old-fashioned, but these days, a lot of other ingredients (citrus juice, apple cider, various spices) get added in the name of innovation, with mixed results. This version cozies up to the original, with a few optional additions based on preference. First, warm the mug with hot water, which primes the vessel to hold heat longer, yielding a truly hot toddy to the last sip. Then add scotch or bourbon, or for a modern twist, rum, cognac or amaro. Stir in a little honey, maple syrup or Demerara sugar, add hot water and stir to dissolve. Garnish with lemon peel and spices, if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/dining/rp-hot-toddy/rp-hot-toddy-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cinnamon stick, honey, lemon peel, star anise, whiskey, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "recipeIngredient": ["Boiling water, as needed", "2 ounces scotch, bourbon, rye, Irish whiskey, dark rum, cognac or amaro", "3/4 ounce light honey, such as acacia, or maple syrup (or 1 teaspoon Demerara sugar)", "1 (3-inch) lemon peel", "Cinnamon stick and whole star anise, to garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a 6-ounce heatproof mug or glass with boiling water and set aside, 1 minute.
