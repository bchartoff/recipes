{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Cutlets With Mushroom Dressing", "description": "This French-inspired chicken dish isn\u2019t exactly weeknight fare, but it is sophisticated comfort food that is well worth the effort. First, boneless chicken thighs or breasts are pounded into cutlets, marinated in garlic, lemon juice and thyme (up to 6 hours, but even a short sit will do nicely), then breaded and fried. They are then dressed in a rich yet delightfully piquant sauce of mushrooms, shallots, garlic, Dijon mustard, white wine and balsamic vinegar that is a welcome contrast to the richness of the fried chicken. Serve with a crisp green salad (and a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013511-potato-leek-gratin\">potato gratin</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018512-pommes-anna\">pommes Anna</a> if you're feeling particularly ambitious). If you\u2019d prefer to fry the chicken 30 minutes or so in advance and keep it in the oven at 175 degrees, that\u2019ll work beautifully. As for what to drink, this dish pairs perfectly with the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/dining/wine-review-cote-chalonnaise-reds.html\">pinot noirs of the C\u00f4te Chalonnaise</a> on the southern end of Burgundy.
