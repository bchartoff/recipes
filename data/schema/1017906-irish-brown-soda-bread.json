{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Irish Brown Soda Bread", "description": "When baking soda was introduced in the early 19th century, Irish home cooks adopted the product almost immediately. With soda, a loaf of bread could be ready in as little as one hour, as opposed to using yeast or sourdough starters, which require rising time. The recipe is a slight adaptation of one by the Irish cookbook author Rachel Allen. It is most delicious freshly baked, and best toasted the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/30/dining/30KITCH2/30KITCH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 loaf", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "buttermilk, whole wheat flour, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 299}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 278, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "290 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/288 grams whole wheat flour", "1 3/4  cups/224 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "2 tablespoons/28 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1 egg", "1 2/3 cups/395 milliliters buttermilk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
