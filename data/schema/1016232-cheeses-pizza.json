{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheeses Pizza", "description": "This is a pizza reimagining of the classic Roman pasta dish cacio e pepe, pasta served with only cheese and black pepper. It came to The Times from the kitchens of Roberta\u2019s restaurant in Brooklyn, a pizzeria and lifestyle collective that occupies a number of buildings and lots in a far corner of the Bushwick neighborhood. Cream slicks the dough, and a mixture of mozzarella and tangy taleggio tops it. A shocking amount of freshly ground black pepper follows that application and, after the pizza is cooked, a shower of grated Parmesan. A drizzle of honey over the top would not be blasphemy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/09/dining/09JPPIZZA1/09JPPIZZA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "appetizer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 379}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 549, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1255 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 12-inch round of pizza dough, stretched <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016230-robertas-pizza-dough\">(see recipe)</a>", "4 teaspoons heavy cream", "2 ounces fresh mozzarella", "1 1/2 ounces fresh taleggio", "Ground black pepper", "1 ounce Parmesan, finely grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn heat to its highest setting.
