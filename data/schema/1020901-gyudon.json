{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gyudon", "description": "A popular fast-food dish in Japan, gyudon is a quick-simmered mixture of thinly sliced beef and crisp-tender onions cooked in a sweet soy broth that\u2019s seasoned with fresh ginger. It\u2019s perfectly suited to weeknight cooking because it requires minimal prep, a short ingredient list and less than 30 minutes of active cooking. Gyudon owes its popularity to Yoshinoya, Japan\u2019s first fast-food chain, which was founded in Tokyo in 1899 and became wildly successful in the 1960s serving just this dish. Variations abound \u2014 this recipe borrows heavily from the chef Ivan Orkin\u2019s recipe, as well as one featured in \u201cSimply Bento\u201d by Yuko \u2014 and while some skip the use of dashi, a Japanese stock using bonito flakes and seaweed, the ingredient gives the dish a slight funk that offsets the sweetness of the mirin, sake and ginger. The flavor is subtle, but it\u2019s missed when absent.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/25/dining/aw-gyudon/aw-gyudon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice, meat, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef, dashi, ginger, mirin, onion, sake, soy sauce, sugar, dairy-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 185}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound boneless beef rib-eye, excess fat trimmed", "1 1/4 teaspoons instant dashi granules, such as Hondashi", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup sake", "3 tablespoons mirin", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 medium yellow onion (about 9 ounces), halved, then thinly sliced from stem to stem", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger", "Cooked sushi rice (or other white rice), for serving", "Pickled red ginger and togarashi, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut beef crosswise into 2 pieces, then set your beef in the freezer for at least 1 hour to freeze until firm.
