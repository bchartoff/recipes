Don\u2019t overcook the caramel, and make sure that the baking water only simmers, never boils. When mixing the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisk constantly to avoid curdling the eggs. Individual ramekins can be used in place of a charlotte mold, but dial back the cooking time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Child"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/12/dining/juliacaramel-still/juliacaramel-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 263, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "65 milligrams", "sugarContent": "43 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 2/3 cup sugar", "2 cups milk", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 large eggs", "4 large egg yolks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the pan on the stove over medium heat, and bring the water to a simmer. Transfer the pan to the oven. (The water should stay at a low simmer at all times; do not let it boil or the custard will overcook.) Bake until a knife inserted into the center of the custard comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Keep the custard in the baking pan until the water cools. Remove from the pan to finish cooling. To serve, run the tip of a knife around the top of the custard to loosen it. Invert a serving platter over the mold and quickly turn it over again. Carefully remove the mold."}]}
