This was a day\u2019s work, but with the arrival of good-quality puff pastry on the market, modern bakers can quickly (\u201caylenish\u201d in Yiddish) produce this close cousin: a sweet, fragrant filling of nuts, spices and dried fruit wrapped in rich dough. Orange marmalade gives a tart undertone (and the faintest suggestion of a Christmas fruitcake), but apricot or raspberry jam are also considered classic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/03/dining/03COOKFIGHT6/03COOKFIGHT6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 4 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert, golden raisins, orange marmalade, puff pastry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 49}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 89, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "49 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/55 grams golden raisins", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters rum (optional)", "2 tablespoons/25 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "2 tablespoons/30 grams dark brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg, preferably fresh", "1/2 cup/60 grams chopped toasted walnuts", "Salt", "1 cup/340 grams orange marmalade", "About 1 pound/500 grams puff pastry", "1 egg yolk, whisked with a splash of milk or water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak raisins in rum and 1/2 cup very hot water.
