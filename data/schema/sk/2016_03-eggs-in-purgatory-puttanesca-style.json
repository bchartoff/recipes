Let me make It clear: it is. Not because you can make authentic puttanesca without them, but because if you\u2019re in your own kitchen, cooking for yourself and not, say, an Italian cooking school textbook, and they\u2019re not your thing, you should feel confident that if you skip them, this sauce will still have an abundance of salty zing. Me, I\u2019ve come around to them, but if I hadn\u2019t a tin already open from a recent Caesar bender, I wouldn\u2019t run back to the store on a Monday night to make this. This food is about convenience and comfort; all that matters is that you pull that off.\nWe had this with a side of roasted cauliflower and I thoroughly enjoyed dabbing sauce on the florets, wondering if this should be a thing. And just like that, I was catching up on Rachel Roddy\u2019s excellent columns in The Guardian last night and she\u2019s already on it. This is a great option for someone who doesn\u2019t eat eggs. \nYou could very easily amp up the vegetable component with 1 cup of thinly sliced mushrooms, sauteed for a couple minutes in the beginning with the olives and other ingredients, or with 1 cup of spinach, arugula or another leafy green of your choice, added right before the egg(s) and cooked until wilted (1 minute for spinach or arugula, longer for heartier leaves). \nIf you\u2019re making this as a puttanesca to go over pasta, you\u2019ll want to double the flavorful stuff. This is slightly milder because it\u2019s eaten straight. \n</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 1 to 4 (for 4 people, it would be 4 smallish one-egg servings)", "recipeIngredient": ["A glug (1 to 2 tablespoons) olive oil, plus extra to finish", "1 to 2 cloves garlic, peeled", "1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, plus extra for garnish", "2 tablespoons pitted black olives", "1 tablespoon capers, drained, rinsed", "1 anchovy filet, minced, or more to taste, if you prefer a heap of them", "1 teaspoon dried oregano or double that of fresh", "1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste", "1 (14-ounce) can diced or crushed tomatoes", "Salt, to taste", "1 to 4 large eggs (shown with 1)", "1/4 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese, plus extra to finish", "A slice of bread of your choice, per egg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>A glug (1 to 2 tablespoons) olive oil, plus extra to finish<br/>\n1 to 2 cloves garlic, peeled<br/>\n1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, plus extra for garnish<br/>\n2 tablespoons pitted black olives<br/>\n1 tablespoon capers, drained, rinsed<br/>\n1 anchovy filet, minced, or more to taste, if you prefer a heap of them<br/>\n1 teaspoon dried oregano or double that of fresh<br/>\n1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste<br/>\n1 (14-ounce) can diced or crushed tomatoes<br/>\nSalt, to taste<br/>\n1 to 4 large eggs (shown with 1)<br/>\n1/4 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese, plus extra to finish<br/>\nA slice of bread of your choice, per egg</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>On a cutting board, pile garlic, 1/4 cup parsley, olives, capers, anchovies (if using), oregano and pepper and run a knife through them again and again until they\u2019re chopped into a tiny rubble.
