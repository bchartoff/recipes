If you\u2019re looking for a new technique, you will delight in the comments. Here, I use my approach, the one that works for me every time. If you rest the eggs in the fridge for a day or so after cooking them, they\u2019re usually easier to peel while keeping the eggs intact. (Although mine, three days old, still were not. Punks.) If you\u2019re not into mayo (I know you\u2019re not, even if I don\u2019t agree), you can use plain Greek yogurt instead. I have you make more celery than you\u2019ll need because trust me, it will get used, as it\u2019s great in everything from tuna to potato salads. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup white wine vinegar", "1/4 cup water", "2 teaspoons Kosher salt (you can go up to 1 tablespoon if using the lighter weight Diamond brand; here\u2019s ", "<a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/tips/2010/06/29/not-all-salts-are-created-equally/\">why</a>", ")", "1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "2 stalks celery, trimmed, diced tiny", "4 large eggs", "1 heaped teaspoon whole-grain Dijon", "2 teaspoons minced shallot or red onion (or more to taste)", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise or full-fat plain yogurt", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "Chopped flat-leaf parsley or fresh dill (to garnish, optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1/4 cup white wine vinegar<br/>\n1/4 cup water<br/>\n2 teaspoons Kosher salt (you can go up to 1 tablespoon if using the lighter weight Diamond brand; here\u2019s <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/tips/2010/06/29/not-all-salts-are-created-equally/\">why</a>)<br/>\n1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar<br/>\n2 stalks celery, trimmed, diced tiny<br/>\n4 large eggs<br/>\n1 heaped teaspoon whole-grain Dijon<br/>\n2 teaspoons minced shallot or red onion (or more to taste)<br/>\n2 tablespoons mayonnaise or full-fat plain yogurt<br/>\nSalt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br/>\nChopped flat-leaf parsley or fresh dill (to garnish, optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pickle your celery: Combine vinegar, water, Kosher salt and sugar in a jar and shake it until the salt and sugar dissolve.
