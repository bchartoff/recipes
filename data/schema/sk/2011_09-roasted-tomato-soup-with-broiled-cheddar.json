(If you\u2019re using a wide bowl, you might find that you want more cheese to create a thick, broiled lid.)  Bake soups on tray for 15 to 20 minutes, until cheese on top is bubbling and brown at the edges. If you\u2019d like it even more bronzed on top, preheat your broiler and finish soups for a minute or two under it.
