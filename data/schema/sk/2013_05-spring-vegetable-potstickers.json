If you\u2019re not into tofu (like this guy I married, but he will still eat it in this or that), here\u2019s a fun alternative: cellophane noodles. I often see these minced in dumplings and think they\u2019d be tasty here too.</p><p>As for the \u201cspring\u201d part, I used asparagus and favas for my potstickers but you should use a mix of whatever vegetables look awesome right now, be they peas or lima beans or more. You\u2019re looking for 3 to 3 1/4 cups total spring vegetables once they\u2019re chopped. </p><p>I (currently) draw the line at making my own potsticker wrappers, but if you feel so inclined, I see a lot of great looking recipes on the web (this one comes recommended by a commenter, below). When buying wrappers, look for ones intended for dumplings, not wontons, if you can. The latter will be thicker.

Asparagus will need about 4 minutes, peas about 2 to 3, and favas and limas will already be tender, so just a minute to warm them.

Make a few small pleats down each sides to seal in the rest of the filling, while trying to press out as much air as possible (a process that looks difficult but is so easy, I think you\u2019ll find it intuitive \u2014 use the photos in the post as guidance).
