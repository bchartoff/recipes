I soaked my ribs in cold water in one batch but not the other and didn\u2019t necessarily notice a difference, but if you have time, it cannot hurt to do so (explained above). I also never tried parboiling the ribs to remove excess fat (usually 5 minutes, then drain the water) but if you do so, let us know how it goes. I skipped Morante\u2019s suggestion of a cornstarch slurry (1 tablespoon each cornstarch and water combined, added to the pot at the end and simmered for a few minutes) to thicken the final sauce; it wasn\u2019t seen in other recipes and I sometimes find that starch-thickened sauce effect unpleasant.
