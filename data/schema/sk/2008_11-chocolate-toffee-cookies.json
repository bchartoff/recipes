Cookies baked straight from the freezer may need an additional minute or two in the oven, depending on their thickness. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>* As it turns out, in NYC at least, drug stores such as Duane Reade and Rite Aid are a great\u2013and cheap!\u2013place to find these.
