Brightening the flavor with vinegar and a good helping of salt and pepper keep this from bland-dom (a critique of many pesto potato salads), and the green beans provide the perfect antidote to those carb-phobic types.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 10", "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds small Yukon gold or red-skinned potatoes, quartered", "1 pound green beans, cut into one-inch segments", "1 to 2 small garlic cloves, peeled", "2 bunches of basil (about one ounce each)", "1/4 to 1/2 cup olive oil", "6 tablespoons (or more to taste) mild vinegar, such as champagne, white wine or a white balsamic", "1/4 cup chopped green onions (scallions)", "1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted", "Parmesan cheese to taste", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>4 pounds small Yukon gold or red-skinned potatoes, quartered<br/>\n1 pound green beans, cut into one-inch segments<br/>\n1 to 2 small garlic cloves, peeled<br/>\n2 bunches of basil (about one ounce each)<br/>\n1/4 to 1/2 cup olive oil<br/>\n6 tablespoons (or more to taste) mild vinegar, such as champagne, white wine or a white balsamic<br/>\n1/4 cup chopped green onions (scallions)<br/>\n1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted<br/>\nParmesan cheese to taste<br/>\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 10 minutes.
