I made mine with 5 both times, but think 6 would be even nicer, so there\u2019s less heavy filling between each, and have recommended this below. While you can use a fitted 8-inch cake pan if you have one, I have found that whatever bits of filling and/or cheese spill into the margins of a 9-inch cake pan are the most delicious parts \u2014 don\u2019t you dare leave them in there. A 5- or 6-high stack will go over the top of a standard cake pan, but if you\u2019re nervous about spillover (a non-issue in a 9-inch pan), you can always bake it on a foil-lined tray. Finally, should you wish to lightly fry your tortillas to a light crisp before you layer them, I\u2019d expect them to get less soft when baked. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 10 as an appetizer or light meal with a salad, 6 to 8 for dinner", "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 tablespoon olive, vegetable, or canola oil", "1 medium onion, chopped small", "1 clove garlic, minced", "1 fresh chile pepper, chopped small (optional)", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 1/2  teaspoons chili powder (adjusted to taste)", "1 can (14 ounces) or 1 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes, drained, with 1/3 cup juice reserved", "1/4 cup tomato paste", "2 cans (15.5 ounces each) black, red or kidney beans (or a mixture of any two), drained and rinsed", "Kosher or coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 cups corn kernels, fresh (from 1 to 2 ears), from 1 15-ounce can, drained, or frozen and thawed", "3 cups (about 2 3/4 ounces) rough-chopped spinach leaves", "6 medium-size (8-inch) flour tortillas (although corn should work too)", "2 cups (8 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese (I used a mix)", "Chopped fresh cilantro, sour cream and/or salsa for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Nonstick cooking spray<br/>\n1 tablespoon olive, vegetable, or canola oil<br/>\n1 medium onion, chopped small<br/>\n1 clove garlic, minced<br/>\n1 fresh chile pepper, chopped small (optional)<br/>\n1 teaspoon ground cumin<br/>\n1 1/2  teaspoons chili powder (adjusted to taste)<br/>\n1 can (14 ounces) or 1 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes, drained, with 1/3 cup juice reserved<br/>\n1/4 cup tomato paste<br/>\n2 cans (15.5 ounces each) black, red or kidney beans (or a mixture of any two), drained and rinsed<br/>\nKosher or coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1 1/2 cups corn kernels, fresh (from 1 to 2 ears), from 1 15-ounce can, drained, or frozen and thawed<br/>\n3 cups (about 2 3/4 ounces) rough-chopped spinach leaves<br/>\n6 medium-size (8-inch) flour tortillas (although corn should work too)<br/>\n2 cups (8 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese (I used a mix)<br/>\nChopped fresh cilantro, sour cream and/or salsa for serving (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat the oven to 400\u00b0F.
