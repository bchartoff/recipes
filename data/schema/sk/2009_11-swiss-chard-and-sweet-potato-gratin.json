I like to chop, wash and dry mine the day before, but if you\u2019re especially in a rush, I see no reason you can\u2019t swap pre-washed (3 pounds) or even frozen spinach (about 5 to 6 cups). I also don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t swap the sweet potato for thin slices of butternut squash but then you will have less of an exuse to say \u201cyam-yam\u201d to the baby over and over again until he laughs.</p><p>Finally, if my gratin looks a little \u201cwet\u201d to you, don\u2019t worry, yours \u2014 providing you squeeze your greens out well \u2014 should not.

Gratins reheat well, but they take almost as much time to gently heat through as they do to bake in the first place, especially deep ones like this. As for reheating, already baked and frozen, I will find out very soon! But I am near-positive it will be fine.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/11-swiss-chard-and-sweet-potato-gratin"}
