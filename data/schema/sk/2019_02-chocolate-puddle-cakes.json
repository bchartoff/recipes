Simply spoon in half the batter, add your filling in centered dollop, spoon the remaining batter on top. The sugar is a bit variable here. With a solidly bittersweet chocolate bar (70 to 72%), I like 1 tablespoon sugar, although 2 tablespoons is closer to the standard amount. With less bittersweet/more semisweet chocolate (60%), I often skip it. If you\u2019re using salted butter, you can skip the additional salt, or just add a pinch of flakes for crunch. I bake these in two 6-ounce ramekins (I\u2019ve had these forever, but there are many more options out there) but I bet two to three cups of a standard muffin/cupcake pan would work as well, or you could merge it all into a 10-ounce or about 5 inches across.", "totalTime": "P0DT0H15M0S", "recipeYield": "2", "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons (55 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks, plus more for dishes", "2 teaspoons cocoa powder, plus more for dusting", "3 ounces (85 grams) bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt or a couple pinches of flaky salt", "1 to 2 tablespoons (13 to 25 grams) granulated sugar (see Note)", "1 large egg", "1 egg yolk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees F.
