By the time the heatwave hit, I\u2019d already had all the cakes baked, THANK GOD.) Wrapped well, you can freeze cakes for up to a month and nobody would ever know upon tasting the final product.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Second, I finally started using cake boards, or those cardboard rounds about 1-inch wider in diameter than the cake. Bakeries use them for a reason: they protect the sides of the cake when it is boxed up. They also make it very easy to transfer the cake from box to plate. You can line them with a shiny foil paper or a doily. Having tried both, I think I prefer the former.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Third, I\u2019m finally slipping some scraps of waxed paper under the cake, protecting the board from my decorating messes.

I simply bought three boxes from a local bakery (they give them to us for about $2 each, the smartest money we spend.) Hearkening back to my bakery days, I tied them with bakery string, the honest-to-god easiest way to carry a boxed cake, while keeping it balanced. In a pinch, you can even stack the boxes (rotating each one slightly, so their sides cross the corners of the box below), though I don\u2019t recommend this for any extended period of time.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/06-pistachio-petit-four-cake"}
