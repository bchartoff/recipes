I really tried to avoid this pesky oven step by toasting mine in a skillet, the one I\u2019d use to fry the capers in a few minutes. Twice, I failed because the little bits got black and smoky before the larger ones toasted, no matter how much I kept them moving. I\u2019m pretty sure I could do better in the future, but I was running out of almonds. If you trust your pan-toasting skills, feel free to cook the almonds there instead.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/09-cauliflower-slaw"}
