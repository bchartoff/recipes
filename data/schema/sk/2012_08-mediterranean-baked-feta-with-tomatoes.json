Feta is so salty and tomatoes are so delicious and sweet right now, the more the merrier. Now, I don\u2019t have a grill but I am sharing the grilling instructions here because most of you do, but with the caveat that I haven\u2019t tested this on a grill. My only concern would be leakage. I don\u2019t think any harm would come from doubling up on the foil.</p><p>If you\u2019d like to make this with haloumi (you can buy it here or here or here, btw, and probably a cheese or good grocery store closer to you), I like to cut my block of haloumi into about 1/3- to 1/2-inch slices. I brush the grill with oil and place it gently, directly on the grates, cooking it until it\u2019s blistered on one side, then flipping it and doing the other. Lay the grilled slices out on a plate and toss it with a chopped salad made from the non-feta ingredients below, plus a splash of red wine vinegar. I usually skip the garlic (just personal taste) and would only use a tablespoon or so of minced red onion, since the salad will be raw, but otherwise think you\u2019ll love it as much as we do.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved", "1/3 cup chopped, pitted Kalmata olives", "1 clove garlic, minced", "1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion (oops, I forgot this)", "2 tablespoons finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, divided", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon olive oil", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 8- to 10-ounce block feta", "Crackers, flatbread*, pita chips, or crostini, for dipping "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved<br/>\n1/3 cup chopped, pitted Kalmata olives<br/>\n1 clove garlic, minced<br/>\n1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion (oops, I forgot this)<br/>\n2 tablespoons finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, divided<br/>\n1 teaspoon dried oregano<br/>\n1 teaspoon olive oil<br/>\nFreshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1 8- to 10-ounce block feta<br/>\nCrackers, flatbread*, pita chips, or crostini, for dipping </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a bowl, mix the tomatoes, olives, onion, garlic, 1 tablespoon of the parsley, oregano, olive oil and a few grinds of pepper. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>On a grill: Heat your grill to medium-high.
