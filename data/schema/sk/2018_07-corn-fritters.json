We got 12 to 16 fritters from it, just enough for our family with a few leftovers.

Use a sharp knife to cut the kernels from the corn into the bowl, then run the back of your knife up and down the stalk to release as much \u201cmilk\u201d as possible into the bowl. Repeat with remaining ears. It\u2019s okay if you get a little more or a little less than 3 cups of corn. "}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add scallions, herbs, cheese, and many grinds of black pepper and stir to evenly combine. Taste for seasoning; I usually find I needed more salt and pepper. Add the eggs and use a fork or spoon to stir until they\u2019re all broken up and evenly coat the corn mixture. Add 1 cup of flour and stir to throughly coat. My mixture at this point (especially with bi-color corn) looked precisely like egg salad, to give you an idea of what you\u2019re looking for: mostly kernels and just a little visible batter to bind it. A scoop of it should hold its shape unless pressed down; if yours does not, add the remaining flour. (For reference, I needed it.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Once hot and shimmering, add your first scoop of corn fritter batter and press it gently to flatten it. (I used a #40 scoop, which holds a little less than 2 tablespoons. Tinier fritters are easier to manage.) Corn fritters cook quickly so keep an eye on them. When the underside is a deep golden brown, flip and cook to the same color on the second side. Drain on a paper towel, sprinkling on more salt. When it\u2019s cool enough to try, taste and adjust the seasonings of the remaining batter if needed.
