Pat the leaves dry with towels. Roll about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of filling in each leaf (depending on the size of your leaf) and arrange in a large, wide pot. Pour in enough juice or sauce to cover the rolls. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat, letting them simmer covered on the stove on low for about 45 minutes. Serve immediately. If sauce has thinned a bit, you can heat up any additional sauce you didn\u2019t use and pour it over as you serve the rolls.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>[These also freeze very well.]</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/02-alexs-moms-stuffed-cabbage"}
