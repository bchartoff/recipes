I am still loyal to all-butter crusts, but I\u2019ve come around to mixing your dough with your fingers (with a satisfying squash of each cube, although I\u2019m never giving up my pastry blender), I\u2019ve added a little folding to the rolling-out steps, which improves structure and increases the expansion of flaky layer, and that with this, you can get away with leaving the butter in larger, lima bean-sized pieces. Finally, I actually get the dough pretty damp \u2014 you\u2019ll be sure it\u2019s too soft and sticky, but I promise, it\u2019s not \u2014 and it\u2019s not a problem at all. In fact, because we\u2019re using a higher proportion of butter in this dough, and butter is very hard when it\u2019s cold, I find that this extra moisture makes what would otherwise be a very firm dough easier to roll.", "totalTime": "15 minutes prep, 1 to 2 hours to chill", "recipeYield": "For one standard double-crust pie, two single-crust pies, or this lattice-slab shown here", "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon (15 grams) granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1 cup (230 grams, 8 ounces, or 16 tablespoons) cold, unsalted butter", "1/2 cup (120 grams) very cold water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place your flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.

Mix 4 cups sliced rhubarb (here about 1/4-inch thick), 3 tablespoons tapioca starch, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, a pinch of salt, a pinch of ginger, and the juice of half a lemon. Roll both pie dough halves into 10\u00d715-inch rectangles; keep them firm and cool in the fridge while not using them, especially if they\u2019ve gotten soft or your kitchen is hot. Place first half on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spoon filling on, leaving a 1.5-inch border. Cut second dough into on the diagonal into strips, whatever width you\u2019d like. Lay every other strip over rhubarb filling in one angled direction. Form a lattice with remaining strips in the opposite direction. Trim strips so that they\u2019re flush with bottom crust area. Fold crust over the lattice top and filling all around the pie, crimping to tighten the seal. Brush with an egg wash (1 egg, beaten lightly with 1 teaspoon water) and sprinkle with coarse or raw sugar. Bake for about 25 minutes, until golden all over. Let cool to warm before cutting into squares."}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/03-extra-flaky-pie-crust"}
