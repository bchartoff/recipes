DON\u2019T DO THIS. Not because they crush each other (they won\u2019t) or because they\u2019ll stick (they don\u2019t) but because that paper liner is greased on both sides from baking and the chocolate shell never quite stuck right to the pink cake because of the grease accidentally left on it. I can\u2019t tell you how many cookies were rejected because their chocolate fell off. It is too sad to discuss.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2. <i>Be careful dividing your jam:</i> I mindlessly divided the jam wrong/unevenly and ended up with too much between one layer and too little between another. Too little was no biggie, but where there was too much it oozed out and was particularly difficult to keep stacked when sawing through with a serrated knife. So, if you\u2019re using a scale to make two six-ounce divisions of jam, remember that you\u2019ve probably strained out a good ounce or so of jam solids, or in other words DUH. Your divided amounts will be less than six ounces each.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>3. <i>They\u2019re easier to cut when frozen:</i> Nevertheless, they tasted amazingly and I was all ready to do a victory lap around my wee kitchen counter, however, when I got to cutting them up and then it all went south. People, these were <i>trying</i> to cut. The problem lies within the differing textures of the layers \u2014 the top hard chocolate shell more benefits from a sharp serrated knife (a regular, even very sharp knife will crack the edges when you press down on it), the same serrated knife that gets gummed with jam and tries to pull the soft cake layers in between apart. It was exasperating. It didn\u2019t go well. I packed up some for a party and stuffed the rest in the freezer, only to discover the next day that these cut <i>fantastically</i> when frozen. Seriously. Trust me. I have the gummy floor and gray hairs to prove it.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/12-seven-layer-cookies"}
