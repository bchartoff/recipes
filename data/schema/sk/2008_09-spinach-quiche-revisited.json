You can par bake this if you wish, though I generally do not. The original recipe calls for a sheet of puff pastry as the shell. It is not my preference to do it this way, but I am sure others would like it.</p><p>Update 5/30/13 to add: I made this yesterday with 1.5 pounds regular spinach. After removing the heavier stems, washing and wilting it down in a pan, but before pressing out all the water, this worked out to 10 ounces of spinach. So, I\u2019d say if you were interested in starting with fresh grown-up (i.e. not the baby spinach that you wouldn\u2019t bother removing the stems for) spinach, start with the same amount. It\u2019s even more delicious this way, especially with the sauteed leeks I used as well.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 3-ounce package cream cheese, room temperature", "1/3 cup half and half (or milk)", "3 eggs", "1 10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained", "1/2 cup grated cheddar (gruyere works well, too)", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan", "4 to 6 green onions, thinly sliced (1/2 cup finely diced red or white onion or shallots work as well)", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 3-ounce package cream cheese, room temperature<br/>\n1/3 cup half and half (or milk)<br/>\n3 eggs<br/>\n1 10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained<br/>\n1/2 cup grated cheddar (gruyere works well, too)<br/>\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan<br/>\n4 to 6 green onions, thinly sliced (1/2 cup finely diced red or white onion or shallots work as well)<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon salt<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon pepper</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 425\u00b0.
