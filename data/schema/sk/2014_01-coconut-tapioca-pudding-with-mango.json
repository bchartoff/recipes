Remove from heat and add vanilla extract, if using.

Place 1 can of full-fat coconut milk in the fridge overnight; in most brands, this will cause the coconut fats and thin milk/watery part to separate. Place a small/medium mixing bowl in the freezer, ideally metal. The next day, turn it upside-down before opening it, so that the thickened coconut fat will be at the bottom. Pour off the thin coconut milk; you should have about 1 cup and this can be used towards the 2 1/2 cups needed for your pudding. About 2/3 cup thickened coconut fat will remain at the bottom of the can; scrape this into your chilled bowl, add about 1 tablespoon granulated sugar (for a light sweetness; use more to taste) and beat it with an electric mixer until thick and whipped cream-like. Dollop it over desserts such as this, though you\u2019ll have more than you need for 6 puddings. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>To toast coconut chips:</i> Heat an oven to 350 degrees F. Spread coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes, tossing once if needed to help them brown evenly.

With a sharp paring knife, split the segment lengthwise. Use the back of the knife to scrape the seeds out of the open pod; they\u2019ll be on both sides and look a bit like sticky tar. Use these in your pudding. Go ahead and throw the pods in, too, for extra flavor, just remember to fish them out before chilling the pudding.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/01-coconut-tapioca-pudding-with-mango"}
