It originally called for 1 cup of self-rising flour; since it\u2019s rare we use that on SK, the flour, baking powder, and half the salt replace what that 1 cup would contain. What remains is that this is a great formula for a simple dinner pancake, even if you swap in different ingredients with quick cooking times.", "totalTime": "P0DT0H15M0S", "recipeYield": "2 to 4", "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons (20 grams or 3/4 ounce) unsalted butter", "1/3 cup (2 1/2 fluid ounces) milk, any kind", "1/2 cup ricotta cheese", "2 large eggs", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup torn basil leaves (I use roughly chopped baby spinach here instead)", "About 3 ounces (85 grams) cured ham, torn or cut into strips", "1/2 a smallish zucchini (about 3 ounces), cut into matchsticks", "Vegetable or olive oil, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in the bottom of a large bowl in the microwave.
