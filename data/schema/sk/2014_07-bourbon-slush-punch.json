The resulting punch is lightly sweet and very refreshing. And it crunches. You can definitely double it for a crowd. If you would rather make the slush the way originally recommended, after you make the punch base mixture, add 2 cups cold water to it. Pour mixture into a gallon-sized freezer bag. Freeze mixture until slushy (this might take several to many hours), and serve. If it freezes solid, place it in a punch bowl and let it thaw, breaking it up every 15 minutes or so. Blending ice cubes as directed below is definitely less work.", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup water", "2 tea bags (whatever you like for iced tea)", "1 cup bourbon", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "1 1/2 cups orange juice (about 3 well-squeezed oranges)", "6 tablespoons lemon juice (about 2 lemons)", "16 to 17 ounces (about 5 cups of small pieces of ice) ice cubes", "Mint sprigs or lemon slices, for garnish "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup water<br/>\n2 tea bags (whatever you like for iced tea)<br/>\n1 cup bourbon<br/>\n1/4 cup granulated sugar<br/>\n1 1/2 cups orange juice (about 3 well-squeezed oranges)<br/>\n6 tablespoons lemon juice (about 2 lemons)<br/>\n16 to 17 ounces (about 5 cups of small pieces of ice) ice cubes<br/>\nMint sprigs or lemon slices, for garnish </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Boil 1 cup water for tea.
