First, it\u2019s created for what I consider an unusual tart pan size (11 1/4 by 8-inch), which I have, but that doesn\u2019t help most other people. You could also make it in a 10-inch round but I liked the idea of turning these into bars, since they\u2019re so much more picnic-and-potluck friendly. Below, I\u2019m sharing a scaled-down recipe for an 8\u00d78-inch pan (or a 9-inch round pan, if you want to serve it in wedges) and (update: added at the end!) a scaled-up recipe for 9\u00d713-inch slab tart bars. Making tart-height walls (1-inch) in a taller cake pan is a little fussy, but totally doable, and this recipe is forgiving. There\u2019s a general belief that if you don\u2019t parbake a bottom crust, it will be soggy, but all three of mine are crisp underneath \u2014 and even more so when the tart cools before I cut it, thanks to the unheavy and unsoggy filling.
