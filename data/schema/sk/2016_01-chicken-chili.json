I estimate two small corn tortillas per person and cut them into 8 wedges. Brush a large baking sheet lightly with olive oil, arrange tortilla wedges in one layer, lightly dab the tops with more olive oil and sprinkle with fine salt. Bake at 350 for 10 minutes, check for color, and add more baking time as needed until they\u2019re golden and crisp."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Troubleshooting: It sounds like a some people are having trouble getting their dried beans to cook in the suggested times. I\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. I tested this with different beans (Rancho Gordo and also Goya brand) and in different slow-cookers (an ancient one from Farberware and another from Proctor-Silex) and never had trouble; I\u2019m beginning to suspect my slow-cooker is more robust than others in heat. This is little consolation to those of you with crunchy beans. "}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "So, to troubleshoot: If you\u2019re worried or have had trouble in the past getting dried beans to cook in a reasonable amount of time in your slow-cooker, go ahead and soak them overnight first. But, I want you to soak them in the 5 1/3 cups of water and then use that water \u2014 which is now full of flavor \u2014 in the slow-cooker. This will also allow you to have the right liquid level at the end, since it will be impossible otherwise to know how much water your beans absorbed and adjust the recipe accordingly. "}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "A note about kidney beans: I do not use kidney beans here, but small red ones, and I do not presoak my beans however if you are using red kidney beans, do keep in mind that due to a protein known as phytohaemagglutinin the FDA advises people who wish to use kidney beans in slow-cookers to first soak the beans for at least 5 hours, dump the water, boil them in fresh water for 10 minutes and then continue with the recipe. As your beans will have soaked up more liquid before they go in, you will find you need less to cook them in for the final chili. In terms of how freaked out you should be over kidney beans, from the FDA website: \u201cReports of this syndrome in the United States are anecdotal and have not been formally published.\u201d And that this was mostly a concern reported in the last 70s in the UK.
