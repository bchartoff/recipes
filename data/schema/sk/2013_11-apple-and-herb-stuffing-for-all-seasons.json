Although they use the same recipes, stuffing goes inside the bird, dressing is baked outside, and I insist that it is better outside the bird. When making stuffing to, uh, stuff, uh, places, one must cook the bird to a higher-than-normal temperature to ensure that the stuffing inside is free from undercooked poultry drippings. Seeing as most turkey is dry enough, I see no point in helping it along. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Variations:</u></p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2013/11-apple-and-herb-stuffing-for-all-seasons"}
