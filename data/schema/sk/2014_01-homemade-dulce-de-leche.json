One of the best parts about making it from scratch is that you can control the sweetness a bit; 1 cup is the standard sugar recommendation per quart of milk, but I\u2019ve also seen and am curious to try it with 3/4 cup. Baking soda is not mandatory here, but it\u2019s supposed to help the final caramel not have any lumps, as well as enhancing the brown color. (Thanks, Maillard!) Some versions contain vanilla, others contain cinnamon (you can leave it in for all or part of the time, if you\u2019re worried it\u2019s getting too cinnamon-y), some contain both \u2014 really only add them if that\u2019s the flavor you\u2019re hoping for.

Use immediately, or cool completely, storing in the fridge for up to one month with an airtight lid. Rewarm as needed to soften the caramel; a microwave is efficient but you can also warm the jar in a 1- to 2-inch puddle (shorter than the jar lid, of course) of simmering water in a saucepan until it re-liquefies. If mixture seems too thick to pour even after fully reheating, you can stir in a little water, 1 teaspoon at a time.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Serve it: Over everything.
