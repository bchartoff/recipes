I used red beans I\u2019d soaked and cooked this weekend, but you could use canned as well, to save time. (Goya are my absolute favorite for reliably intact and un-mushy beans from a can.) Minus the sour cream or any added cheese, this dish is vegan as well as vegetarian.

Yes, unfortunate, as it comes on or in almost every cuisine I adore. I don\u2019t know what came over me this week, but I went to the store with a plan to replace the cilantro with parsley, as I often do, and bought the evil greens instead. And cooked with them. And ate them. Maybe it\u2019s the blending with peppers, onions and broth that mellowed it. Maybe, for once, these food cravings could be for good, and not just butter. Either way: hooray! </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/03-red-bean-and-green-grain-taco-bowl"}
