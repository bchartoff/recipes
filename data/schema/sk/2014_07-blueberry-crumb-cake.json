First, while most cakes of this size use a quarter pound of butter, plus an additional quarter or eighth for the crumb, this uses half and you don\u2019t notice any missing. There\u2019s as much butter in the cake as there is in the streusel, which I see as a sign that Heatter had her priorities straight. Second, every time I make the streusel topping, I find it too buttery and soft; I\u2019m eager to add more flour to make it more crumbly but I recommend resisting because Heatter knows what she\u2019s doing. The streusel will seem moist but when it bakes, it will both become crumb-like and adhere well to the cake, so you lose very little when you flip the cake out of the pan. I should know not to doubt her, anyway.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 in big wedges or 16 in the 2\u00d72-ish-inch grid I cut mine roughly into", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Topping:</u>", "5 tablespoons (40 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "4 tablespoons (1/4 cup, 2 ounces or 55 grams) unsalted butter, cold is fine", "Pinch of salt", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Cake:</u>", "2 cups minus 1 tablespoon (i.e. 1 3/4 cups + 3 tablespoons or 240 grams) all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon table salt", "4 tablespoons (1/4 cup, 2 ounces or 55 grams) unsalted butter, softened", "3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar", "Zest of 1 lemon", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 pint (2 to 2 2/3 cups, 12 to 16 ounces, or 340 to 455 grams; see Note) fresh blueberries, clean and dry", "1/2 cup milk, whole is ideal, any kind should work", "1/2 cup (55 grams) walnuts, chopped medium fine (optional)", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Cake:</u><br/>\n2 cups minus 1 tablespoon (i.e. 1 3/4 cups + 3 tablespoons or 240 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n2 teaspoons baking powder<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon table salt<br/>\n4 tablespoons (1/4 cup, 2 ounces or 55 grams) unsalted butter, softened<br/>\n3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\nZest of 1 lemon<br/>\n1 large egg<br/>\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>\n1 pint (2 to 2 2/3 cups, 12 to 16 ounces, or 340 to 455 grams; see Note) fresh blueberries, clean and dry<br/>\n1/2 cup milk, whole is ideal, any kind should work<br/>\n1/2 cup (55 grams) walnuts, chopped medium fine (optional)<br/>\nConfectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 375\u00b0F.
