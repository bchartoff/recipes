The first time I made these cookies (in 2008), mine flattened out a lot; it was not a good look, while for others, these were the puffed, crackly things you see in the current pictures (updated March 2018). In hindsight, I think I used too few walnuts, or got a little yolk mixed up in my egg whites. I\u2019ve also found one more trick for extra height: if you scoop your cookies out on your tray and wait 30 minutes (up to an hour, if you have it, but 30 is fine) to bake them, they dome better. This is a technique used when making macarons, and I was delighted to find it works well here too. If you bake them right away, this too is fine, they just come out a little more flat (see here).", "totalTime": "2hr 30mins", "recipeYield": "20 to 24", "recipeIngredient": ["2 3/4 cups (285 grams or 10 ounces) walnut halves", "3 cups (360 grams) confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons (55 grams) unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 large egg whites, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon (15 ml) pure vanilla extract", "A few sea salt flakes to finish (if you wish)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
