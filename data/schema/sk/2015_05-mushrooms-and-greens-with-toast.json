But I\u2019d otherwise consider this a one-pan meal. No, a one-pan miracle. For mushrooms, O\u2019Brady suggests chanterelles, shiitake and oyster mushrooms and I admit I got carried away, buying a few fancy ones (a trumpet mushroom too!) along with creminis, but you could make this entirely with small white or brown mushroom and it would still be delicious. For the greens, kale, chard, spinach or nettles are suggested; I use lancinato kale leaves. And for a cheese, it really doesn\u2019t matter what you use, only that you like it and it likes to melt. Ch\u00e8vre, mozzarella, burrata, taleggio and fontina are all \u201cfair game,\u201d she writes. I went with a soft, melty fontina and it was perfect here. I used the bread I\u2019m most obsessed with, massive whole wheat sourdough loaves that you can buy in quarters at Balthazar\u2019s bakery on Spring Street or in Englewood, NJ or at any outlet of the Le Pain Quotidien chain, but of course any bread you enjoy eating will work well here too.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and torn into bite size pieces (see suggestions above)", "2 thick slices bread from a large, crusty loaf (I\u2019d use 4 from a smaller loaf)", "2 cloves garlic or 1 shallot, minced", "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar, or more to taste (I used 2)", "1 fresh red chile, stemmed, seeded and minced or red pepper flakes, to taste", "Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper", "6 ounces chopped fresh greens (see suggestions above)", "8 ounces of a good melting cheese, thickly sliced (suggestions above)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided<br/>\n1 tablespoon olive oil<br/>\n1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and torn into bite size pieces (see suggestions above)<br/>\n2 thick slices bread from a large, crusty loaf (I\u2019d use 4 from a smaller loaf)<br/>\n2 cloves garlic or 1 shallot, minced<br/>\n1 tablespoon white wine vinegar, or more to taste (I used 2)<br/>\n1 fresh red chile, stemmed, seeded and minced or red pepper flakes, to taste<br/>\nCoarse salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n6 ounces chopped fresh greens (see suggestions above)<br/>\n8 ounces of a good melting cheese, thickly sliced (suggestions above)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter and olive oil together in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.

If you\u2019re me, you\u2019ll add 1 more tablespoon vinegar for brightness at this point. Stir in remaining tablespoon butter and adjust seasonings to taste. Rip bread into irregular croutons and push them into the sauteed vegetables. Lay pieces of cheese atop everything.
