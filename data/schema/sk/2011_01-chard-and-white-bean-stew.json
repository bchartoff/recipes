I have yet to get over my dislike of kale, despite a brief period of acceptance when I learned how to make it into chips. I used chard instead, but you could use any green you\u2019ve got, even spinach. (Though if you are unfamiliar with chard but like spinach, trust me, you\u2019ll love chard.) I also only used 2/3 of the greens suggested, because I really want this to be a white bean, not greens, stew. Then, I swapped some of the vegetable broth for pureed tomatoes, because that\u2019s what I think a bean stew needs. I dialed back the broth a bit, because I don\u2019t like soupy stews\u2026 Oh, and I added some weights and then (typical!) forgot I was weighing ingredients so only some are listed. Sorry about that.</p><p>Finally, I cooked the wine down more than suggested because I wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t accidentally going to booze up the kid so that he might accidentally get a good night\u2019s sleep.
