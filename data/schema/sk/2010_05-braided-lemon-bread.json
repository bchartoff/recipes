With the side of your hand, lightly press two lines down the dough lengthwise, dividing it into three equal columns. Spread the cream cheese filling down the center section, leaving the top and bottom two inches free of filling. (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/4603100668/\">Like so</a>.)

Remove the four corner segments.

Lift the top dough strip and gently bring it diagonally across the filling.

When you\u2019re ready to work with it again, you bring it back to room temperature and let it resume rising from where it left off. This can take a few hours since it is cold. For this braid, my favorite way to approach it is to assemble the whole thing, braided and filled, put it on its baking sheet, loosely cover it with plastic and either refrigerate it overnight or up to a day, or freeze it for up to a week (wrapped better once frozen, of course). When you\u2019re ready to use it, take it out, bring it back to room temperature and let it complete its second rise before you brush and bake it.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><b>* Pearl Sugar:</b> If you like to bake, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LDAE4C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=smitten-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001LDAE4C\">pearl sugar</a> is great stuff to have around.
