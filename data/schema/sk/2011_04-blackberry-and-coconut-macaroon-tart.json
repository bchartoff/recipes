If you\u2019re trying it with matzo meal, it might be worth it to grind everything together in a food processor and if you need an extra tablespoon of melted butter to pull it together, go for it.</p><p>Some long-winded notes about volumes: The original recipe called for an 8\u00d711-inch tart pan, which I did not have, or the equivalent of in volume. I ended using 2/3 of the crust recipe and 3/4 of the filling (2/3, which would have been correct, seemed like too much of a headache with 4 egg whites) to fill a 13.75\u00d74.25-inch tart pan I have (but never use, because no standard recipes work in it!). Instead of suggesting pan sizes you probably don\u2019t have, I\u2019ve done what I should have from the get-go and scaled the whole recipe to 3/4 of the original volume which should nicely fit in a 9-inch round tart pan (with removable bottom) or an 8-inch square cake pan with the understanding that the first bar will probably not come out cleanly! Unless you have an 8-inch square cake pan with a springform or removable bottom, in which case, I\u2019m jealous of how well supplied your kitchen is!</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Crust</u>", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white whole wheat flour, spelt flour or matzo cake meal", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened finely shredded coconut", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon natural cane sugar (I used a coarse Turbinado because I had it on hand)", "Generous 1/4 teaspoon fine grain sea salt", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "1 1/2 cups unsweetened finely shredded coconut", "6 tablespoons natural cane sugar or lightly packed light brown sugar", "3 large egg whites", "6 ounces fresh blackberries, halved (feel free to swap any berry/cherry you can find in season)", "1/4 cup pistachios, crushed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling</u><br/>\n1 1/2 cups unsweetened finely shredded coconut<br/>\n6 tablespoons natural cane sugar or lightly packed light brown sugar<br/>\n3 large egg whites<br/>\n6 ounces fresh blackberries, halved (feel free to swap any berry/cherry you can find in season)<br/>\n1/4 cup pistachios, crushed</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make base:</u> Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F with a rack in the middle of the oven.
