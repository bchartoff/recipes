First, you could make them triple coconut muffins (and dairy free) by using coconut milk instead of yogurt, but I do like the texture that the tangy yogurt imparts and these muffins have no lack of coconut flavor. You could make mango-coconut muffins by adding a cup or so of diced mango chunks to the batter; pina colada muffins would use the same volume of pineapple chunks. You could replace the yogurt with mashed banana or banana puree to make a banana-coconut muffin and if you\u2019re into that whole lime-in-the-coconut thing, you could add a teaspoon of lime zest.
