To frost the cake, place one layer, flat side up, on a cake stand or large serving plate. Spread 2/3 cup cup of the Peanut Butter Frosting evenly over the top. Repeat with the next layer. Place the last layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. (Deb note 1: Making a crumb coat of frosting\u2013a thin layer that binds the dark crumbs to the cake so they don\u2019t show up in the final outer frosting layer\u2013is a great idea for this cake, or any with a dark cake and lighter-colored frosting. Once you \u201cmask\u201d your cake, let it chill for 15 to 30 minutes until firm, then use the remainder of the frosting to create a smooth final coating. Deb note 2: Once the cake is fully frosted, it helps to chill it again and let it firm up. The cooler and more set the peanut butter frosting is, the better drip effect you\u2019ll get from the Chocolate-Peanut Butter Glaze.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>5. To decorate with the Chocolate\u2013Peanut Butter Glaze, put the cake plate on a large baking sheet to catch any drips. Simply pour the glaze over the top of the cake, and using an offset spatula, spread it evenly over the top just to the edges so that it runs down the sides of the cake in long drips. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes to allow the glaze and frosting to set completely. Remove about 1 hour before serving. Decorate the top with chopped peanut brittle.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><b>Peanut Butter Frosting</b><br/>\nMakes about 5 cups</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>10 ounces (285 grams) cream cheese, at room temperature<br/>\n1 stick (115 grams, 4 ounces or 1/2 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br/>\n5 cups (600 grams) confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted<br/>\n2/3 cup (170 grams) smooth peanut butter, preferably a commercial brand (because oil doesn\u2019t separate out)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1.
