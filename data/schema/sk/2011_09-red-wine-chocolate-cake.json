It will taste like there\u2019s wine in there though not in the way that it would leave you tipsy, nevertheless, I will not be using this cake for, say, my toddler\u2019s birthday party, if you get my drift. If you\u2019re familiar with the Everyday Chocolate Cake, you might notice that I\u2019ve changed a bunch of things. It\u2019s flat and round, not a thick loaf. I use only 3/4 of the volume of some ingredients and 2/3 volume of others, you\u2019ll see, the red wine gives it an intensity that\u2019s best served thin \u2014 the final cake is only 3/4- to 1-inch tall, and bakes quickly. I add a yolk which just\u2026 makes it better and cinnamon, which plays off the red wine and chocolate fantastically, but not so much that it competes with either.

Line the bottom of a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment, and either butter and lightly flour the parchment and exposed sides of the pan, or spray the interior with a nonstick spray. In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter until smooth. Add the sugars and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and yolk and beat well, then the red wine and vanilla. Don\u2019t worry if the batter looks a little uneven. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together, right over your wet ingredients. Mix until 3/4 combined, then fold the rest together with a rubber spatula. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. The top of the cake should be shiny and smooth, like a puddle of chocolate. Cool in pan on a rack for about 10 minutes, then flip out of pan and cool the rest of the way on a cooling rack. This cake keeps well at room temperature or in the fridge. It looks pretty dusted with powdered sugar.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Make the topping:</i> Whip mascarpone, cream, sugar and vanilla together until soft peaks form \u2014 don\u2019t overwhip.
