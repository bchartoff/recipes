I run into this a lot in the CI universe; I have great respect for what they do, this attempt at perfect recipes, but they often leave me questioning if it is worth all that. Fortunately, this is. That said, I found a place or two where the recipe could be streamlined, and if you have an immersion blender, this is a great time to use it and save yourself energy. Finally, the recipe suggests you preheat your oven before you begin. For me, this led to an oven running at 400 degrees for an hour \u2014 silly. But some ovens take longer than others to preheat; if yours is one of them, turn it on when the recipe suggests. If not, find a time 20 minutes or so before you need to bake it.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 6, generously", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup cornmeal", "2 3/4 cups whole milk", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus additional for greasing dish", "2 cups corn kernels (from 3 to 4 ears of corn, or frozen, if defrosted and well drained)", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne", "3 large eggs, separated", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup cornmeal<br/>\n2 3/4 cups whole milk<br/>\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus additional for greasing dish<br/>\n2 cups corn kernels (from 3 to 4 ears of corn, or frozen, if defrosted and well drained)<br/>\n1 teaspoon sugar<br/>\n1 teaspoon salt<br/>\n1/8 teaspoon cayenne<br/>\n3 large eggs, separated<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (see Note above if this seems too early). <i>Very</i> generously grease a 1 1/2 quart souffl\u00e9 dish or an 8-inch square baking dish.
