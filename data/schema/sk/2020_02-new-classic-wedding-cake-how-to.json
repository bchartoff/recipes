A coupler allows you to switch decorating tips without having to change the bag.\n\u2013 Put a small amount of frosting in a smallish bowl. The more colors you\u2019ll want to use, the less frosting you\u2019ll need right now. I use a couple tablespoons at a time for this small cake shown here. Arrange the colors you\u2019ll want to use in some sort of chromatic order. Tint this blob of frosting with the first one and put it in the bag.\n\u2013 Put a tiny schmear of frosting on your flower nail. Place your first square of parchment on top. Pipe a bunch of blops, bops, or swirls into something flower-ish. Carefully pull the paper off the flower nail and put it on your tray.\n\u2013 Make a few more flowers. Before the frosting in the bag runs out, add another scoop of plain frosting to the bowl and tint it with your next color. Mix it with any frosting left in the bowl from the previous color. Add it to the piping bag.\n\u2013 Continue to make flowers. Change tips whenever you\u2019re bored of the shape you\u2019ve been using or go back to an earlier one. Add colors as needed. Instead of having distinct colors in each flower, you\u2019ll have blends, ombre-ish. It\u2019s much prettier, in my opinion; a lovely reward for this lazier method.\n\u2013 When your tray is full, freeze it. If you think you\u2019ll need a second tray of flowers to cover your cake, continue until you have more than you\u2019ll think you\u2019ll need. Very soon, the flowers will be solid and will be very easy to lift from the parchment squares and arranged on the cake.\n\u2013 Tint some frosting in a leaf-y green. Place a leaf tip on your piping bag. (I\u2019d probably first squeeze out any remaining flower color, since we want the leaves to be clearly leaf-like.) Use the leaf tip to fill in the spaces between the flowers.
