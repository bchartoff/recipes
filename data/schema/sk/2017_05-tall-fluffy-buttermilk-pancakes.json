You should absolutely double it; I\u2019m only not doing it preemptively because this amount works well for us (we adults usually try to eat more fruit than pancakes, heh). I find small pancakes easier to flip and the portions seem more fitting for small kids who still want a \u201cstack.\u201d I usually make this with buttermilk but if you only have yogurt, for a thick, plain one, use 1/2 cup and thin it with 3 tablespoons of milk.

Whisk in salt and baking soda until fully combined, scrape down bowl, then stir in flour until it just disappears. You\u2019re looking for a thick mixture, more like a very soft cookie dough than a pourable batter, but if it\u2019s very stiff, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of the remaining buttermilk and stir until combined."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat griddle or frying pan over medium. Once hot, add a good pat of butter (please don\u2019t skimp; butter makes crispy edges) and dollop in small mounds of pancake batter \u2014 I find a #40 or 1.5 tablespoon scoop to make this even easier and neater. Try to resist the urge to press the mounds into flat puddles; a little nudge is okay but we\u2019d much rather keep the height here. Once bubbles form on top, lift a corner of each pancake and check for it to be lightly browned before flipping it.

You can leave them in the oven for much longer, however, if you now wish to rinse berries and make coffee (which of course you do)."}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2017/05-tall-fluffy-buttermilk-pancakes"}
