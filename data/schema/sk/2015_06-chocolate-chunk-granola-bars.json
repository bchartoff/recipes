I love the crispy crunch of uncooked millet, but you could instead use quinoa, quinoa flakes, wheat germ (although this would negate the GF status) or even just more oats to replace it. The sunflower seed butter could be replaced with tahini, or another nut butter if you needn\u2019t make these nut-free. For the dried fruit, I used tart cherries because cherries and chocolate always remind me of Cherry Garcia Ice Cream, hooray.
