Needless to say, that inspired these. What I learned from the comments is that baked goods like this \u2014 where you want the strawberries to almost melt \u2014 really work best with the more fragile berries you\u2019d pick yourself or get at a farmers market, preferably when they\u2019re almost or actually overripe. Grocery store strawberries \u2014 firmer stock, designed for long-distance shipping \u2014 will also be delicious here, but they\u2019re less likely to melt and trickle. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups (280 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon (15 grams) aluminum-free baking powder", "1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon table salt", "6 tablespoons (85 grams) cold, unsalted butter", "1 cup (about 130 grams) chopped very ripe strawberries (I quarter small or medium ones and further chop larger ones)", "1 cup heavy cream "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2 1/4 cups (280 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1 tablespoon (15 grams) aluminum-free baking powder<br/>\n1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon table salt<br/>\n6 tablespoons (85 grams) cold, unsalted butter<br/>\n1 cup (about 130 grams) chopped very ripe strawberries (I quarter small or medium ones and further chop larger ones)<br/>\n1 cup heavy cream </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Add butter, either by cutting it in with two knives or a pastry blender (alternatively, you can freeze the butter and grate it in on the large holes of a box grater; a tip I learned from you guys) cut it into the flour mixture with a pastry blender, breaking it up until the mixture resembles a crumbly meal with tiny pea-sized bits of butter about. Gently stir in the strawberries, so that they are coated in dry ingredient, then stir in heavy cream. (I like to use a rubber spatula to gently lift and turn the ingredients over each other.) When you\u2019ve mixed it in as best as you can with the spatula, go ahead and knead it once or twice in the bowl, to create one mass. Do not worry about getting the dough evenly mixed. It\u2019s far more important that the dough is not overworked.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Generously flour your counter. With as few movements as possible, transfer your dough to the counter, generously flour the top of it and with your hands or a rolling pin, gently roll or press the dough out to a 3/4-inch thickness.

However, if you wish to get a lead on them, you can make them, arrange them on your parchment-lined sheet and freeze them. If you\u2019re prepping just one day in advance, cover the tray with plastic wrap and bake them the day you need them. If you\u2019re preparing them more than one day in advance, once they are frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag or container. Bring them back to a parchment-lined sheet when you\u2019re ready to bake them. No need to defrost the froze, unbaked scones, just add 2 to 3 minutes to your baking time.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/06-strawberries-and-cream-biscuits"}
