Instead, I used ice cream. Use any flavor you wish, but if you want to go full cookies-and-cream with this cake, as I did, use the ice cream for the filling and if you can find it, swap all or half (a little goes a long way) of the cocoa powder with black cocoa powder. [We\u2019ve talked about it before here and here.] Cream of tartar, an acidic ingredient, is often added to whipped egg whites to help increase their volume. I discovered I was out (making too much play-doh again, obviously) and used 1/8 teaspoon plain vinegar instead. It worked great.", "totalTime": "1 hour plus time to re-chill ice cream", "recipeYield": "8 to 10", "recipeIngredient": ["4 large eggs, separated", "3 tablespoons (40 grams) granulated sugar", "Heaped 1/8 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "Heaped 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar (see Note)", "1/3 cup (65 grams) packed dark brown sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1 1/2 tablespoons water", "1/4 cup (20 grams) dutch-process cocoa, plus more for dusting (see Note about using black cocoa)", "1/3 cup cake flour (40 grams) or 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch", "Heaped 1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "2 to 2 1/4 cups slightly softened ice cream of your choice (I used cookies and cream)", "Powdered sugar, hot fudge sauce, whipped cream, sprinkles, or all of the above to garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven: To 400 degrees F.

Sift cocoa powder over top of cake. Place a large (larger than the cake) dishcloth you don\u2019t mind getting dirty over it. Place a cutting board or baking tray or cooling rack over the cloth that\u2019s larger than the cake pan. Grab this board, the cloth, and the cake pan tightly together and flip the cake over, onto the cloth on the board. (The board just supports the cloth; its work here is done.) Lift your cake pan and it should unmold onto cloth. Gently peel the parchment paper off the cake. Use your paring knife to cut a thin edge (about 1/4-inch) off all sides of the cake; it\u2019s easier to roll with softer edges. Sift more cocoa powder over the back of the cake. Use the cloth it is on to roll it tightly into a spiral, within the dish towel. Rest on a cooling rack, seam side-down, until it reaches room temperature, about 30 minutes.

I use a small scooper to drop dollops all over, and a small offset spatula or knife to smooth it. Work quickly so it doesn\u2019t melt too much. Once ice cream is evenly spread, roll cake back up around it (minus the dish towel this time, but you can use it to help nudge cake into a coil). Wrap cake in plastic and freeze for at least 2 hours and preferably overnight, to re-firm the ice cream.
