So very sweet! So sweet that I thought that the sugar level was a typo but sure enough, every other recipe I found listed sugar amounts in cups. Ayee. This one only called for one but I reduced my batch to 3/4 of a cup for a bread-and-butter pickle we find on par with the level of sweetness you expect from them. As in, it is probably \u201ccorrect\u201d. But, I will still reduce it to a 1/2 cup next time, to accommodate my taste preference, as you should adjust it to yours.</p><p>I also reduced the turmeric, which seemed like way too much, and added celery seed, because I like it with pickles.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes 4 cups of pickles, filling a 1-quart jar", "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound cucumbers, sliced 1/4-inch thick \u2014 \u201cpickling\u201d or kirby cucumbers work best here", "1 large sweet onion, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup ", "<b>Diamond</b>", " Kosher salt [Updated: Why Diamond?
