However, if you wish to get a lead on them, you can make them, arrange them on your parchment-lined sheet and freeze them.

If you\u2019re preparing them more than one day in advance, once they are frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag or container. Bring them back to a parchment-lined sheet when you\u2019re ready to bake them. No need to defrost the froze, unbaked scones, just add 2 to 3 minutes to your baking time.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/07-whole-wheat-raspberry-ricotta-scones"}
