Be patient but watch the stove like a hawk as caramel changes color quickly, and only burns when you think you are safe leave the room for a second. Remove from the heat. Very gradually whisk in the remaining 3 1/2 cups of milk. (This is another great place for your <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/tips/a-whisk-for-the-corners/\">whisk for the corners</a>.)
