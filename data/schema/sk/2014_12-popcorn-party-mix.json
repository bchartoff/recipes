Melt the butter and keep cooking it, stirring occasionally and watching out for hisses and splatters, until the bits at the bottom of the melted butter puddle begin to turn golden and light brown. Remove from heat, and whisk in Worcestershire, sugar, spices and salt. If you ended up using pre-popped or seasoned popcorn with salt, or salted nuts or crackers, you might go easier on the salt. If you like your mix quite traditionally salty and none of your packaged ingredients were coated with salt, you might up it to a full teaspoon. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Pour butter-spice mixture over popcorn mix and toss, toss, toss, until all the ingredients are evenly coated.
