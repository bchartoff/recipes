There is almost nothing it doesn\u2019t make more delicious: eggs, potatoes, stews, couscous, sandwiches and more, and there are almost as many recipes as there are people who consume it. Most boil down to hot chiles ground with garlic, cumin, coriander, caraway and olive oil, often with a smidge of sundried tomatoes. You can make your own (I\u2019ve been eying <a href=\"http://www.thewednesdaychef.com/the_wednesday_chef/2008/08/harissa.html\">this recipe</a> for some time) or you can buy some (I brought home <a href=\"http://www.shopwiki.com/Traditional+Harissa+Spread+in+Extra+Virgin+Olive+Oil+by+Les+Moulins+Mahjoub\">this brand</a>, which we love). The adavantage of making your own, as always, is that you can adjust the recipe to suit your tastes and desired level of heat.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/05-carrot-salad-with-harissa-feta-and-mint"}
