Repeat this on the three remaining \u201csides,\u201d forming a small square, or you can aim for more of a rectangle if that\u2019s the shape your bread is. Leave the folded egg-and-cheese in the center of the skillet to cook for another 30 seconds, then slide onto your muffin or toast. Top the sandwich with the other half and eat immediately. Notice a couple sets of eyes gazing at you, perhaps wondering where their sandwich might be. Repeat a couple more times and not even mind because it\u2019s so easy."}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/02-bodega-style-egg-and-cheese-sandwich"}
