I made these first (preschooler\u2019s choice!) but have already bookmarked Bacon and Kale Polenta Squares, Strawberry Oat Breakfast Crisp, Vanilla and Cream Steel-Cut Oats Porridge, Creamy Breakfast Rice with Honey-Poached Figs and Pistachios and Zucchini-Farro Fritters, to give you an idea of what will await you when you buy the book. It\u2019s nothing short of what you\u2019d expect from the creator of Marge Granola.</p><p>This recipe, however, I tweaked it a bit, mostly because it used many bowls and I wanted it to use fewer. A bunch more notes: This calls for 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat (pastry flour was recommended) but I think it can be tweaked with any flour mix your prefer, be it mostly whole wheat or white whole wheat, or a gluten-free mix (Sprouted Kitchen smartly recommends 1/2 cup each of oat, almond and brown rice flour). I (always) think you could brown the butter. Yogurt thinned with a little milk could replace the buttermilk, as could coconut milk with 1 tablespoon lemon juice added, and coconut oil or olive oil could replace the butter, just to give you a few ideas. The bittersweet chocolate chunks were not necessary, but they were not regretted either.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Theoretically, 12 muffins, but I got 16.", "recipeIngredient": ["2 small-medium firm pears", "6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly (plus more for cups)", "2/3 cup (125 grams) natural cane sugar, such as Turbinado, light brown or granulated sugar", "1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3/4 cup (75 grams) rolled oats", "1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup (60 grams) whole wheat flour", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, which I replaced with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, which I replaced with 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup (120 grams) toasted hazelnuts, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup (85 grams) bittersweet chocolate chunks (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2 small-medium firm pears<br/>\n6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly (plus more for cups)<br/>\n2/3 cup (125 grams) natural cane sugar, such as Turbinado, light brown or granulated sugar<br/>\n1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk<br/>\n2 large eggs, lightly beaten<br/>\n1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br/>\n3/4 cup (75 grams) rolled oats<br/>\n1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1/2 cup (60 grams) whole wheat flour<br/>\n3/4 teaspoon baking soda<br/>\n2 teaspoons baking powder<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, which I replaced with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, which I replaced with 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated<br/>\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>\n1 cup (120 grams) toasted hazelnuts, coarsely chopped<br/>\n1/2 cup (85 grams) bittersweet chocolate chunks (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 425\u00b0F.
