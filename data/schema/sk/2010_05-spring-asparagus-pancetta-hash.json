The core idea is a one-pan hash that is lighter than the expected versions and full of texture; whether you get to this place with yellow potatoes or Russets, slab bacon or pancetta, asparagus or something else that struck your fancy at the market that week doesn\u2019t much matter. You don\u2019t even need to put an egg on it, if you\u2019re more in a broiled salmon or grilled cutlets kind of place tonight. But it\u2019s not half bad just the way it is, and I suspect this is going to become a weekend morning staple.

Fry the pancetta, turning it frequently so that it browns and crisps on all sides; this takes about 10 minutes. Remove it with a slotted spoon and drain it on paper towels.

If you\u2019re not using a cast iron, you might need to add a tablespoon or so of oil; if you\u2019ve skipped the pork, you\u2019ll want to start with 2 tablespoons oil.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Add the potatoes don\u2019t move them for a couple minutes.

(I add this now, not earlier, because I find it often burns before the potatoes are done.) Cook for an additional 5 minutes. Add the asparagus, cover the pan and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until crisply cooked. (Skinny asparagus will take just 5 minutes; thicker asparagus will take longer.) Remove the lid, return the pancetta to the pan for another minute, to reheat. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Serve immediately. </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/05-spring-asparagus-pancetta-hash"}
