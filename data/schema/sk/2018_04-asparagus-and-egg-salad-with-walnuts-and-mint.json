This idea that the asparagus knows exactly where to snap to separate the tender parts from the woody ends defies what I\u2019ve experienced, which is that asparagus will snap halfway between your hands, no matter where you place them. [The Asapargus-Snapping Truthers are going to come for me in the comments; I hope they are kind.] I like McFadden\u2019s suggestion more: choose one stalk from the bunch and snap or trim it to the right spot, then line up the remaining stalks and cut them to the same point.
