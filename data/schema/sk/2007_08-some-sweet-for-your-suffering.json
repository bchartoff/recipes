Otherwise, put the slices on a rack in a single layer into a 200-degree oven for 50 to 60 minutes, turning them once halfway through. If you use challah, the second choice for bread, cut it into 1/2-inch-thick slices. If neither potato bread nor challah is available, use good-quality white sandwich bread with a dense, soft texture. To ensure that this larger pudding unmolds in one piece, use a greased loaf pan lined with plastic wrap. Whipped cream is the perfect accompaniment to summer pudding.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeIngredient": ["2 pints fresh strawberries rinsed, hulled, and sliced 1  pint  fresh raspberries", "1/2 pint fresh blueberries", "1/2 pint fresh blackberries", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons lemon juice from 1 lemon", "8 slices potato bread (stale), challah, or other good-quality white bread "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2 pints fresh strawberries rinsed, hulled, and sliced 1  pint  fresh raspberries<br/>\n1/2 pint fresh blueberries<br/>\n1/2 pint fresh blackberries<br/>\n3/4 cup granulated sugar<br/>\n2 tablespoons lemon juice from 1 lemon<br/>\n8 slices potato bread (stale), challah, or other good-quality white bread </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1.
