It\u2019s okay if your potatoes are larger or smaller, they may just take more or less time to boil. You want to use Russet or Idaho potatoes here \u2014 you need a \u201cfloury\u201d not \u201cwaxy\u201d potato for it to crumble into nice, craggy nuggets. Look for a vegetable oil that\u2019s intended for high heats (most are, but best to check) and claims to be good for frying. If you can find it, peanut oil is my favorite for fried potatoes, but as I could not either, I can assure you that vegetable oil works fine.", "totalTime": "1 hour 30 minutes, plus chilling time", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium/large Russet potatoes", "Kosher salt", "2 cups vegetable or peanut oil", "Finishes of your choice (see suggestions in post)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Boil your potatoes: Place potatoes in a medium/large pot and cover with an inch or two of cold water and big spoonful of salt.
