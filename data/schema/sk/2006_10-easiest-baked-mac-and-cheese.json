I don\u2019t use cottage cheese anymore (I don\u2019t care for the slight graininess) but basically anything else \u2014 most often sour cream. You could also use ricotta (1:1) or for extra luxury creme fraiche or mascarpone \u2014 for these two, I use 1/2 cup plus an additional 1/2 cup of milk as a swap for 1 cup cottage cheese. These smoother types of dairy can be hand-stirred, no blender needed. 2. I\u2019ve found you can get away with 3/4 of the cheese for a little less cheddar intensity, should you wish. Finally, as shown in the updated photos, I love baking this in a quiche pan of mine, but it fits best with 75% of the below recipe (i.e. 3/4 cup sour cream, 1.5 cups milk, 2/3 to 3/4 pound (see previous note) cheddar, and 6 ounces of pasta).
