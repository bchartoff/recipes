A tarte tatin was born!\u201d etc. \u2014 to ring authentic. The Manhattan cocktail is no different. One disputed theory holds that the drink originated at the Manhattan Club in New York City in the 1870s, where it was created for a banquet that involved everyone from Winton Churchill\u2019s mom to a failed presidential candidate that was so successful, everyone wanted the drink too.  Another, also disputed, argues that it was invented by a bartender named Black in the 1860s. I\u2019m far more enchanted to have read about a North Frisian island named F\u00f6hr where the Manhattan cocktail is said to be popular \u2014 apparently many people there immigrated to Manhattan and back again at one point, taking the drink with them \u2014 mostly because they apparently make it just the way we like it: a little dry. Is it true?

Canada produces a lot of rye whiskey, but by their own regulations. Bourbon must be distilled from at least 51% corn. It must be made in America and is most often made in Kentucky. Tennessee whiskey, basically bourbon whiskey from Tennessee, uses something called the Lincoln County Process in which whiskey, after it is distilled, is filtered through sugar-maple charcoal, making it amazing. American rye tends to be more dry and spicy than bourbon, which is fuller in body with a vanilla/caramel vibe. Rye is more traditional in the Manhattan cocktail, largely because Manhattan was a rye town when the drink was hatched in the late 1800s. How did I do? </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>Angostura vs. peychauds vs. orange bitters:</strong> Angostura, traditional for the Manhattan, is made from a secret recipe, and is quite aromatic. Peychauds, slightly spicier and more sweet, is a great second choice (and what I used instead). Orange bitters are not traditional, but I think taste great in an Manhattan, although giving it more of an old-fashioned vibe.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/09-the-perfect-manhattan"}
