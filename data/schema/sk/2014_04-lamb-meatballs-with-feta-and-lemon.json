However, from what I\u2019m reading, those of you that are browning your meatballs first are finding that they hold up in the sauce (what I usually do), and those that are not are finding that they fall apart a bit. If you\u2019re not going to brown the meatballs first, I\u2019m going to suggest that you instead use only 3 tablespoons water. The recipe is now updated accordingly. I hope that helps going forward and apologize for any trouble this caused.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "About 36 small meatballs (I use a 3T scoop to yield 1.5 to 2-inch meatballs)", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Meatballs</u>", "3 to 8 tablespoons water", "2 pounds ground lamb", "1 large egg", "1 1/4 cup (about 70 grams) breadcrumbs, fresh or plain, such as Panko", "1/2 cup (55 grams) crumbled feta cheese", "3/4 teaspoon table salt", "Pinch of red pepper flakes", "2 small garlic cloves, minced", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons (35 grams) tomato paste", "Zest of half a lemon", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Sauce</u>", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1 garlic clove, minced", "A couple glugs of red wine or white/dry vermouth (optional)", "1 28-ounce (795 grams) can of crushed or pureed tomatoes", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "Zest of half a lemon", "3/4 to 1 teaspoon table salt", "Pinches of red pepper flakes (to taste)", "1/3 cup (about 45 grams) pitted, chopped kalamata olives", "1 tablespoon thinly sliced mint leaves, plus more for garnish", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley, plus more for garnish", "Juice of one lemon", "1/4 cup (30 grams) crumbled feta, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Sauce</u><br/>\n1 medium onion, finely chopped<br/>\n1 garlic clove, minced<br/>\nA couple glugs of red wine or white/dry vermouth (optional)<br/>\n1 28-ounce (795 grams) can of crushed or pureed tomatoes<br/>\n1 teaspoon dried oregano<br/>\nZest of half a lemon<br/>\n3/4 to 1 teaspoon table salt<br/>\nPinches of red pepper flakes (to taste)<br/>\n1/3 cup (about 45 grams) pitted, chopped kalamata olives<br/>\n1 tablespoon thinly sliced mint leaves, plus more for garnish<br/>\n2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley, plus more for garnish<br/>\nJuice of one lemon<br/>\n1/4 cup (30 grams) crumbled feta, for garnish</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Make meatballs:</i> If you plan don\u2019t plan to brown the meatballs, use only 3 tablespoons water.
