I realized quite a bit after making this cake that my candy thermometer was not worth the $2.99 I\u2019d spent on it. Who knew?! The temperature reading always ran way cold, so when you make this at home, you\u2019ll find that your caramel is thinner and will sink into the cake more. This is actually correct, or the way caramel cakes traditionally come out. Want yours to come out thick and drape-y the way it is pictured here? Boil it a bit hotter \u2014 but be careful. And be warned \u2014 despite the fact that draped caramel looks very pretty, the next day it was a bit awkward to bit through a thick, almost fondant-like caramel layer to get to that delicious cake within.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>For the cake</u>", "2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sifted cake flour (not self-rising; sift before measuring)", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 stick unsalted butter, softened", "1 cup sugar", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "2 large eggs, at room temperature 30 minutes", "1 cup well-shaken buttermilk", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>For caramel glaze</u>", "1 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup packed light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon light corn syrup", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "Equipment: a candy thermometer"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>For caramel glaze</u><br/>\n1 cup heavy cream<br/>\n1/2 cup packed light brown sugar<br/>\n1 tablespoon light corn syrup<br/>\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>\nEquipment: a candy thermometer</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make the cake: </u> Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F with rack in middle.
