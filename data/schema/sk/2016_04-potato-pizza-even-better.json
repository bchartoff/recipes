Wood-burning ovens historically weren\u2019t allowed to run until 6 p.m. in Rome, and this was the delicious modification that emerged. Potato pizza is a variation on the gold standard of Roman bread, pizza bianca \u2014 pizza with just olive oil, rosemary and salt that amounts to so much more than it sounds. \nDid you read that part about the electric oven? Unlike most of the pizza gushed over these days, this is not pizza optimized for 900-degree pizza ovens notably absent in most homes, but the ovens we already have. Not that it wouldn\u2019t be amazing in a wood-fired pizza oven, but if you don\u2019t have one in that cramped studio walk-up, you\u2019re not going to start this recipe already at a loss.\nDespite struggling with his first printed version, Lahey himself came to the rescue in 2012 with a much easier to follow potato pizza recipe in his first book that I\u2019ve had great success with, so let us all applaud the silent co-authors of cookbooks that make great chef recipes work for the rest of us. The newer version lets us know exactly how big of a tray you\u2019ll need, uses more potatoes, a simpler process of preparing them and I mean, just look at the results. (Well, not too closely. I was busy with a baby a nearly burnt mine.)\nWant to make this with sweet potatoes? Lahey says that this version [Pizza Batata] should be made with slightly more water (4 1/2 cups) for the same amount of salt, and that 2 sweet potatoes (800 grams) is all you\u2019ll need. Skip the rosemary.\n</p><p>1 recipe pizza dough (below) or about a 2/3 volume of my lazy fitted-to-your-schedule favorite or your favorite, whichever it may be</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["4 teaspoons fine sea or table salt", "6 to 8 (1 kilo) small to medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled", "1 medium yellow onion, diced", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "4 to 5 tablespoons olive oil", "About 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>4 teaspoons fine sea or table salt<br/>\n6 to 8 (1 kilo) small to medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled<br/>\n1 medium yellow onion, diced<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n4 to 5 tablespoons olive oil<br/>\nAbout 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a medium bowl, combine the 1 quart lukewarm water with salt, stirring until the salt has dissolved.
