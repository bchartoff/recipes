You can reduce your dishload by lining your zucchini baking sheet with aluminum foil (tomatoes are reactive with aluminum so I\u2019d leave their tray bare) and hoping that you\u2019ll consider using one skillet for the rice and onions. Despite the fact that I couldn\u2019t reduce the moderate dishload further, we\u2019ve never once felt that this dish wasn\u2019t worth the extra suds. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves: 4 to 6 as a side", "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup uncooked white rice, long-grain is suggested but use whatever you prefer", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds zucchini (about 3 medium), sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1/2 pound plum tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "Table salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 medium onion, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan, divided"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1/3 cup uncooked white rice, long-grain is suggested but use whatever you prefer<br/>\n5 tablespoons olive oil<br/>\n1 1/2 pounds zucchini (about 3 medium), sliced 1/4-inch thick<br/>\n1/2 pound plum tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick<br/>\nTable salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1 medium onion, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced<br/>\n3 garlic cloves, minced<br/>\n2 large eggs, lightly beaten<br/>\n1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves<br/>\n1/2 cup grated Parmesan, divided</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F.
