While they were certainly not unwelcome, you\u2019re not going to need them here to make a great, even vegetarian, frittata. \nMy favorite peeler for ribbon-ing asparagus, and well, basically everything is a y-shaped one. I have this one. I like it so much get stressed when it\u2019s in the dishwasher and I have to be away from it for an hour. \nI ended up expecting to use 4 ounces of goat cheese but only used 2. Use the amount that looks good to you; if you buy too much, the extra is great crumbled on at the end, or basically on anything, in my opinion. You could, of course, use a handful of any other cheese that you prefer here.
