A blend of pork, beef, and veal is traditional. I usually go half-half with the first two, but I\u2019ve also made these entirely with ground turkey (a mix with dark meat it in is much better) and they\u2019re a little softer (you could use a tablespoon less milk) but taste delicious. You can skip the parmesan and replace the milk with water if you want to make it dairy-free. You could use ricotta instead of milk for extra richness. You could add finely chopped prosciutto to the meat mixture, or even use ground sausage meat for half of the meat mixture. You can use 1 tablespoon finely grated onion instead of onion powder, and you could make your own breadcrumbs from any old piece of bread and grinding it up \u2014 use 2/3 cup instead of 1/2.", "totalTime": "P0DT0H50M0S", "recipeYield": "4 and up to 6 with sides", "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground meat (see note up top for suggestions)", "1/2 cup panko-style breadcrumbs", "1/3 cup milk, any kind", "2 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, plus more to serve", "2 tablespoons finely grated parmesan or pecorino romano cheese, plus more to serve", "2 teaspoons coarse or kosher salt, divided", "Red pepper flakes and/or freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "2 large eggs", "3 garlic cloves, minced, divided", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes", "1 pound dried spaghetti"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of very well-salted water to boil and heat your oven to 425 degrees F.

Add half of reserved pasta water and cook spaghetti and sauce over high heat for one minute, tossing the whole time. Use additional pasta water as needed to loosen. Use tongs to transfer spaghetti into a large, wide serving bowl. (If you give the bowl a little spin as you lower the spaghetti into it, you can make cute little piles.) Add the meatballs and their sauce on top. Garnish with parsley and additional grated cheese.
