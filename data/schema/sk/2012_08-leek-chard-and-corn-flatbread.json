Here\u2019s how: Prepare your filling and set it aside. Roll or stretch out your doughs. Get your grill going at a high temperature and brush the grates with oil. Throw the first raw dough down right on them. After a few minutes, it will be black and blistered underneath. Flip it off the grill, landing it ungrilled (top) side down on a platter. Spread half the filling over it and slide it back on the grill for 5 to 7 minutes with the top down, until charred slightly at the edges. Repeat with remaining filling and dough. Invite me over.</p><p>Because this tends to irk me in other recipes, it\u2019s only fair that I warn you that the toppings will not glue to the flatbread. To do so would require a lot of melty cheese or wetter ingredients and really, this is delightful with neither. You can pick up squares with your hand (but no handsprings, okay?) or eat them with knife and fork. The flavors taste like they were always meant to be together, and if you\u2019re me, you\u2019ll miss it long after you\u2019ve finished your leftovers.</p><p>About 1 1/2 pounds pizza dough (from two of these, or store-bought)</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes 2 large (9x13ish inches) flatbreads", "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "3 large leeks (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "1 12-ounce bundle chard or about 6 cups (6 ounces) of leaves, cut into 1/2-inch ribbons", "1/2 teaspoon table salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup fresh corn kernels (cut from 1 to 2 medium ears corn)", "Cornmeal, for sprinkling baking surface", "4-ounce goat cheese log, cold"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil<br/>\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br/>\n3 large leeks (about 1 1/2 pounds)<br/>\n1 12-ounce bundle chard or about 6 cups (6 ounces) of leaves, cut into 1/2-inch ribbons<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon table salt<br/>\nFreshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1 cup fresh corn kernels (cut from 1 to 2 medium ears corn)<br/>\nCornmeal, for sprinkling baking surface<br/>\n4-ounce goat cheese log, cold</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Trim the ends off your leeks and halve them lengthwise.
