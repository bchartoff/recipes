If so, listen closely: this recipe is easier than you can imagine. For the crust, you can go ahead and grind your cookies and pecans (no need to pre-chop, although it helps to break up the cookies a little), and sugars together to make fine crumbs, then even add cold (!) butter in cubes and run the machine until the mixture clumps.  You can then wipe out your food processor bowl (not even fully wash it, it doesn\u2019t matter) and make the cheesecake layer in there. But I put the ingredients in a different order: First in the bowl go the sugars, then cold (!) cream cheese, cut into a few chunks. Blend and blend together until it\u2019s absolutely smooth, no lumps at all. Scrape down the sides. Now add pumpkin, cornstarch, salt, and spices and blend to combine. Add the eggs one at time, blending briefly between additions. Add the cream and bourbon, if using. That\u2019s it; you can go ahead and pour it over the crust now and bake it as written above."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Want to make cheesecake bars? I use a 9\u00d713-inch cake pan and line the bottom and sides with one large piece of foil with no tears in it. (I find that flipping your cake pan over and molding the foil over top and sides first, before flipping it back over and lining the pan with this foil, causes less tearing.) Coat it lightly with butter or nonstick spray. I like to use a 1.5x or 2x the crust recipe, or it\u2019s just too thin to hold up. Press it across the bottom and then 1/2-inch up the sides, then chill it as you do above. Make the pumpkin layer as written above and pour it on top. This bakes at 350\u00b0F for 30 to 40 minutes (check it at 30, then 35 to be safe), i.e. it\u2019s much faster. Continue with the sour cream topping as written. To serve it once totally chilled, carefully lift the whole pan out using the foil sling and transfer it to your counter. Use a knife dipped in hot water to make clean slices, and wipe the knife between cuts. I cut mine into 24 squares."}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11-bourbon-pumpkin-cheesecake"}
