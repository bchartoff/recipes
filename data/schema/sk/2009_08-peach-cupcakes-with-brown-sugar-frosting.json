Let me explain: Quick buttercreams and cream cheese frostings are generally made by whipping fatty ingredients (butter, cream cheese, yes please) with powdered sugar. Powdered sugar works in a way that granulated sugar does not because it is mixed with cornstarch, which both keeps the sugar from clumping in its packaging and thickens the frosting. Brown sugar is not only more damp than granulated and powdered sugar, it\u2019s missing that cornstarch thickener, so I added some to help the frosting set up. It\u2019s still a bit thinner than traditional cream cheese frosting but the flavor leaves the stuff you\u2019re used to in the dust.
