After several conversations with readers/test cooks who found that their cake stuck a little, awesome reader Susan tried to cool the cake completely in the pan before releasing it and nothing stuck. I agree that this might be a better way to go.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11-ganached-guinness-goodness"}
