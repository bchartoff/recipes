Fantastic, but considering that it involves butter, hazelnuts, nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar and plums, you probably don\u2019t need to tell me that. The aroma from your kitchen will beckon strangers to your door; it weakens steel dessert wills. I mentioned that the custard filling gave me pause but we ended up liking it a lot, it was less of a jiggly baked custard and more like something that bound the plums nicely together. However, if we are being completely honest, I would love love love love love to exchange the custard mixture for a cream cheese custard (i.e. cheesecake) mixture next time. I believe it would be deadly delicious. I have not (repeat: have not) tested this, but my hunch is that you could replace the 1/3 cup heavy cream with a 3 ounce package of softened cream cheese, beaten with the eggs, sugar, flour and milk. I\u2019d love to hear if any of you pull this off.</p><p>I nixed the raspberries in the original recipe and replaced them with extra plum. I love raspberries but I don\u2019t think they were necessary here (and vaguely remember the late 1990s as being a time when everything from roast chicken to chocolate sauces had raspberry in it, aye, thus, maybe the inclusion was more a product of that time). My only other heads-up about the recipe is that, given that it is a crumb base, it does start to get soggy on the second day. Not terribly so, nobody is going to push it away, dejected, because of the added moisture, but this tart is definitely the most sturdy in the first 24 to 48 hours.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Crust and crumbs</u>", "3/4 cup unsalted butter (6 ounces or 175 grams), chilled, cut into small pieces, plus more for pan", "1/3 cup (1 3/4 ounces or 50 grams) hazelnuts", "1 1/2 cups (195 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar", "1/3 cup packed (65 grams) light or dark brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "1 pound (455 grams) ripe but firm plums (about 4 standard black ones or 12 smaller Italian plums; I used a mix of both)", "1 tablespoon (10 grams) all-purpose flour", "6 tablespoons (75 grams) granulated sugar", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "1 large egg yolk", "1/3 cup (80 ml) heavy cream", "1/4 cup (60 ml) milk", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Grated nutmeg, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling</u><br/>\n1 pound (455 grams) ripe but firm plums (about 4 standard black ones or 12 smaller Italian plums; I used a mix of both)<br/>\n1 tablespoon (10 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n6 tablespoons (75 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\n1 large egg, lightly beaten<br/>\n1 large egg yolk<br/>\n1/3 cup (80 ml) heavy cream<br/>\n1/4 cup (60 ml) milk<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>\nGrated nutmeg, optional</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat you oven to 350 degrees F.

Press 3 cups of crumb into the bottom of the prepared pan and about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the pan to form crust; I like to use the bottom and side of a heavy measuring cup to help press the crumbs neatly down and up the side, forming a nice inner corner. Set remaining crumb mixture (about 1 1/2 cups) aside. Transfer crust to the oven; bake until it appears to be set, 15 to 20 minutes; go easy on this baking time as I found it was easy to overbake the outer corners of the tart base in the final baking. It\u2019s going to slump a wee bit in the oven; feel free to press the sides back up the sides with the back of a metal spoon when it comes out of the oven to get them back in place. Set aside to cool (the fridge will expedite this for you).</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Slice plums in half, and remove pits.

That extra color will translate to deeper flavor and looser skins; everyone wins. Some people like to rub the nuts in a dishtowel to loosen the skins but I hate the mess this makes all over my kitchen when I inevitably forget that the towel is a mess of flakes and pick it up. Instead, with dry hands, I roll a few together between my palms until the skins come off and the mess stays on the tray. In general, I almost never get all of the skins off but it doesn\u2019t matter; as long as most of the skins are removed, you won\u2019t have any nagging bitterness.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08-hazelnut-plum-crumb-tart"}
