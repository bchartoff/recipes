Oh you didn\u2019t do this and you need to make the stuffing right now? Spread them on a baking sheet and dry them in the oven at 300&$176;F until firm but not brown.\nThe day of, at any point, or an hour before you want to serve the stuffing: Heat oven to 350\u00b0F. Generously butter a 9\u00d713-inch baking dish. I always forget to do this. Don\u2019t forget. It will absolutely stick if you don\u2019t. Add challah cubes to the dish.\nIn a large frying pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add celery, leeks, half the salt and pepper, and cook, stirring here at there, until the celery is mostly tender and onions are translucent and sweet, about 10 minutes. Add sage, rosemary, and thyme and cook for one minute more. Sprinkle over challah cubes along with parsley. Use your hands \u2014 it\u2019s so much easier this way \u2014 to gently disperse the vegetables through the challah, being careful not to let all the vegetables fall through to the bottom.\nAdd remaining salt and pepper to broth (although if your broth is very salty, maybe you will want less) and pour it over the challah. Challah is very tender, even when stale, so it doesn\u2019t need soaking time.\nCover pan tightly with foil and bake for 20 minutes, then increase the oven heat to 425\u00b0F. Remove the foil and drizzle challah with remaining 6 tablespoons of melted butter, you don\u2019t want to skimp on this. Return the pan to the oven and bake the stuffing for another 15 minutes, until the top edges are crisped and it\u2019s nicely browned on top.\nServe right away or reheat when needed at 350\u00b0F (foil-on because it\u2019s already well-browned.\nOther ways to make this ahead: You can just bake it for the foil-on portion the day before and blast it at the higher heat before you serve it, although if it\u2019s coming from the cold fridge, it may need 20 minutes, not 15.\nTools: This is my forever easy favorite baking dish, although I\u2019m down to 2 of them after dish-cident this weekend, woe.\nNotes:Should you wish to add [insert whatever stuffing ingredient you wish was here, like sausage or mushrooms], you absolutely can.

Cubes provide better overall texture.If the photos look generous, it\u2019s because I\u2019m making a double batch because I do think you should have two pans for more than 16 people.
