The thing is, she gives great and extensively detailed directions, but my thing is, I like to pare things down a little bit, especially when it comes to bread. I honestly believe that once you are certain your yeast is working, it\u2019s harder to mess up a loaf of bread than it is to make it delicious. Follow the rising times and size pointers, see that it\u2019s kneaded well and baked at the right temperature and you can have a little bit of New York City in your kitchen without a lot less dingy gray snow and loud sirens.</p><p>Set aside 8 hours for this. Yes, eight. You\u2019ll only need to be hands-on for about 30 minutes of it, and you\u2019re welcome to run errands in the rising intervals, but you need to be able to check in every hour or two.
