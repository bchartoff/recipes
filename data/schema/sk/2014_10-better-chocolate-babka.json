It\u2019s okay if it\u2019s on the dry side, but if it doesn\u2019t come together at all, add extra water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms a mass. With the mixer on low, add the salt, then the butter, a spoonful at a time, mixing until it\u2019s incorporated into the dough. Then, mix on medium speed for 10 minutes until dough is completely smooth; you\u2019ll need to scrape the bowl down a few times. I usually found that after 10 minutes, the dough began to pull away from the sides of the bowl. If it doesn\u2019t, you can add 1 tablespoon extra flour to help this along. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Coat a large bowl with oil (or scrape the dough out onto a counter and oil this one) and place dough inside, cover with plastic and refrigerate.

Don\u2019t worry if this step makes a mess, just transfer the twist as best as you can into the prepared loaf pan. In one batch, mine was long enough to \u201cS\u201d inside the pan and I nested the trimmed ends of the log in the openings. Even if you don\u2019t (and choose to bake them separately in a little pan, as I did in other batches), the dough will fill in any gaps by the time it\u2019s done rising and baking, so don\u2019t worry.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise another 1 to 1 1/2 hours at room temperature.
