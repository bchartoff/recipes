You can make it more straightforward by omitting the cumin.  I use nutmeg instead of mace, because who has mace sitting around their kitchen?  Not me.</p><p>The ribs go really well with basic coleslaw\u2013nothing too fancy.  Deb made some scrumptious slaw for Memorial Day, and some tasty BBQ beans too.

When you smoke these babies for as long as three hours, you end up with a completely tender result, though the meat on baby-back ribs is technically \u201cmore tender.\u201d   I am feeding a crowd of hungry, eager people when I do this, and I would have to spend twice as much money (read: over $100) on meat if I used baby-back instead of St. Louis-style ribs.  Plus there wouldn\u2019t be enough room on the grill to make dinner for everyone.  You have to eat at least six baby-back ribs to be happy, as opposed to three St. Louis-style\u2019s.  For my first experiments with BBQ, I used the pre-packaged racks of ribs that are available in most supermarkets\u2019 meat departments for about $12 apiece, but the fresher they are, the better.  In fact,  I would advise you to ask your butcher when (s)he gets deliveries of fresh ribs, and plan your BBQ-ing accordingly.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><b>Prepping the Ribs:</b>  I don\u2019t cut out the connective tissue/membrane before cooking.  I realize there is a massive, contentious debate about this in BBQ-ing circles, but I don\u2019t really have an opinion on the matter, other than (1) it seems tricky and time-consuming; (2) I don\u2019t know how; (3) I can\u2019t imagine that the ribs could be any more tender.  The membrane basically breaks down during the cooking process.  Maybe it leaves a bit of a ultra-thin, crispy remnant on the bone side of the ribs.  I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t feel the need to perform this surgery.  It seems like an unnecessary fuss if you ask me.  Well, it looks like maybe I did have an opinion on the matter, doesn\u2019t it?  I like the membrane, OK?  I like the crispy little membrane wafer you get when you\u2019re done.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><b>Cooking the Ribs:</b></p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/05-mollys-dry-rubbed-ribs"}
