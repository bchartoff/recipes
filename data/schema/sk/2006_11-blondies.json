For years, before every party, I\u2019d mix up a pan of these basically from memory because that\u2019s how easy they are: 1 (stick of butter) + 1 (cup of sugar) + 1 (egg) + 1 (cup of flour) + 1 1/2 (cups of mix-ins, for me usually chocolate chips and nuts but your mileage may vary, maybe you like dried fruit or crumbled heath bars or candy canes here, I mean, who wouldn\u2019t? but more suggestions are at the end), then 20 minutes in the oven for extra-gooey, 25 for set but still buttery, and look, you did it, and all in one bowl in under 45 minutes. I began making them with brown butter in 2014 and have never looked back.

However the original images were a little confusing because for parties, I\u2019d always cut them into little 1-inch squares as I believe that all foods eaten standing up, especially at parties, shouldn\u2019t be more than a single bite, at a time or becomes complicated to hold your drink too, or worse, you get crumbs in it, which would be unacceptable.

That would make them cake. I have no interest in either being cakey. I prefer them chewy, with just a little puff and crackle that comes from baking with an egg. If you must add baking powder, I won\u2019t judge; the common measurement for a blondie recipe of this volume is 3/4 teaspoon.
