I don\u2019t believe you need zillion dollar, hard-to-find ingredients to cook well. But there are some recipes, recipes that get their primary flavor from a single ingredient where that quality of that ingredient largely informs the quality of the end product. (I\u2019m thinking of the butter in shortbread, the stock in risotto or soup, etc.) In this case, that cocoa you splurged on that one time for a special occasion might just be ready for its closeup. I went for what I consider \u201cla creme\u201d, Valrhona \u2014 I\u2019m throwing this out there not to pressure you to buy something you might feel is out of your budget, but so so you know why my cookies are so dark; Valrhona is a very intense cocoa \u2014 but if you have another decadent favorite on hand, go for it.</p><p>These cookies are crisp and not overly sweet. They\u2019d be good with anything from coffee to ice cream to fancier things, like ice cream sandwiches, crumb crusts and icebox cakes (scroll down for an Icebox Cupcake recipe). </p><p>Last note: As an icebox cookie, these will take longer to soften than the store-bought wafers, so set aside more time than you normally would.
