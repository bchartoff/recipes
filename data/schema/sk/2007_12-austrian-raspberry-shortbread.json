The first was that although the shortbread is wonderful plain, it is it, indeed, plain. I think a little lemon zest, a splash of vanilla or even both would work deliciously in the dough, and against the raspberry. The suggested baking time is almost half of what I needed to get them solidified and lightly golden in the oven\u2013mine took an hour, in the end, and I do not suggest you take them out before they truly look done. Finally, I knew immediately that raspberry jam could not be spread over a pile of cookie shards, and plopped it into a piping bag with a big tip instead. A zip-lock bag with a 1/2-inch corner cut off would work as well. If your jam is particularly thick, you might want to heat it briefly to liquefy it slightly, though my seedless variety didn\u2019t require this. Finally, with this especially (but also, all bar cookie and brownies), I find that they\u2019re much easier to make clean cuts in when thoroughly chilled in the fridge. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, slightly softened", "4 egg yolks", "2 cups granulated sugar", "4 cups all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "Optional additions: 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 teaspoon lemon zest", "1 cup raspberry jam, at room temperature", "1/4 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, slightly softened<br/>\n4 egg yolks<br/>\n2 cups granulated sugar<br/>\n4 cups all-purpose flour<br/>\n2 teaspoons baking powder<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon salt<br/>\nOptional additions: 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 teaspoon lemon zest<br/>\n1 cup raspberry jam, at room temperature<br/>\n1/4 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Cream the butter in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer) until soft and fluffy.
