The raspberry jam filling couldn\u2019t be easier, and whether you cover the cake with a whipped bittersweet ganache (as we did), a Swiss buttercream or cream cheese frosting, it\u2019s guaranteed to be the prettiest little thing to cut into.</p><p>Oh, and if you have a friend who loves nothing more than a good seven-layer (rainbow) cookie, don\u2019t resist the temptation to tint the top layer green and the bottom one pink. Gah, can you imagine how adorable it would be?</p><p>The Happy Birthday Mom was piped with a handful of white chocolate chips melted with a teaspoon of cream and tinted with blue food dye before letting it thicken to a piping consistency. It was a little puddly to write with, but still so much tastier than those awful tubed things.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes a 9-inch triple layer cake that serves 16 to 20 people", "recipeIngredient": ["4 1/2 cups cake flour", "4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon salt", "2/3 cup prepared almond paste (7 ounces)", "2 2/3 cups sugar", "2 1/2 sticks (10 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon almond extract", "10 egg whites", "1 1/2 cups whole milk", "RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>For assembly:</u>", "1 cup simple syrup (to keep cake moist)(optional)", "1 cup seedless raspberry preserves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>For assembly:</u><br/>\n1 cup simple syrup (to keep cake moist)(optional)<br/>\n1 cup seedless raspberry preserves</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Frosting ideas:</u> <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07/project-wedding-cake-swiss-buttercream/\">Swiss Buttercream</a> (with or without two teaspoons of almond extract for flavoring), <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/09/red-velvet-cake/\">Cream Cheese Frosting</a> or Whipped Bittersweet Frosting (recipe below)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1.
