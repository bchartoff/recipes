Rubbing the exposed sides or anywhere your knife touched the \u2018choke with the cut side of a lemon half prevents this, but it\u2019s honestly impossible to prevent all browning, no matter how careful you are. Here\u2019s the good news: I find it really doesn\u2019t matter. The browning has no effect whatsoever on taste, and also disappears the second the artichokes go into boiling water.

For baby artichokes, cut off bottom 1/3 of leaves.
