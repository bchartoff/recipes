Except, in hindsight, I think I\u2019d also enjoy this recipe without the bread. It would be a bit thinner and saucier and possibly harder to slop onto a piece of toast, but also a bit lighter \u2014 in weight, not just calories. If you\u2019re bread-averse or think you\u2019d enjoy it without the crumbs in the sauce, give it a spin and let us know how it goes.</p><p>Tomato sauce, by the way, is emphatically not traditional in this dish but after making Ximena\u2019s version with it \u2014 she says \u201cyou don\u2019t have to use tomato in this recipe, but it\u2019s so much better with it\u201d \u2014 I can\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>Last note: This recipe is flexible.

No presoaking, just cover them 2 to 3 inches of water and cook them 3 hours on high. (I have learned that cooking time can vary widely in slow-cookers so allot more time than you might need. I often make mine in the day or days before and let them cool in their cooking water, which is then by then very flavorful.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>** This might be my favorite ingredient on earth \u2014 it\u2019s amazing on eggs and potatoes, too.
