I don\u2019t think anyone is buying watermelon by the ounce, but rather grabbing what their store or market has. On a flavor note: I love this ingredient combination (watermelon and cucumber and salty, crunchy accents) so much, if you\u2019re feeling creative, here are a few more directions do go with it: 1. Add some fresh slivered mint leaves and or razor-thin slivers of red onion. 2. Add the chile-lime flavors we use in this melon salad, or 3. I am eager to make this with a Indian chaat flavor vibe; if you can find chat masala spice packets, I promise it will be absolutely glorious sprinkled over this salad at the end. (This is my go-to brand.)", "totalTime": "P0DT0H15M0S", "recipeYield": "4", "recipeIngredient": ["About 1/4 a large seedless watermelon or 1 small (mini) watermelon", "2 small (Perisan-style) seedless cucumber, thinly sliced", "8 ounces ricotta salata, cut into matchsticks", "1/4 cup toasted, salted pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds)", "Olive oil, for drizzling", "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepperr"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For small watermelon, halve it and then place each half cut side down and cut each half into 8 pie-like slices.
