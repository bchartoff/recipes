Try to get them a little charred underneath before you move them around. Once they\u2019ve begun to brown, add the onions, plus some salt. Wait again for some color to develop before you move them. When peppers are nicely charred in spots and onions have softened and sweetened, scrape mixture onto a plate or bowl to clear the skillet. Heat skillet again on a very high heat with a thin slick of olive oil. Spread chicken strips in as much of a single layer as you can. Wait until they brown underneath to move them. Saute strips, regularly pausing so that they can get some color, until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Return peppers and onions to skillet. Heat again until everything is sizzling and bring to the table.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Eat immediately, spooned onto warm tortillas and piled with fixings of your choice.
