I would like you to know that if you\u2019re buying European butter (and oh, if there was ever a time to splurge on it, it is here) in European packages, most will come in 250-gram blocks which is (drumroll) within 5 grams of what you need here and the recipe works perfectly even without this 5-gram pat of butter.", "totalTime": "P0DT2H30M0S", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (9 ounces or 255 grams) salted butter, cold, cut into small pieces", "1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar", "1/4 cup (50 grams) light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract", "2 1/4 cups (295 grams) all-purpose flour", "6 ounces (170 grams) semi- or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (you want chunks, not thin shards of chocolate)", "1 large egg", "Demerara, turbinado, raw, or sanding sugar, for rolling", "Flaky sea salt for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Beat the butter, granulated and brown sugars, and vanilla with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl as needed.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to get golden brown.
