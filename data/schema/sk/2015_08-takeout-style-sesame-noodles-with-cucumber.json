Chinese sesame paste is made with toasted sesame seeds, while Middle Eastern tahini is usually made with plain, untoasted seeds. I used tahini, because it\u2019s what I had on hand, and it works just fine. You can add an extra splash of toasted sesame oil to compensate for any lost toasted sesame flavor, if you wish. Peanut allergies? Just use sesame seed paste entirely here, and toasted sesame seeds for garnish. The flavor will be slightly different, but no less delicious. 2 teaspoons chile-garlic paste is the original recommendation but we just dotted it on the grown-up bowls, so not to scare the heat-averse 5 year-old. Note: while soy sauces are naturally gluten-free, some are brewed using trace amounts of wheat, and if you are gluten-free, it\u2019s best to look for a clear gluten-free label before buying one. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4, generously, and up to double that if served as shown, with lots of cucumber, peanuts and herbs", "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound dried rice noodles (see notes up top)", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, plus a splash to loosen noodles", "2 tablespoons Chinese sesame paste or tahini (see note up top)", "1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter", "3 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons Chinese rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon granulated or brown sugar", "1 tablespoon finely grated ginger", "2 teaspoons minced garlic (from 1 medium-large clove)", "Chili-garlic paste, to taste", "1/2 pound cucumber, very thinly sliced", "1/2 cup roasted salted peanuts, roughly chopped", "A handful of chopped fresh herbs, such as mint and cilantro, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>3/4 pound dried rice noodles (see notes up top)<br/>\n2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, plus a splash to loosen noodles<br/>\n2 tablespoons Chinese sesame paste or tahini (see note up top)<br/>\n1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter<br/>\n3 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce<br/>\n2 tablespoons Chinese rice vinegar<br/>\n1 tablespoon granulated or brown sugar<br/>\n1 tablespoon finely grated ginger<br/>\n2 teaspoons minced garlic (from 1 medium-large clove)<br/>\nChili-garlic paste, to taste<br/>\n1/2 pound cucumber, very thinly sliced<br/>\n1/2 cup roasted salted peanuts, roughly chopped<br/>\nA handful of chopped fresh herbs, such as mint and cilantro, for garnish</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Cook noodles according to package directions and rinse with cold water to cool.
