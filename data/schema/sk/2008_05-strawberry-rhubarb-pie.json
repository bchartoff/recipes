However, when I came home I read all 134 comments about this recipe on Epicurious.com and found not a single mention of wetness, thus I\u2019ve decided that it was just a freak fruit occurrence or bad measuring on my part, and not worth warning you about. Especially because this was gone in about 4.2 minutes, and I didn\u2019t hear anyone complain.</p><p>Update: Because so many readers reported sloshiness \u2014 i.e. this pie tends to be too wet \u2014 I\u2019ve updated this recipe with an improved version: Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie, Improved.
