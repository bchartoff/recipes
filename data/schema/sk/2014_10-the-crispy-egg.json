Within a minute, it should get brown at the edges but don\u2019t touch or move it. Let it cook until the white looks fully opaque, another 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Shimmy a thin metal spatula under the egg, gently loosening any stuck parts.

I\u2019d definitely recommend this, especially as an extra layer of security that the white will be fully cooked. [Updated to note that I did this a couple mornings later, and whee! The whites were even more bubbly on top.]</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Egg white variation:</i> Let\u2019s say you have a human, small or large, in your household that doesn\u2019t like egg yolks.
