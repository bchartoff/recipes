Provolone comes softer (less aged, more typical on sandwiches) and more firm (aged, with a sharper saltier flavor). I used an aged provolone; if doing so, I recommend starting with half the recommended cheese so it doesn\u2019t overwhelm. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have or be somewhere that you can readily purchase Sicilian oregano, it is absolutely amazing here. Finally, Silverton calls for a small head of iceberg, but when I used one, I found there to be more dressing than needed. I\u2019d instead recommend a larger head of iceberg, or holding back some vinaigrette to add only if needed.</p><p>By the way, almost every instance of this recipe I\u2019ve seen online and in print uses different quantities and size suggestions (1/2-inch wide ribbons vs. 1/4-inch, thin slices versus thick, small vs. large heads of lettuce, more or less chickpeas), which means you especially should feel free to adjust everything below to taste.
