And why did I peel them? Well, because the Lee Brothers do, because their mama always did. I\u2019d been so enamored with the skinless appeal of the tomatoes in last week\u2019s tomato and corn pie, I wanted to give them another spin. I liked the effect a lot, but like upmarket heirlooms, your salad will lack for nothing if you use skin-on and pedigree-free tomatoes.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 recipe Crispy Corn Bread (below) or 3 cups of 1-inch cornbread cubes", "1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes (4 to 6 medium)", "6 cups roughly torn sturdy fresh lettuce, such as Bibb, butter or Boston", "2 cups bitter greens, such as arugula or dandelion greens", "1 large Vidalia onion, trimmed, peeled, sliced crosswise as thinly as possible and separated into rings", "1 recipe Buttermilk-Lime Dressing (below)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 recipe Crispy Corn Bread (below) or 3 cups of 1-inch cornbread cubes<br/>\n1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes (4 to 6 medium)<br/>\n6 cups roughly torn sturdy fresh lettuce, such as Bibb, butter or Boston<br/>\n2 cups bitter greens, such as arugula or dandelion greens<br/>\n1 large Vidalia onion, trimmed, peeled, sliced crosswise as thinly as possible and separated into rings<br/>\n1 recipe Buttermilk-Lime Dressing (below)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 250\u00b0.
