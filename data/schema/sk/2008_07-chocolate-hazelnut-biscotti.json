I wish I could tell you how many recipes for biscotti I dug through before finding a couple that didn\u2019t have butter in them, but I\u2019m not sure I can even count that high. Suffice it to say, it took me to an article from 1993, a year that biscotti were all the rage but probably not for me as I was in \u2026 high school. (Sob.)</p><p>They are mildly sweet and chocolaty\u2013they\u2019re the exact opposite of a molten chocolate cake on the indulgent chocolate obsession sliding scale. They\u2019re also quite easy to put together if you promise to watch out for one thing: this is the stickiest dough I have ever worked with and you cannot have too much flour down on your surface.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["Total time: 1 hour", "Makes about 60 biscotti ", "1 cup whole hazelnuts, preferably blanched", "2 1/2 cups flour, plus flour for work surface", "1/2 cup Dutch-style cocoa powder", "1 tablespoon espresso powder", "Pinch of salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "4 large eggs", "1 1/3 cups sugar."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup whole hazelnuts, preferably blanched<br/>\n2 1/2 cups flour, plus flour for work surface<br/>\n1/2 cup Dutch-style cocoa powder<br/>\n1 tablespoon espresso powder<br/>\nPinch of salt<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br/>\n3/4 teaspoon baking powder<br/>\n4 large eggs<br/>\n1 1/3 cups sugar.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1.

Place in the oven and bake about 15 minutes, until firm to the touch. (This took me until 20 to 25 minutes.) Transfer to a cutting board and cut on an angle into slices one-half-inch thick. (I found that letting them cool for five minutes made this easier, as well as a sharp knife with a tight serrate.) Return the slices to the baking sheet, laying them on their cut sides, and return them to the oven. Bake another 20 minutes, until they are crisp and dry. Allow to cool completely before storing or serving.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07-chocolate-hazelnut-biscotti"}
