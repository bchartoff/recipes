If you like your lasagna on the very cheesy side (this is cheesy, but not heavily cheesy), you might increase the mozzarella to 1 1/2 pounds. I buy mozzarella that\u2019s been packaged tightly in plastic, not the kind in water, for baked pastas. For the 4 cups of diced vegetables, use what you can get or what you love. I got about 2 cups from 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms (that I further diced) and 2 cups diced fennel (from a medium bulb). I\u2019d definitely use peppers, zucchini, eggplant, or even broccoli here too.", "totalTime": "P0DT2H0M0S", "recipeYield": "8 to 12", "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons olive oil, divided", "1 large yellow onion, diced small", "4 cups small-diced (about 1/2-inch pieces) vegetables (see Note)", "5 ounces baby spinach or another green you like, roughly chopped", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "Red pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 6-ounce can tomato paste", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "Handful chopped fresh basil (optional)", "1 pound dried lasagna noodles (not no-boil type)", "1 pound (2 cups) whole milk ricotta", "1/4 cup heavy cream (optional)", "1 pound coarsely shredded low-moisture mozzarella", "1 cup (4 ounces) finely grated parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make your vegetable mixture: In a large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. The order you add your vegetables in has to do with what you\u2019re using, but you\u2019ll of course want to add the ones that take the longest to soften first. I cooked my onion and fennel together for 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned at the edges, then added the mushrooms and cooked them for 5 minutes, until they\u2019d softened and any liquid that was released had mostly cooked off. I added the spinach in the last minute, just letting it soften. Season each addition with salt and pepper for the best fully-developed flavor.

Add tomato paste (save the can) and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, don\u2019t worry if it seems to be drying out. Add two tomato paste cans of water (a total of 1 1/4 cups) and stir up any stuck bits, cooking until smooth. Add canned tomatoes, 1 teaspoon salt and basil, if you\u2019re using it.
