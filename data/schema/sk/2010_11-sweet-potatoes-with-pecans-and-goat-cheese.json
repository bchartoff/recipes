I used to do it the \u201cnormal\u201d way, tossing them with oil and then laying them out on a sheet but I always needed more and more oil and the pieces still stuck. Once I started generously oiling the pan, my vegetables started browning really well and didn\u2019t get weighed down \u2014 most of the oil stays on the roasting pan.</p><p>Wary of celery? Swap all or half with chopped radishes. Don\u2019t like goat cheese? Try ricotta salata or even blue cheese instead. Firmly believe that everything is improved by bacon? Crumble some in there, or use browned bits of pancetta. Don\u2019t like sweet potatoes? Skip them and added diced leftover turkey to the \u201csalad\u201d, with additional vinaigrette or just mayo.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 2 1/2", "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds sweet potato, scrubbed, unpeeled, in 3/4- to 1-inch coins", "4 tablespoons olive oil, divided", "1/4 cup toasted and cooled pecan halves", "2 tiny or 1 small shallot", "2 stalks celery", "2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley", "1 tablespoon dried cranberries or cherries (optional)", "2 ounces firmish goat cheese", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 teaspoons red wine vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon smooth Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 1/2 pounds sweet potato, scrubbed, unpeeled, in 3/4- to 1-inch coins<br/>\n4 tablespoons olive oil, divided<br/>\n1/4 cup toasted and cooled pecan halves<br/>\n2 tiny or 1 small shallot<br/>\n2 stalks celery<br/>\n2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley<br/>\n1 tablespoon dried cranberries or cherries (optional)<br/>\n2 ounces firmish goat cheese<br/>\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n2 teaspoons red wine vinegar<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon smooth Dijon mustard</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
