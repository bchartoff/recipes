Cut one clean 1/2-inch slice from the bottom and set it aside to garnish your drink later. Cut the skin off the rest of the pineapple in large strips, making sure to cut deep enough into the flesh to remove all of the skin. Quarter the pineapple and turn each quarter on its side. Remove the core from each quarter in one long cut. Cut the pineapple quarters into 1/2-inch slices. Cover a baking sheet or tray with plastic (makes for easier removal and no lost juice) and arrange pineapple chunks in one layer. Freeze until solid.
