Cook until the sugar is dark amber, 1 to 2 minutes (you can test this on an instant read thermometer, it\u2019s about 350 to 370 degrees F but read the Note up top first; a drop of caramel poured on a white plate will look dark amber).

The caramel will seize up a bit and will seem too thick to coat the apples, but it will loosen up in a minute. Cook, gently stirring and turning to ensure even cooking, until apples soften and begin to turn translucent at the edges and are about 3/4 of the way cooked through, about 10 minutes. This is not an exact science; larger or more dense apples may take longer. On the flipside, if your apples are falling into mush here, they\u2019re the wrong apples, it will not get better in the oven.

Arrange remaining apples in the center of the ring; it\u2019s far less noticeable if the center is more messily arranged. If you began with 8 apples, you\u2019ll probably find that you don\u2019t need all the pieces. Pour any extra caramel in the skillet over the apples.
