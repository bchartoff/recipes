It\u2019s almonds and citrus and tart jam and scraped vanilla bean, buttery and dense rather than the plush and pillowy, frosted and stacked American birthday cake. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less of a showstopper, just a little more grown-up in palette than, say, a certain equally-beloved chocolate peanut butter cake.</p><p>That said, things I might consider tweaking next time: First, the original recipe is for a six-layer cake, as is the recipe below. As the RSVPs for our party stacked up (I bet they heard I was baking cheesy poufs!) I worried it would not be enough, so I one-and-a-halved it into a nine-layer cake, which although it presented a great \u201cta-da!\u201d was not necessary. The cake is rich and dense, and the 6-layer height would have been enough.</p><p>Second, I wish the caramel flavor had come through better. Despite caramelizing some sugar and stirring in the jam, vanilla and a squeeze of lemon, the end product still tasted more like jam than anything else. Next time, I might play around with a 50% mixture of a deep, lightly-salted caramel sauce with 50% jam, so both flavors fall better into balance. The cream in a caramel sauce will help bring the flavor forward.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes one 8-inch, six-layer cake (increase quantities by 50% to create the nine-layer cake in these here pictures); serves (at least) 6 to 8", "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups sugar", "1 1/2 cups jam, raspberry, apricot, strawberry or peach are suggested, but I used currant jam, which I strained", "Half of a vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped", "Salt", "1/2 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 cup whole blanched almonds, toasted", "3 cups flour, sifted", "1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon", "Finely grated zest of 1 orange", "4 large egg yolks, at room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "1 teaspoon orange-flower water (I skipped this)", "1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 1/4 cups sugar<br/>\n1 1/2 cups jam, raspberry, apricot, strawberry or peach are suggested, but I used currant jam, which I strained<br/>\nHalf of a vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped<br/>\nSalt<br/>\n1/2 tablespoon lemon juice<br/>\n1 cup whole blanched almonds, toasted<br/>\n3 cups flour, sifted<br/>\n1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature<br/>\nFinely grated zest of 1 lemon<br/>\nFinely grated zest of 1 orange<br/>\n4 large egg yolks, at room temperature<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br/>\n1 teaspoon orange-flower water (I skipped this)<br/>\n1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Make the filling:</i> Place 1/4 cup of the sugar in a small saucepan.
