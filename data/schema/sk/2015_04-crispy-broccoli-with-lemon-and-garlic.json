Slice straight through the broccoli stem(s) as close to the crown of florets as possible. The crown should naturally break into several large florets, and you can cut these down into more manageable chunks. I find that less mess is made and less broccoli rubble is lost when I cut not <em>down</em> through the florets tops to halve chunks but <i>up</i> through the attached stems. (See 2nd photo above.) After cutting through the stem, I use my hands to break the floret the rest of the way in two. Don\u2019t let the stems go to waste. I peel off the tough outer skin and knots and cut the stems into 1/2-inch segments; they cook up wonderfully this way, and at the same speed as the florets.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Drizzle the first tablespoon of oil over your baking sheet or roasting pan and brush or roll it around so it\u2019s evenly coated.
