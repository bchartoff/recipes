I was crushed to learn a few years later that it had no butter \u2014 what kind of no-fun diet is that?! What are fruit butters? They\u2019re something between a jam and a sauce, with the flavor of jam but the smoothness of sauces. The good ones have the clear flavor of pate de fruits, but not the candy sweetness. They\u2019re also easy to make and as good slathered on a biscuit or piece of toast as they are stirred into your morning yogurt.</p><p>If you\u2019re looking for a traditional fruit butter, you\u2019ll be surprised by the moderate sweetness and clear peach flavor of this one. When I did some research on apple butters, I found that most recommend 4 cups of sugar for 4 pounds of fruit. I decided to take a leap \u2014 took a deep breath and nervously eyed the stove \u2014 and halved it. Most recommend one to two tablespoons of cinnamon and a bunch of other spices. I decided to use none. Humbly, I insist that these were two of the best kitchen decisions I\u2019ve made this week. Finally, I\u2019ve found a fruit butter that doesn\u2019t hit you first with sugar. It\u2019s just perfect, all peach with a enough tartness to remind you that it is, indeed, peach and not say peach gummy bears. And with no spices to clutter it up, you feel like you\u2019re getting the best of peach season in a format that will last until there\u2019s frost on the windowsills.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "4 cups", "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds (1.8 kilograms) peaches", "1 cup (237 ml) water", "2 cups (400 grams) granulated sugar", "Juice of one lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>4 pounds (1.8 kilograms) peaches<br/>\n1 cup (237 ml) water<br/>\n2 cups (400 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\nJuice of one lemon</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Without a food mill: Cut a small \u201cx\u201d in the bottom of each peach.

Others use a spoon; if the butter remains rounded on a spoon for two minutes, it is done.

Then, divide your hot piping hot peach butter between your jars, leaving a little room at the top. Wipe the rims clean with a dry towel and cover the jars with their lids. Submerge the jars in a large, deep pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, either in a removable basket or using tongs to dip and remove them. Let cool completely on towels, a process that can take overnight. If canned properly, the peach butter should last indefinitely at room temperature. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>I did not have canning jars around when I made this, but am so so <i>so</i> in love with it that I will be buying some and making more before the last peaches are gone.
