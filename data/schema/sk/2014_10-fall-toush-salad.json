However, because most big grocery stores don\u2019t carry it, it puts me in a position I generally try to avoid, which is sharing a recipe with an obscure ingredient. Here\u2019s the deal, though: If you don\u2019t have it, you\u2019ll be fine without it. Replace it with an equal amount of paprika (not a smoky one) and another squeeze of lemon if you so desire. You probably won\u2019t find anything to be missing because the salad has plenty of flavor without it. If you\u2019d like to seek some out, however, I consider it abundantly worth the $5 investment. You can buy it here, here, here or here (a new-ish spice shop on the Lower East Side), or likely any Middle Eastern market you can get to.
