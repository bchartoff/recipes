There are a zillion ways to do this, this is mine: I put them in a big bowl of very cold water for about 10 minutes. This encourages them to expel their sand. Scoop them out (not dump, if you dump the sandy water over them, it defeats the purpose) one by one and scrub them under running water. Most cultivated mussels have the <i>bissus</i> (beard) removed but if one lingers, yank it toward the hinge (if you do it away from the hinge, it can kill the mussel prematurely) or cut it with a knife. Discard <i>any</i> mussels with chipped shells or that are not completely shut; they are more than likely dead and it\u2019s not worth finding out if it may or may not make you sick, right?</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Boil your wine in a medium pot.

Twist off and discard one of the shells from each mussels (discard any that didn\u2019t open), making sure that the remaining shell contains the mussel. Reserve the mussel broth for another use. Mash butter, parsley, garlic, pimenton and salt to taste in a small bowl and slather each mussel with the compound butter. Arrange them in a broiler-safe tray and chill them in the fridge until the butter is hard.
