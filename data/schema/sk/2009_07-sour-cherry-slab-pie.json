Thus, if you\u2019re looking to use something besides sour cherries, you can swap in 6 cups of any other fruit. Adjust the sugar accordingly \u2014 you\u2019ll probably want less sugar with peaches or berries than you would with very sour cherries, or the same amount, if you like your pies on the sweeter side. (Remember, I kept this one very lightly sweetened.) Adjust the cornstarch accordingly too \u2014 peaches and berries usually let off more liquid than apples, but only slightly more than cherries.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>One other route you can take is to use the filling part of your favorite pie recipe, as most standard fruit pies contain 6 cups of berries or chopped fruit.
