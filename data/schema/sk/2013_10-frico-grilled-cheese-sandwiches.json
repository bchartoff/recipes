Grilled cheese? You think we need a recipe for cheese + bread + butter in a frying pan? But I won\u2019t to because making it this way changes everything. You can\u2019t be convinced by the aroma of buttery, toasting, crisping cheese in a hot skillet because you haven\u2019t made it yet, but I think that once you experience it \u2014 I mean, take a deep drag off the kitchen air and be so happy that you\u2019re home again \u2014 it will be what keeps you from making grilled cheese any other way again.</p><p>I like a hearty country wheat bread here, not too thickly sliced or it\u2019s hard for the cheese inside to melt. You may more or less cheese depending on the size of your bread slices, and your tastes.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "1 sandwich.

(I like to use a well-seasoned cast iron frying pan here.) Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cheese roughly in center of skillet. Place sandwich on top. Cook sandwich until golden underneath and cheese browns and crisps, about 2 to 4 minutes. Carefully lift melted (frico-ed) cheese and bread onto spatula, sprinkle remaining spoonful of cheese back in skillet, then flip sandwich over on top of it. Cook on second side until golden and crisp as well, pressing down on it with the spatula to encourage it to all come together. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Transfer to a plate, cut in half if desired, and dig in.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><em>Alternate riffs on the classic:</em> Are you a purist or do you like to put other things on your grilled cheese?
