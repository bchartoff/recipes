Maintaining as much air as possible in the dough, round each piece by pulling the dough together to form a pouch, stretching to make a smooth skin, and pinching it together where the edges meet.

If the dough is underrisen, it will puff up in the center instead of maintaining the characteristic hollow crater. The trick for underrisen dough is to make a small hole in the center before adding the filling. Since the dough bakes so quickly, it\u2019s easy to test bake one to see if the dough is ready. If you want to be on the safe side, make the hole anyway.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>4. <b>Make the onion-poppy seed filling.</b> In a small saute pan, heat the oil.
