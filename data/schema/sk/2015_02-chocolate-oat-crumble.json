I found three other versions of his chocolate-oat crisp online and none remotely matched. Some call for apricot, and cook it in elderflower syrup. Some have a more floury topping. I chose my favorite elements of each and mashed them up here. Feel free to tweak to your tastebuds\u2019 content (maybe some crystallized ginger in the lid?), with whatever fruit or sweeteners or cooking fats you\u2019d prefer. Just don\u2019t forget to eat it while it\u2019s still warm, and the chocolate is melty. </p><p>Note: This is a sloshy crumble, because there\u2019s no thickener in the base. We loved the fruit syrup over ice cream, but you can easily stir 1 to 2 tablespoons cornstarch before baking it to give it more body. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 3, maybe 4 if with ice cream", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Topping</u>", "1/3 cup (40 grams or 1 1/2 ounces) chopped dark chocolate", "1/2 cup (50 grams) rolled oats", "1/4 cup maple syrup", "Pinch of salt", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "3 tablespoons (40 grams) butter", "3 tablespoons (40 grams) sugar", "2 pears, peeled, halved, cored and diced into small chunks (I used firm D\u2019Anjous; cooking times for other varieties will vary)", "1 cup (115 grams or 4 ounces) raspberries "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling</u><br/>\n3 tablespoons (40 grams) butter<br/>\n3 tablespoons (40 grams) sugar<br/>\n2 pears, peeled, halved, cored and diced into small chunks (I used firm D\u2019Anjous; cooking times for other varieties will vary)<br/>\n1 cup (115 grams or 4 ounces) raspberries </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 350\u00b0F(180\u00b0C). </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a small dish, combine chocolate, oats, maple syrup and salt and set aside.

Add pear chunks and cook in this caramel-y syrup for 5 to 8 minutes, until slightly softened or half-cooked. (Bosc pears always take longer for me; ripe Bartletts, less.)
