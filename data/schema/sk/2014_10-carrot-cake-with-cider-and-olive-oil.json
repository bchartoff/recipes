I\u2019ve dropped the apple cider from the original 1 1/4 cups to 1 cup and the carrots (which I believe were the weighty culprit, as I was greedy to stuff this cake with almost an excess of them) from 2 cups to 1 1/2. My most recent loaf baked up wonderfully. I\u2019m so sorry that some of you got off on the wrong foot with this cake. I hope this cures it, and gives this cake a chance to be your favorite again. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/3 cups (290 grams) all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon (5 grams) table or fine sea salt", "2 teaspoons (10 grams) baking powder (I prefer aluminum-free)", "1 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground or a bunch of gratings of whole nutmeg", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 cup (120 ml) olive oil", "3/4 cup (145 grams) dark brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 cup cider (235 ml, see buying suggestions below)", "1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups packed coarsely grated carrots from about 9 ounces (2 to 2 1/2 meaty/large or 4 to 5 slim; about 255 grams) whole carrots", "Olive oil or nonstick cooking spray for baking pan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2 1/3 cups (290 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n3/4 teaspoon (5 grams) table or fine sea salt<br/>\n2 teaspoons (10 grams) baking powder (I prefer aluminum-free)<br/>\n1 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon ground or a bunch of gratings of whole nutmeg<br/>\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves<br/>\n1/2 cup (120 ml) olive oil<br/>\n3/4 cup (145 grams) dark brown sugar<br/>\n2 large eggs<br/>\n1 cup cider (235 ml, see buying suggestions below)<br/>\n1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract<br/>\n1 1/2 cups packed coarsely grated carrots from about 9 ounces (2 to 2 1/2 meaty/large or 4 to 5 slim; about 255 grams) whole carrots<br/>\nOlive oil or nonstick cooking spray for baking pan</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 350 degrees.
