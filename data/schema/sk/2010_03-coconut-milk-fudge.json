Nervous about the gooey/sweet factor, I played around a little, using unsweetened coconut milk (the recipe didn\u2019t specify, so I used what I thought would work) and then salted butter (honestly, by accident, but that pinch of salt really helped keep the treat on this side of treacly).</p><p>These candies are infinitely tweakable. Personally, I think they\u2019d be fantastic with a pinch of cinnamon, Mexican or otherwise. My mother wanted to try them with a drop or two of almond extract. I think vanilla could work well in there, too. And you can roll them in the suggested toppings \u2014 coconut, pistachios and sprinkles \u2014 or use your own.
