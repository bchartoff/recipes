The original recipe yields a persnickety 14, calls for superfine sugar and pastry flour; my adjusted recipe makes an even dozen with the ingredients you already have around, plus some much-needed salt. It\u2019s also all mixed by hand in one bowl in under 5 minutes. I made one round with cocoa powder instead of flour, because, you know, gluten. While I would never not eat them, I was sad to find that they lost their shiny lid, which was less crisp too. Do know that the swap works, but if flour isn\u2019t an issue for you, please keep it in there. I also made a batch with 2 tablespoons less sugar and we found them more enjoyably bittersweet; feel free to do the same if that\u2019s your preference. These contain an unconscionable amount of butter and we shouldn\u2019t question it; this isn\u2019t the time for it. Someone is going to ask me if they can frost these. You may not. These are such a perfect self-contained luxury, save the frosting for some arid sheet cake that needs it. If you serve it with anything, my suggestion would be a dollop of barely sweetened whipped cream, a dusting of powdered sugar and/or some berries.", "recipeIngredient": ["7 ounces (200 grams) bittersweet chocolate (70 or 72%), roughly chopped", "7 ounces (200 grams or 14 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into chunks", "1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "4 large eggs", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (20 grams) all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>7 ounces (200 grams) bittersweet chocolate (70 or 72%), roughly chopped<br/>\n7 ounces (200 grams or 14 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into chunks<br/>\n1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt<br/>\n4 large eggs<br/>\n2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (20 grams) all-purpose flour</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl.
