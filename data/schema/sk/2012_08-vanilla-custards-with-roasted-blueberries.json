You can also pour it into serving dishes or ramekins still hot, but you should then press a film of plastic wrap against each custard in the fridge so it doesn\u2019t form a pudding skin. Custards keep in fridge for up to 4 days.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To serve: Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Place blueberries in a heatproof, shallow roasting dish and sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar. Roast in oven for 12 to 15 minutes, rolling around once or twice during cooking time to ensure they roast evenly. The goal is not to let the blueberries fully slump or turn to sauce; you just want a little trickle of juices puddled across in the bottom. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice over berries the second they come out of the oven and roll them back and forth to evenly incorporate it. Spoon hot roasted blueberries and some of their juices over each custard. Eat immediately, passing any extra roasted blueberries alongside.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/08-vanilla-custards-with-roasted-blueberries"}
