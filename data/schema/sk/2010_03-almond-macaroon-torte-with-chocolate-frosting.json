I\u2019ve always made macaroons and meringues on sheets of parchment paper that were <i>not</i> sprayed or grease, the nonstick properties of parchment were enough to release the cookies. But this recipe has you use nonstick spray on them, which encourages your neat rectangles of macaroon to slide and spread. This is not ideal. I hope to update this step soon with a note about whether you can get by without the spray oil, using plain parchment. Fortunately, any spreading can be trimmed but more ideal would, of course, be no spreading at all. <i>Update:</i> At least one commenter (thank you Kate!) made these without oiling the parchment, found that the macaroons spread less and had no trouble removing the macaroons from the parchment. </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/03-almond-macaroon-torte-with-chocolate-frosting"}
