Once you accept that the first one always goes in the trash, that things are really much easier with a non-stick pan (I use this one; it\u2019s my only nonstick these days and it is worth its weigh in gold) and if you struggle with crepe-flipping, try to embrace my weirdo two-spatula crepe-flipping technique, described below, you will hit your stride and wonder why you don\u2019t make crepes more often. And you should, they keep fantastically well in the fridge, for a few days, even. They reheat well. They never stick to each other so you can just stack them up, no fancy separators required.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "11 to 12 9-inch crepes, or a 1 1/2-inch cake", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Banana crepes</u>", "4 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled slightly, plus extra for greasing pan", "1 large (will weigh 6 ounces/170 grams be about 6 inches long when unpeeled) speckly ripe banana (should yield a scant 1/2 cup peeled, pureed)", "1 cup (235 ml) milk", "3/4 cup (95 grams) all-purpose flour", "4 large eggs", "2 tablespoons (25 grams) light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon table salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "Pinch of ground cloves", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Cream cheese yogurt filling</u>", "8 ounces (225 grams) cream cheese, well-softened", "1 1/2 cups (345 grams) plain Greek-style yogurt", "1/3 cup (65 grams) granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "RECIPE_SUBHED__3<u>Walnut butterscotch topping</u>", "1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy whipping cream", "1/4 cup (50 grams) packed dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon (15 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/2 cup (about 50 grams) chopped walnuts, toasted", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Walnut butterscotch topping</u><br/>\n1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy whipping cream<br/>\n1/4 cup (50 grams) packed dark brown sugar<br/>\n1 tablespoon (15 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br/>\n1/2 cup (about 50 grams) chopped walnuts, toasted<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt, or to taste</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Make the crepe batter:</i> Blend banana in a food processor until totally smooth.

Flip* the crepe and cook it for 30 seconds on the other side, before transferring it to a plate to cool. Repeat with remaining batter. You can stack your crepes and they should not stick together.

I slide the larger one just a little bit under the crepe and lift it enough that I can slide the smaller one under. I lift it enough that I can get the larger one <i>far</i> underneath the crepe, then use the larger one alone to flip it. It makes it very easy, I promise.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Make filling:</i> Whip cream cheese until fluffy, then beat in yogurt, 1/2 cup at a time.

You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when it becomes thick and smells toasty. Stir in the vanilla and salt, then walnuts. Immediately pour over stack of filled crepes, nudging the butterscotch to the edges with your spoon \u2014 if it goes over the edge, so be it.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Serve immediately, or keep in fridge until ready to serve.
