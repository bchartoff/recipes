Honestly uninterested in seeking out fresh yeast, I looked up an exchange with it for instant yeast \u2014 it was said to be 3:1, and that the equivalent amount of instant yeast would be 1/4 teaspoon. In the end, I felt that this was too little. Everything took forever to rise and even though the rolls were tasty, they had a density I associate with bread that has not risen as much as it should. Thus, I\u2019ve suggested doubling the yeast, an amount that seems more in par with what you\u2019d see in a bread dough based on two cups of flour.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>** Next time, I will add the roasted chopped garlic into the dough in the mixer, before the first rise.
