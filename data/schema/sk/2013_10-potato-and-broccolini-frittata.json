The recipe calls for broccolini, a variety of broccoli with thinner, longer stalks and smaller florets that keeps a dark rich green color after it is cooked. (aka Baby Broccoli, Broccolette; read more here.) However, I think any number of green vegetables would work here, either standard broccoli florets or sauteed kale, etc. What I wouldn\u2019t skimp on is the parmesan. I know there\u2019s a lot, in fact, if you must, skip the half the goes inside the frittata, but don\u2019t skip the broiled part. That\u2019s the salty/crunchy/frico finish and Monday night dinners would be so much more dull without it.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["8 to 10 small waxy potatoes (about 1 ounce each), scrubbed and quartered", "1 cup vegetable or another broth; just use salted water if you don\u2019t have it around", "1/4 cup olive oil", "8 ounces (usually 1 bundle) broccolini, trimmed and halved lengthwise or chopped into 1-inch pieces", "1 small red or white onion, thinly sliced", "8 large eggs", "1 cup (about 3 to 3 1/2 ouncesgrated Parmesan cheese", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>8 to 10 small waxy potatoes (about 1 ounce each), scrubbed and quartered<br/>\n1 cup vegetable or another broth; just use salted water if you don\u2019t have it around<br/>\n1/4 cup olive oil<br/>\n8 ounces (usually 1 bundle) broccolini, trimmed and halved lengthwise or chopped into 1-inch pieces<br/>\n1 small red or white onion, thinly sliced<br/>\n8 large eggs<br/>\n1 cup (about 3 to 3 1/2 ouncesgrated Parmesan cheese<br/>\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place the potatoes and broth in a large, ovenproof frying pan, ideally one that is 12 inches.
