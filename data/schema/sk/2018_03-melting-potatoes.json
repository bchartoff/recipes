But I\u2019m reading here that floury/mealy potatoes (such as Russets) are often called for too. I haven\u2019t tested it with them, so if you try them, let us know. I imagine they\u2019d absorbed the broth even more luxuriously. I used all butter but I have read that olive oil with a little butter to finish, and/or clarified butter are equally popular, and less prone to burning. But I don\u2019t think you should skimp on the fat. If you do, you\u2019re going to eat roasted potatoes with broth, basically, and not roasted potatoes in a reduction of deeply browned butter and concentrated stock infused with herbs and garlic and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re still reading this.
