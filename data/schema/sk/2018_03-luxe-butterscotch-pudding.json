But, if you\u2019d like to doll it up, a great dollop of whipped cream (barely sweetened and a little tangy, please) and/or a puddle of salted caramel, Mozza-style, on top are sure wins. Further ways to amp it up: You can brown that butter before you add it at the end, and you can use some scrapings from a vanilla bean (no need to sacrifice a whole one; 1/4 of a bean will take you far here) in the milk portion too (giving it a chance to warm in the pudding vs. adding it at the end will help the flavor infuse).", "totalTime": "20 minutes plus cooling times", "recipeYield": "6 petite portions", "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup (125 grams) dark brown sugar [see Note]", "2/3 teaspoon (or a heaped 1/2 teaspoon) kosher salt", "1/4 cup (60 ml) water", "1 cup (235 ml) heavy cream", "1 cup (235 ml) milk (whole or lowfat work here)", "2 tablespoons (15 grams) cornstarch", "2 large egg yolks", "1 large egg", "3 tablespoons (45 grams) unsalted butter", "1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) vanilla extract", "1 to 2 teaspoons rum (optional)", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (125 grams) granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons (30 ml) water", "2 tablespoons (30 grams) salted or unsalted butter", "1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream", "Flaky sea salt, to taste", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "Sugar, to taste, if desired", "2 tablespoons creme fraiche or sour cream (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": ""}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2018/03-luxe-butterscotch-pudding"}
