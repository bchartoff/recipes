I make it with fresh rosemary and ricotta, but other herbs and cheese would work here, such as thyme or blue cheese. The only pesky part of this recipe is that I find that the roasting time really varies. What you\u2019re looking for is for the grapes to soften and get leaky \u2014 this can take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes depending on how firm/juicy your grapes are (softer ones take less time). I have also seen many references to grapes roasting and bursting in 10 minutes in other recipes, but have never experienced this in my oven. Once these juices muddle with the herbs and briny roasted olives, it\u2019s all unquestionably worth it. Don\u2019t forget to spoon any messy pan juices over the toasts.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "12 crostini, a very small batch.
