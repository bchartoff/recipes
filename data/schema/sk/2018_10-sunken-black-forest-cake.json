However, in the Buvette, the recipe has more butter and sugar; in Turshen\u2019s book, it has less. When I tested it, my happy place was in the middle \u2014 too little sugar and the cake was dry, too much and the sweetness of the preserves overwhelm \u2014 and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve shared below. The kirsh in the cherries both loosens them and gives them a little kick. If you don\u2019t have it, try light rum. If you don\u2019t use either, try a tablespoon each of lemon juice and water.", "totalTime": "2hr 30mins", "recipeYield": "8 to 12", "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons (170 grams or 6 ounces) unsalted butter, cubed", "12 ounces semi- or bittersweet chocolate chips (2 cups), or chopped chocolate", "6 large eggs, separated", "1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, distilled white vinegar, or apple cider vinegar", "3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar, divided", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar, or more to taste", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/2 cup sour or regular cherry preserves", "2 tablespoons kirsch (sour cherry brandy, optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat butter and chocolate together until about 75% melted in the microwave or over the lowest heat in a saucepan.
