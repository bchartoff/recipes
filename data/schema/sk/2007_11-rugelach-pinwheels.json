A-yee. These rugelach use the same exact dough and ingredients, but save you some time by allowing you to roll it into two large logs which can be sliced and baked as needed. Plus, they\u2019re pretty as hell. In the holiday season, I like to make a few logs and keep them in the freezer until needed. Let them warm up at room temperature for 30 minutes for easiest slicing. </p><p>Although apricot jam, raisins and walnuts are traditional, this doesn\u2019t mean that any other jam, dried fruit or nut couldn\u2019t be used as a replacement. We\u2019ve used dried tart cherries instead of raisins because my husband hates raisins so much that I am certain one kicked him or something in a past life. We\u2019ve also used dried currants, which were so tiny they required no additional chopping, and we\u2019ve also swapped half with mini chocolate chips, to please the chocolate obsessives in the house.</p><p>New notes, added 12/22/14: Additional tips to help with rolling, slicing, cooling and restoring shape after baked, if needed. I found that only half of the final cinnamon-sugar was needed for dipping, and have adjusted below accordingly. </p><p>New note, 12/17: I found many ways to streamline and quicken the process of making rugelach dough. Those tips work here for the dough assembly (namely, no softening needed if you have a food processor).
