Use a serrated knife to level the top, removing any dome so that the next layer will rest neatly on top. Thickly spread about 1/3 of frosting on the bottom layer, then transfer the cake to the freezer for just 5 or 10 minutes, to firm up the filling. Place the second cake layer on top of the filling. Trim the top again until level (if desired; seeing as you\u2019re not adding another layer, it would be for a neat appearance, not for cake stability). If the sides don\u2019t align perfectly with the bottom layer, you can trim them until straight as well. Thinly apply a coat of frosting over entire exterior of cake. Once again, you can get this to \u201cset\u201d quickly by sliding the cake into the freezer for 5 minutes. One set, add your final coat of frosting, a thicker more decorative one. (This is of course where you can add any decorations desired. You should have plenty of leftover frosting to go to town with.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Remove bits of waxed paper and serve with a big \u201cta-da!\u201d Should any survive the party, this cake keeps exceptionally well in the fridge.
