If you\u2019re of the misconception, as I was, that cream cheese frosting has no place at the breakfast meal, I think this will change your mind: softened cream cheese is beaten with just a fraction of the sugar you\u2019d use in a real frosting, and milk, not cream, is used as a thinning agent. Despite concerted dolloping efforts, we had a bit of extra and should you, as well, I advise you to definitely not try to figure out whether it would taste good on banana bread, or an oatmeal muffin, or a\u2026 spoon. Just don\u2019t. It\u2019s a slippery slope.</p><p>The second update is that I start with half the buttermilk these days \u2014 1/2 cup instead of the 1 cup in the original recipe.

If your pancake batter ends up too stiff for your liking, you can always add a little bit extra before cooking them, as noted.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "About 12 to 16 3- to 4-inch pancakes", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Pancakes</u>", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon table salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (I used a smidge less)", "1/8 teaspoon ground ginger", "2 tablespoons chopped walnuts (optional, I skip them)", "2 tablespoons golden raisins (optional, ditto)", "1 large egg", "2 tablespoons packed brown sugar", "1/2 cup buttermilk, plus more if needed (updated, see note)", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "2 cups finely grated carrots (from about a 3/4 pound bundle whole carrots)", "3 tablespoons butter, for griddle", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Cream cheese topping</u>", "4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature", "1/4 cup powdered sugar", "2 to 3 tablespoons milk", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "Dash of ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Cream cheese topping</u><br/>\n4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature<br/>\n1/4 cup powdered sugar<br/>\n2 to 3 tablespoons milk<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>\nDash of ground cinnamon</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place a rack in the upper third of your oven and preheat to 200\u00b0F.

Check your batter; if it seems too thick to you (although I like a thicker batter because it spills less in the pan), add a splash or two of extra buttermilk, as needed. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons batter into the hot pan per pancake (to me, this seemed like too little but after experimenting with larger pancakes, I advise you to listen to Joy; it\u2019s nice in small puddles), flipping once, until pancakes are golden on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer finished pancakes to a serving dish or tray in the oven, to keep warm while you repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter as needed.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Serve warm with cream cheese topping. </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/03-carrot-cake-pancakes"}
