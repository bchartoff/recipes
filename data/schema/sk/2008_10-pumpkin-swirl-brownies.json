Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-inch square baking pan or dish.  Cut a length of parchment that will cover the bottom and two sides (makes it much easier to remove), and line the pan with it. Butter the lining as well. (Deb note: I used an 8-inch square, because it was what I had. It works, too, but the brownies are crazy thick and take much longer to bake, just to give you a heads-up.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2.
