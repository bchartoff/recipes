There\u2019s something more caramelized and fermented in the fish sauce that you\u2019d miss.

A thermometer inserted into the thigh/leg joint should register 180 to 185 degrees if you\u2019re following Proper Chicken Cooking Protocol, or 170 to 175 degrees, if you\u2019re me, and have very specific chicken-cooking preferences despite what food safety experts advise. I like to live on the edge, obviously. Another classic, though less precise way, to see if chicken is cooked through is to pierce it with a knife. If the juices that run out are clear, your chicken should be just right.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/07-thai-style-chicken-legs"}
