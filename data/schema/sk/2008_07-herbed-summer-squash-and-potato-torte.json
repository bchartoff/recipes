In fact, it\u2019s even better reheated because there is something about potatoes that have been cooked twice\u2013they getting browner at the edges and more tender inside, creating an excellent contrast.</p><p>New note, 5/31/12: Just wanted to let you know that I made this the other night with the season\u2019s first summer squash as a single torte in a 10-inch cast iron skillet. I created 4 layers of potatoes and 3 of the squash and it was a bit tall going into the oven, almost overflowing, but it absolutely bakes down into a lovely height. I recommend lightly buttering or oiling your foil if you use this method, so that it doesn\u2019t stick to the top layer of potatoes before they shrink down. It needed about 10 minutes more baking time to get tender. Just like the original, we liked it even more reheated on day two (and three). But I think I will make it this way for now on because it felt simpler and heartier. It\u2019s been a side dish for us for three nights.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes 8 servings", "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced", "1 cup grated Parmesan cheese", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1/8-inch-thick rounds", "12 ounces yellow crookneck squash or regular yellow or green summer squash, cut into 1/8-inch-thick rounds", "6 teaspoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced<br/>\n1 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br/>\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br/>\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves<br/>\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br/>\n3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper<br/>\n2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1/8-inch-thick rounds<br/>\n12 ounces yellow crookneck squash or regular yellow or green summer squash, cut into 1/8-inch-thick rounds<br/>\n6 teaspoons olive oil</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.
