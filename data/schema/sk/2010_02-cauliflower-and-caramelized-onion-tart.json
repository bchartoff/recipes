Sure, we had it for a Thursday night dinner with the largest and hopefully most artery-clearing pile of salad greens, ever, but something about it seems even better suited for a Ladies Lunch, a brunch or a shower of some sort. I think it\u2019s the truffles. Or the two types of cream. Or the three types of cheese. Or the 30-minute caramelized onions. But should you, would you on a Thursday night while watching 30 Rock and The Office grrWinterOlympics, it is somehow even more welcome, out of place in the best of ways.</p><p>I made a slew of changes, from long notes expounding on my innermost feelings about truffle oil (at the end, in case you were at the edge of your seat) to smaller adjustments (more oil for the roasted cauliflower, so it doesn\u2019t stick, as mine always does with less; less parmesan; a homemade crust if you\u2019re feeling it; and the insistence that black pepper is equally welcome as white in this dish; a couple adjusted cooking times) but found the recipe, at its base, to be a delight.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Yields 8 servings", "recipeIngredient": ["1 small head of cauliflower (about 1 pound) or 1 pound of a larger head of cauliflower, cut into 1-inch flowerets (Romanesco cauliflower, especially orange or green, would be a pretty substitute)", "3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon truffle oil or a few pinches of truffle salt (optional) (see Notes below)", "1 refrigerated pie crust or a homemade tart shell (recipe below)", "1 large onion, halved lenghtwise and thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "2 large eggs", "1 (7- to 8- ounce) container mascarpone cheese (see Note below for suggested substitutions)", "1/2 cup whipping cream (although any low- or full-fat milk or light cream will work as well)", "1/4 teaspoon ground white or black pepper", "Pinch of ground nutmeg", "1 cup grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese (Swiss or Comt\u00e9 are great swaps)", "1/3 cup Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 small head of cauliflower (about 1 pound) or 1 pound of a larger head of cauliflower, cut into 1-inch flowerets (Romanesco cauliflower, especially orange or green, would be a pretty substitute)<br/>\n3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil<br/>\n1 tablespoon truffle oil or a few pinches of truffle salt (optional) (see Notes below)<br/>\n1 refrigerated pie crust or a homemade tart shell (recipe below)<br/>\n1 large onion, halved lenghtwise and thinly sliced<br/>\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br/>\n2 large eggs<br/>\n1 (7- to 8- ounce) container mascarpone cheese (see Note below for suggested substitutions)<br/>\n1/2 cup whipping cream (although any low- or full-fat milk or light cream will work as well)<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon ground white or black pepper<br/>\nPinch of ground nutmeg<br/>\n1 cup grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese (Swiss or Comt\u00e9 are great swaps)<br/>\n1/3 cup Parmesan cheese</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.
