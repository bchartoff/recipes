[Update 1/29: Based on the comments I\u2019m reading, I\u2019m going to red card the use of natural or non-Dutched cocoa for now as the folks using this kind seem to be the ones having the most trouble with their cookies falling apart. So sorry for the trouble; it just seems most reliable to use this recipe with Dutched cocoa. Also, it is tastier.] Technically speaking, baking soda and Dutched cocoa powder don\u2019t react, but I found that it imparted a slight raised texture and better crumb than skipping it or using baking powder, so I kept it there. Besides changing the type of cocoa powder and decreasing the baking soda, I also adjusted the recipe by adding an egg yolk (so it would come together), giving you the option to grind, instead of grating the chocolate (a step I find pesky because my warm hands make a mess of it) and then, because the Balthazar cookie I fell in love with is so bittersweet, giving you a suggested reduced sugar amount. If you\u2019d like a bittersweet chocolate cookie, use the 1/2 cup amount. If you\u2019d like a sweeter (although hardly overly sweet) chocolate cookie, use 2/3 cup. I always sprinkle these with coarse brown sugar, but I\u2019m sure they could be prettied up with sprinkles or the like as well.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes 40 to 48 2-inch thin cookies, fewer if thicker", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup (30 grams) Dutched cocoa powder (see Updated Note)", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 cup (1 stick, 4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/2 to 2/3 cup (100 to 135 grams) granulated sugar (less for a more bittersweet cookie)", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large egg yolk", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) semi- or bittersweet chocolate, grated or finely chopped until almost powdery in a food processor", "Coarse sugar (turbinato/sugar in the raw or decorative) for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1/3 cup (30 grams) Dutched cocoa powder (see Updated Note)<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br/>\n1/2 cup (1 stick, 4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br/>\n1/2 to 2/3 cup (100 to 135 grams) granulated sugar (less for a more bittersweet cookie)<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt<br/>\n1 large egg yolk<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>\n3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) semi- or bittersweet chocolate, grated or finely chopped until almost powdery in a food processor<br/>\nCoarse sugar (turbinato/sugar in the raw or decorative) for sprinkling</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Sift together the flour, cocoa and baking soda together onto a piece of waxed paper or into a bowl and set aside.
