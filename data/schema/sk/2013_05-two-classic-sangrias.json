It\u2019s the little black dress/white oxford of sangrias. Susan Spungen recommends trying it with white wine instead of red in the summer, and adding peaches or berries too. The second is the one we fell in love with at a small restaurant in our neighborhood. It\u2019s much less sweet (it has barely a pinch of sugar in it, though you can add more), and tastes mostly of wine, with a little pep from fizz, and it makes a whole lot. Rose is added to lighten the mixture. The chef, Rafael Mateo, recommends you let it \u201cknit\u201d together overnight, and only adding the fruit to each glass to serve.", "recipeIngredient": ["<b>Classic Sangria</b>", "From Susan Spungen\u2019s ", "<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579653685/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1579653685&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=smitten-20\">What\u2019s a Hostess To Do?</a>", "1 bottle dry red wine", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1/4 cup brandy", "1/4 cup Triple sec or another orange liqueur", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice", "Sliced peaches, apples, oranges or berries, tossed with a squeeze of lemon juice", "Sparkling water, if desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 bottle dry red wine<br/>\n1 tablespoon sugar<br/>\n1/4 cup brandy<br/>\n1/4 cup Triple sec or another orange liqueur<br/>\n1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice<br/>\nSliced peaches, apples, oranges or berries, tossed with a squeeze of lemon juice<br/>\nSparkling water, if desired</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Mix the wine, sugar, brandy, liqueur and orange juice in a large pitcher.
