This would logically be where I tell you just to use your own favorite pie crust (or mine) but the resulting crust is quite delicious if you feel you\u2019re up for it. I use \u201ccheat\u201d method of blind-baking crusts (freezing, foiling, skipping the weights) and suggest this instead below."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "\u2013 The custard is fantastic but I made it the \u201cquick\u201d (one pot, no tempering) way the second time and it worked just fine, so I\u2019m encouraging you to do the same. The recipe calls for a full vanilla bean and I know they\u2019re wildly expensive right now. If you keep a jar of vanilla sugar around, I vote for using it here instead of granulated along with 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. If you don\u2019t keep vanilla sugar around, promise you will after the next time you use a bean, okay? Vanilla paste will work here as well. Finally, the rum is my addition (Deb is gonna Deb, etc.) but I keep it very low because you will really really taste it if you use more; I find when you use more than a tablespoon in a custard, it becomes a rum custard and nothing else. Again, coconut is the star here."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "\u2013 The amount of whipped cream on top is borderline staggering to a coconut cream pie newbie and exactly correct to everyone who has eaten it before; it\u2019s a thing, it\u2019s the way it should be.

I learned this the hard way, when packed the 1/2 cup of coconut down, the weight clocked in twice as high, and the crust went right into the garbage because it absolutely didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m going to file this ingredient onto a long list of things that just work so much better when weighed (see also: dried coconut flakes, sliced almonds, ground nut flours, raspberries with the hollow centers that collapse when ripen, grated cheese, okay I could go on forever)\n"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2018/04-triple-coconut-cream-pie"}
