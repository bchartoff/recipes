I use a vegetable peeler these days to make (prettier) ribbons of zucchini instead. This works best with thinner zucchini or summer squash. 2, I use a bit less arugula these days, maybe 3 to 4 ounces, instead. I love arugula, but prefer to let the zucchini star. 3, Finally, but perhaps you already know this: you needn\u2019t follow the measurements, although they work perfectly well, precisely here. Season to taste, oil to taste, lemon to taste, parmesan to taste, and you\u2019ll have something perfectly delicious.", "totalTime": "P0DT0H35M0S", "recipeYield": "4 as a main, 6 as a side", "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pound zucchini (about 3 large) or a mix of thin summer squash", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 pound arugula, stems discarded and leaves cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips (6 cups), or baby arugula", "1 ounce parmesan, coarsely grated (on large holes of a box grater; about 1/2 cup) or shaved with a vegetable peeler", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "Juice of one lemon", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "You can either cut zucchini crosswise into paper-thin slices with an adjustable-blade slicer, or use a vegetable peeler (this works best if zucchini are thin, thinner than the length of the peeler blade) to shave the zucchini lenghtwise into long ribbons.
