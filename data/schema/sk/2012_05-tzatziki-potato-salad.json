You just make it as often as you can and sometimes cold, boiled potatoes find their way in and those days, you get to call it lunch. </p><p>* Three whole days before having a baby. Why was I cooking? Really, you should have had a talk with me about that.</p><p>Here\u2019s what I love about this salad, aside from the fact that it\u2019s a cinch to make: it\u2019s cool and refreshing while so many potato salads are full of heft \u2014 the the cucumber-dill-yogurt-lemon-garlic thing is like an edible air-conditioner.

Drain potatoes and let them cool completely. (This is a great step to do ahead, as it seems to take potatoes forever to cool. If you\u2019re really in a rush, spread them on a tray and pop them in the freezer for 10 minutes.) </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Meanwhile, in the bottom of a large bowl, stir together yogurt, sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar, dill, garlic, salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Grate the cucumber on a box grater (or in your food processor\u2019s shredding blade, if you like to get things done in one hundredth of the time) and try to remove some of the excess by squeezing out handfuls, pressing it in a mesh sieve with a spoon or wringing it in a square of cheesecloth or a lint-free dishtowel.
