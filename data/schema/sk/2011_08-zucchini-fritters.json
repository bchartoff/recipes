Wring out the zucchini in one of the following ways: pressing it against the holes of a colander with a wooden spoon to extract the water, squeezing out small handfuls at a time, or wrapping it up in a clean dishtowel or piece of cheese cloth and wringing away. You\u2019ll be shocked (I was!) by the amount of liquid you\u2019ll lose, but this is a good thing as it will save the fritters from sogginess.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Return deflated mass of zucchini shreds to bowl.

Drop small bunches of the zucchini mixture onto the skillet only a few at a time so they don\u2019t become crowded and lightly nudge them flatter with the back of your spatula. Cook the fritters over moderately high heat until the edges underneath are golden, about 3 to 4 minutes. If you find this happening too quickly,  reduce the heat to medium. Flip the fritters and fry them on the other side until browned underneath again, about 2 to 3 minutes more. Drain briefly on paper towels then transfer to baking sheet and then into the warm oven until needed. Repeat process, keeping the pan well-oiled, with remaining batter. I like to make sure that the fritters have at least 10 minutes in the oven to finish setting and getting extra crisp.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>For the topping, if using, stir together the sour cream, lemon juice, zest, salt and garlic and adjust the flavors to your taste.
