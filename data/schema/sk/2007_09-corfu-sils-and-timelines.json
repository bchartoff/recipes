I can\u2019t tell you how many lemon yogurts I picked up at my totally yuppie gourmet grocery store before finding a single one with real, actual lemon in it and not artificial flavoring. I\u2019m not naming names, but there were brands that I really expected better from. I finally landed on Stoneybrook Farms low-fat with lemon puree on the bottom. Why I went through this trouble when I could have just, uh, squeeze lemon juice into a plain yogurt, I don\u2019t know. But just to warn that if you\u2019re going through the effort of making a cake from scratch, you might want to make sure your lemon yogurt is the real deal. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>** For some reason, this never happened for me. Well beyond the baking time (though my oven runs a little cool) the toothpick was still coming out with some damp crumbs attached while the top was golden and springy, so I took it out. It was cooked just fine in the center, so if this happens to you, don\u2019t worry. </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/09-corfu-sils-and-timelines"}
