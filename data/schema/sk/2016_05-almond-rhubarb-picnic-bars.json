If all of your rhubarb are pointing in the same direction when you cut them, that is, the greener bases on one side and the pinker tops on the other, and you work through the pieces from one side of the board to the other, a gentle transition of color happens on its own.

A serrated knife, used gently, can ensure the rhubarb stays perfectly put if it\u2019s not cold enough. While bars do not need to be refrigerated if it will just be a day or so, they keep longer and (I think) more nicely chilled.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/05-almond-rhubarb-picnic-bars"}
