If you\u2019re thinking, as I was, that there was no need for a parchment paper circle in the bottom (and later, top) of the pan, you can probably skip it. The \u201cprobably\u201d is there because I didn\u2019t get to retest this without it but see nothing to worry about; if a berry sticks, just scoop it and plop it on top of the cake. The cake itself is a little on the shortcake side \u2014 sturdier than your average plush layer cake but still quite moist. Still, if you want a more traditional upside-down cake base, I think this one is phenomenal (you might even swap the pineapple juice for white cranberry) as is this one.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter or cooking spray for the baking pan", "2/3 cup (5 ounces or 142 grams) packed light brown sugar", "12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks, 6 ounces or 171 grams) unsalted butter, melted", "1 tablespoon unsulphured molasses", "2 cups (8 1/2 ounces or 242 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 cup (7 ounces or 198 grams) sugar", "2 teaspoons (9 grams) baking powder", "1 teaspoon salt", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup (8 1/2 ounces or 242 grams) sour cream", "2 cups (8 ounces or 230 grams) fresh or frozen cranberries (you could add a half-cup more, if you, too, can never have enough cranberries)", "Optional flavorings: 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, 1 tablespoon orange or lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon zest, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, few gratings of fresh nutmeg or a combination thereof", "Whipped cream, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Unsalted butter or cooking spray for the baking pan<br/>\n2/3 cup (5 ounces or 142 grams) packed light brown sugar<br/>\n12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks, 6 ounces or 171 grams) unsalted butter, melted<br/>\n1 tablespoon unsulphured molasses<br/>\n2 cups (8 1/2 ounces or 242 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1 cup (7 ounces or 198 grams) sugar<br/>\n2 teaspoons (9 grams) baking powder<br/>\n1 teaspoon salt<br/>\n3 large eggs, at room temperature<br/>\n1 cup (8 1/2 ounces or 242 grams) sour cream<br/>\n2 cups (8 ounces or 230 grams) fresh or frozen cranberries (you could add a half-cup more, if you, too, can never have enough cranberries)<br/>\nOptional flavorings: 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, 1 tablespoon orange or lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon zest, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, few gratings of fresh nutmeg or a combination thereof<br/>\nWhipped cream, optional</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.

Please, <i>please</i> check yours on the early side. Remove from the oven and let cool in pan for 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around the inside of the pan then insert over a flat platter that is (Learn From My Mistakes Alert!) larger than your cake pan, to catch any puddling or jumping cranberries.
