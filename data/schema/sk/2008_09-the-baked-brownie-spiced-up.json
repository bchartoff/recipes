You see, my friend jotted down the recipe they were using back in the day for the chipotle brownie, so I could try it at home. But I lost it. For three years. And only found it recently, coicidentally, just a couple weeks before someone gave me a copy of the Baked cookbook. Which turned out to have their brownie recipe, improved over the years with more chocolate and more butter (thankyouverymuch) but no chipotle version. And I really had liked that chipotle version.</p><p>Below, I have cobbled together the spices from the older recipe with the current one so you can attempt an unofficial version of their very subtly spicy brownies. Not interested in spices? Just skip the chipotle, cardamom and cinnamon. Either way, welcome to your new brownie nirvana.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "24 brownies", "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups (155 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon (5 grams) table salt", "2 tablespoons (10 grams) dark unsweetened cocoa powder", "1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons chipotle powder (I didn\u2019t have this and used smoky spicy paprika, with a very similiar flavor profile, instead) (for the spicy version)", "3/4 teaspoon cinnamon (for the spicy version)", "1/4 teaspoon cardamom (for the spicy version)", "11 ounces (310 grams) dark chocolate (60 to 72% cacao), coarsely chopped", "1 cup (2 sticks, 8 ounces or 225 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon instant espresso powder", "1 1/2 cups (300 grams) granulated sugar", "1/2 cup (105 grams) firmly packed light brown sugar", "5 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons (10 ml) pure vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 1/4 cups (155 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1 teaspoon (5 grams) table salt<br/>\n2 tablespoons (10 grams) dark unsweetened cocoa powder<br/>\n1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons chipotle powder (I didn\u2019t have this and used smoky spicy paprika, with a very similiar flavor profile, instead) (for the spicy version)<br/>\n3/4 teaspoon cinnamon (for the spicy version)<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon cardamom (for the spicy version)<br/>\n11 ounces (310 grams) dark chocolate (60 to 72% cacao), coarsely chopped<br/>\n1 cup (2 sticks, 8 ounces or 225 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>\n1 teaspoon instant espresso powder<br/>\n1 1/2 cups (300 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\n1/2 cup (105 grams) firmly packed light brown sugar<br/>\n5 large eggs, at room temperature<br/>\n2 teaspoons (10 ml) pure vanilla extract</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
