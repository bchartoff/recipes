I added it on a whim, and we cannot get enough of the flavor. Just a little permeates the pickle mixture with a hint of celery, without actually using celery, which can get a little beige after pickling. This is a flexible recipe, however. You could add actual celery slices if you wish, red onion or a little red cabbage to create the ink pinky tangled look of the Russ and Daughter\u2019s version (which has only a pinch of carrot and pepper strips in it, and no cucumber). The carrots, cucumbers and peppers I use here are modeled after the Zabar\u2019s version.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "9 to 10 cups, which shrinks to 7 to 8 cups after pickling", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Brine</u>", "1 1/2 cups white vinegar", "1 1/2 cups water", "1/3 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon celery seed", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt* plus more to taste \u2003", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Salad</u>", "1 small head (2 pounds) green cabbage", "1 red bell pepper", "1 carrot (I used only 1/2 my very thick one)", "1 kirby cucumber"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Salad</u><br/>\n1 small head (2 pounds) green cabbage<br/>\n1 red bell pepper<br/>\n1 carrot (I used only 1/2 my very thick one)<br/>\n1 kirby cucumber</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Mix brine ingredients in the bottom of a medium bowl and set aside. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Prepare your vegetables: Trim and core cabbage and slice thinly with a knife, food processor slicing blade or adjustable-blade slicer.
