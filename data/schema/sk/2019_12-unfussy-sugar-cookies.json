What I like about them is that they crisp without being being unpleasantly crunchy or dry, and they hold shapes nicely when baked, and they don\u2019t forget the salt. The original recipe calls for salted butter; should you only have unsalted, add 1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt. However, the process (immediate roll out, no flour, etc.) is just the way I prefer to make \u2014 unfussy and very doable. The icing recipe makes enough to coat the cookies as shown, but you might need extra if your designs are thicker or more elaborate.", "totalTime": "P0DT2H0M0S", "recipeYield": "About 80 1.5-inch cookies", "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups (390 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt (if using unsalted butter only)", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar", "1 cup (8 ounces or 225 grams) salted or unsalted butter", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract", "1 large egg white, ideally pasteurized (or use meringue or egg white powder as per label instructions)", "1 1/4 cups (150 grams) powdered sugar", "Pinch of salt", "A few drops of a flavoring of your choice (optional) (lemon, almond, vanilla)", "Food coloring and sprinkles, as you wish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cookies in a food processor: Combine flour, salt (if butter is unsalted), baking powder, and sugar in a large bowl or the work bowl of your machine, whisking to combine well.

(The order here is different because the butter takes longer to soften, longer than we want to beat the flour for.) Cut butter into small cubes and add to the sugar mixture and beat with the paddle or beater attachments until the butter and sugar are an even, soft texture \u2014 you\u2019ll want to scrape down the bowl a few times and be patient, especially with a hand mixer, but once the two are combined, no need to beat further (until fluffy) as you would with other cookie recipes. Add egg and vanilla and beat until evenly combined, scraping down bowl. Add baking powder and beat it an additional 30 seconds beyond what is needed to make the baking powder disappear (we want to disperse it extremely well).

I am using these thick rulers to make rolling even slabs of dough really easy, but this is probably better, or you might just prefer rolling pin bands. If you don\u2019t want to use a raw, pasteurized egg white, meringue powder is a wonderful thing. I\u2019m using this pearly sanding sugar to decorate and can\u2019t find dragees as tiny as I have online (think: large poppy seeds) but I\u2019d buy these stars or this mixed sprinkle set in a heartbeat as an alternative.
