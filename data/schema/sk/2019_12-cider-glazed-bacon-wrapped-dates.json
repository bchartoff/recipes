Most thin bacon can be split in half to easily wrap two dates. You want to make sure that your bacon will wrap around each date twice before securing it with a toothpick as it will shrink a lot in the oven. Bigger or smaller dates will change the yield, too. I\u2019m using Trader Joe\u2019s today, for reference; each package has 14 slices and wraps 28 dates. I find bacon easier to work with cold from the fridge. If you can track down pitted dates, this fantastically easy recipe is even more so, but should you have no choice but to pit your own, it\u2019s not hard, just make a slit down the side of the date and you can pop the pit out.  If you\u2019d like to be fancy, this is really nice with some rosemary sprigs on the tray, roasted in the bacon drippings, cider vinegar, and salt.", "totalTime": "P0DT1H0M0S", "recipeYield": "Makes about 28 bites", "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces bacon (thinner is better), each strip cut into two segments", "6 ounces pitted dates (about 28)", "1 1/2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "2 teaspoons maple syrup or honey", "A few pinches aleppo-style mild red pepper flakes", "Flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Wind bacon around each date, securing it with a toothpick and arranging it on a rimmed, foil-lined baking sheet or roasting dish.

Brush or spoon over each bacon-wrapped date; you can even very briefly roll them in the mixture to coat. Sprinkle with sea salt.

Check in on the early end, and then every 5 minutes thereafter, to get the color and crisp just right.
