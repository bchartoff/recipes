Scrape the bowl down well and don\u2019t worry if the batter looks uneven. Place your flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a sifter (I find this step necessary because my cocoa is very lumpy) and shake it over the batter bowl.

That said, if you don\u2019t have Dutched but only a regular or natural cocoa, I haven\u2019t tested this cake with it but suspect that you\u2019ll be just fine, although the cake may be less dark in color.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><em>How I like to swirl frosting</em>: I always use a small offset spatula (have I convinced you to buy one yet?
