I made the dough in the food processor, because I already had it down and the Kitchen Aid seemed impossibly far away (on top of the fridge). I used the egg white leftover from the crust to make a shiny glaze for the tart. I used less jam than I was supposed to, because I ran out and was too lazy to get more and too apprehensive to mix jams; I liked this lesser amount in the end. Because my tart stuck to the pan just a little, I\u2019m suggesting that you butter your tart mold. Finally, I approached the top crust differently than suggested.  Rather than using thicker \u201ccoins\u201d of dough, I cut them super-thin and overlapped them to create a pretty lid. Because pretty counts. I am sure Mr. Lebovitz will approve.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups (210 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup (70 grams) stone-ground cornmeal or polenta", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "9 tablespoons (4 1/2 ounces or 130 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar", "1 large egg, whole", "1 large egg, separated", "1/8 teaspoon almond extract", "1 1/3 to 1 3/4 cups (450 grams) jam (see Note above; I used the smaller amount) or marmalade", "2 tablespoons (30 grams) coarse-crystal or granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 1/2 cups (210 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1/2 cup (70 grams) stone-ground cornmeal or polenta<br/>\n2 teaspoons baking powder<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon salt<br/>\n9 tablespoons (4 1/2 ounces or 130 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br/>\n1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\n1 large egg, whole<br/>\n1 large egg, separated<br/>\n1/8 teaspoon almond extract<br/>\n1 1/3 to 1 3/4 cups (450 grams) jam (see Note above; I used the smaller amount) or marmalade<br/>\n2 tablespoons (30 grams) coarse-crystal or granulated sugar</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt.
