They humbly call it \u201cThe Back Forty\u201d, but from the first night we had it I\u2019ve been calling it the Vemontucky Lemonade in honor of its maple syrup and bourbon and uh, clearly, I think I\u2019m pretty clever. (No need to play along at home). I also have far too much fun creating things from memory than to limit myself to pesky official recipes that I\u2019ve pestered from bartenders. Nevertheless, this is a glass of something dreamy. The bourbon and maple syrup give it a depth of flavor a lot of warm weather drinks lack, and the lemonade makes you wish you were out on a patio somewhere, watching a summer storm roll in. Fortunately, there\u2019s no need to wait for summer to start making a habit of this drink.", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (with an efficient squeezer, you should get this plus up to 1/3 cup extra from 2 pounds of 8 lemons)", "2 1/2 cups cold water, plus additional if needed", "1/4 to 1/2 cup maple syrup", "Bourbon", "Lots of ice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (with an efficient squeezer, you should get this plus up to 1/3 cup extra from 2 pounds of 8 lemons)<br/>\n2 1/2 cups cold water, plus additional if needed<br/>\n1/4 to 1/2 cup maple syrup<br/>\nBourbon<br/>\nLots of ice</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Mix lemon juice with 2 1/2 cups water and 1/4 cup maple syrup.
