For sesame seeds, you can do these in a skillet over low heat but you must watch it like a hawk and stir often because once they start picking up color, they go from golden to brown very quickly. This time I did it in a 350 degree oven, stirring every 5 minutes (I also go ahead and do the whole jar, so I have them for the next time). It took longer but the flavor was off the charts. When I ground the seeds, the whole apartment smelled nutty and wonderful. \nThe water in the omelet ribbons may sound odd, but I found the final texture of the eggs a bit softer and more apt to ribbon without breaking with it. If you\u2019d like, you can use mirin (sweet wine) instead of water, and skip the sugar.\nI love using soba (buckwheat) noodles here but ramen noodles are more traditional, and most rice noodles or rice \u201csticks\u201d are gluten-free. You can make this a vegan dish by omitting the egg ribbons.\n</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 for dinner", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Dressing</u>", "4 1/2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, plus more for garnish", "3 tablespoons water", "3 tablespoons soy sauce (use low-sodium for a less salty sauce)", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon tahini", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon  rice vinegar", "1 1/2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar, or more to taste", "Chili sesame oil to taste", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Omelet Ribbons</u>", "Neutral cooking oil, to coat skillet", "3 large eggs", "3 teaspoons water", "A few pinches sugar", "A few pinches salt", "RECIPE_SUBHED__3<u>Assembly</u>", "1 9.5-ounce package buckwheat soba noodles", "Raw vegetables of choice (we used julienned carrots, cucumbers and radishes, plus some snipped chives on top, which have recently reappeared in my garden!)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Assembly</u><br/>\n1 9.5-ounce package buckwheat soba noodles<br/>\nRaw vegetables of choice (we used julienned carrots, cucumbers and radishes, plus some snipped chives on top, which have recently reappeared in my garden!)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make the dressing:</u> Put the toasted sesame seeds into a blender or food processor and run the machine until the seeds look like wet sand \u2014 it will take a couple minutes.

Pour in 1/3 of mixture, which will be enough to coat the pan very thinly. (If your pan is bigger or smaller, use less or more accordingly per batch, the goal is to keep the egg very thin.)

The first smaller one goes under the edge and lifts the omelet/crepe enough that I can hold the second larger spatula in my other hand and slide it under enough that it goes past the center of the omelet/crepe. From here, it\u2019s easier to flip without tearing.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/03-sesame-soba-and-ribboned-omelet-salad"}
