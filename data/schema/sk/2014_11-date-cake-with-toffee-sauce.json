I only made a couple changes such as adding a little salt to the cake itself, and a little sea salt to the top of the sauce, which nicely contrasts the sweetness. The original recipe calls for a 10\u00d710-inch pan, which I have rarely seen and do not own. I used a 9\u00d713-inch instead, and needed much, much less baking time (yay). It makes for a slightly thinner cake, but also more servings. You could easily serve 12 to 20 people with this. You could also halve everything and bake it in an 8\u00d78-inch square pan.", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Cake</u>", "3/4 pound (12 ounces, 340 grams or about 2 1/4 cups) dried dates", "2 1/4 cups (530 ml) boiling water", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda", "8 tablespoons (1 stick, 4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, melted", "3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons (25 grams) light or dark brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1 2/3 cups (210 grams) all-purpose flour", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Sauce</u>", "8 tablespoons (1 stick, 4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, melted", "1 cup (235 ml) heavy or whipping cream", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (215 grams) brown sugar (light is called for, but I\u2019d like to use dark next time)", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "RECIPE_SUBHED__3<u>To serve</u>", "Unsweetened whipped cream (optional, but please don\u2019t skip it)", "A few flakes of sea salt", "Fresh mint leaves (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>To serve</u><br/>\nUnsweetened whipped cream (optional, but please don\u2019t skip it)<br/>\nA few flakes of sea salt<br/>\nFresh mint leaves (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Make the cake:</i> Pit and roughly chop dates and place them in a heatproof bowl.
