When using Russets, the smaller, the better, for maximum creaminess when roasted. As the potatoes roast, the butter in the pan browns and then goes a shade dark \u2014 it might smell worrisome, but it will taste wonderful. If you\u2019d prefer, however, you can replace half the butter with olive oil, which will reduce the darkening of the roasted sides. This recipe, uh, uses a lot of butter, possibly more than you need. I\u2019ve gotten away with using just 2/3 of it (4 tablespoons), but I don\u2019t usually bother limiting it. It seems the excess stays in the pan, and the potatoes have just enough to be buttery but not drenched.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 12", "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter", "8 small-medium baking potatoes (about 4 pounds), scrubbed", "16 fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves", "Coarse salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>3 ounces (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter<br/>\n8 small-medium baking potatoes (about 4 pounds), scrubbed<br/>\n16 fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves<br/>\nCoarse salt</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 450 degrees F.
