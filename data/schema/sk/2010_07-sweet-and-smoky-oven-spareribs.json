Sugar plays an important part in barbecue, in both flavor and caramelization, so I might be hesitant to dial it back by more than 1/4, but I would increase the salt, and possibly double it. Honestly, you can tweak the rub any which way (add cumin, black pepper or red pepper flakes, more paprike, more chile powder), there\u2019s no way these can come out badly. Last thought: If you\u2019ve got an oven thermometer, watch it instead of your temperature dial. I find that oven temperatures seem to be the most off at the lowest settings (my oven\u2019s \u201c200\u201d was pushing past 250 on the thermometer) and while you can cook these ribs at a higher temperature, you certainly wouldn\u2019t want to accidentally for 6 hours.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "5 pounds should serve four people, we halved this and found 2 1/2 pounds to be generous for 2 people and might estimate 1 pound per person next time", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup brown sugar", "2 tablespoons chili powder (ancho is recommended) or paprika", "2 teaspoons salt (see Note above about increasing it)", "2 teaspoons garlic powder", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "5 pounds spareribs, cut into 4 slabs, rinsed and patted dry", "2 teaspoons mild or hot piment\u00f3n (smoked Spanish paprika)", "1 tablespoon cider vinegar or red or white vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup brown sugar<br/>\n2 tablespoons chili powder (ancho is recommended) or paprika<br/>\n2 teaspoons salt (see Note above about increasing it)<br/>\n2 teaspoons garlic powder<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>\n5 pounds spareribs, cut into 4 slabs, rinsed and patted dry<br/>\n2 teaspoons mild or hot piment\u00f3n (smoked Spanish paprika)<br/>\n1 tablespoon cider vinegar or red or white vinegar</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 200\u00b0F.
