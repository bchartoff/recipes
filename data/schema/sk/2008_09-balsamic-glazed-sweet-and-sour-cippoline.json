Consider yourself warned.]</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Add sugar, vinegar, tomato sauce and water and bring to a boil. Cook onions <s>uncovered</s> covered (again, the splatter effect is such that a lid is worth using) until just al dente, about 10 minutes. If liquid dissipates too quickly, add more water, a 1/4 cup at a time, realizing that it is essential not to overcook the onions. The sauce should just adhere to the onions. Remove from saute pan to an earthenware dish and hold in a warm place, or allow to cool if you are serving them later or as an antipasto. Sprinkle with rosemary as a garnish.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/09-balsamic-glazed-sweet-and-sour-cippoline"}
