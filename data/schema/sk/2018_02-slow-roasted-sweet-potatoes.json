It was amazing, but I almost felt like the sweet potato itself is so good, it deserves to be the whole story here. The second time, I couldn\u2019t resist making a roasted garlic yogurt sauce and we finished the potatoes with pats of salted butter and I about wept from how good it was, so do know that this needs no bells and whistles to be worthy of your plate\u2019s best real estate.
