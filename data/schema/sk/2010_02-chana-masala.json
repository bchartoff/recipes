I\u2019m thrilled to finally have a good recipe for it at home.</p><p>The major changes I made were simplifying the addition of spices, adding more tomatoes and oh, the recipe calls for a tablespoon of amchoor powder, which I did not have. I looked it up and learned that it was dried unripe mango powder (which sounds so delicious to me, I\u2019m buying it next time I go to Kalustyan\u2019s, who also sells it online), which is clearly a sour flavor, so I upped the lemon juice i used instead. The dish had a nice sour snap at the end, so I will presume this is a good swap.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "2 medium onions, minced", "1 clove garlic, minced", "2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger", "1 fresh, hot green chili pepper, minced", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (I used a quarter of this because my cayenne is extremely hot)", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and ground", "1 tablespoon amchoor powder (see note)", "2 teaspoons paprika", "1 teaspoon garam masala", "2 cups tomatoes, chopped small or 1 15-ounce can of whole tomatoes with their juices, chopped small", "2/3 cup water", "4 cups cooked chickpeas or 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 lemon (juiced) (see note; I used a whole lemon to swap for the amchoor powder)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br/>\n2 medium onions, minced<br/>\n1 clove garlic, minced<br/>\n2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger<br/>\n1 fresh, hot green chili pepper, minced<br/>\n1 tablespoon ground coriander<br/>\n2 teaspoons ground cumin<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (I used a quarter of this because my cayenne is extremely hot)<br/>\n1 teaspoon ground turmeric<br/>\n2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and ground<br/>\n1 tablespoon amchoor powder (see note)<br/>\n2 teaspoons paprika<br/>\n1 teaspoon garam masala<br/>\n2 cups tomatoes, chopped small or 1 15-ounce can of whole tomatoes with their juices, chopped small<br/>\n2/3 cup water<br/>\n4 cups cooked chickpeas or 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon salt<br/>\n1/2 lemon (juiced) (see note; I used a whole lemon to swap for the amchoor powder)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oil in a large skillet.
