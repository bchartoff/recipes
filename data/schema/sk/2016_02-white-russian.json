The closest thing I can find to a classic advocates 2 parts vodka, 2 parts coffee liqueur and 1 part heavy cream or 2:2:1, but I have also seen versions that are heavier on the vodka and cream (5:2:3), the liqueur (1:2:1) and/or just the cream (2:2:3). Let me be absolutely no help at all except to tell you that our favorite proportions are none of the above, but after repeated, high-stakes \u201ctesting\u201d (goofing after the kids are sleep) in our \u201clab\u201d (sofa watching Netflix), we feel this \u2014 which we call the 4:3:3 because when you cook as much as I do, even drinks are measured in tablespoons \u2014 is unquestionably the best balance. We use half-and-half instead of heavy cream; with heavy cream, 1 ounce is usually sufficient. </p><p>You can of course replace the cream with milk, cow or non-dairy.
