I made a few adjustments there, too; you can use regular or coarse (turbinado or golden caster sugar, the latter of which I can only say with a terrible faux-British accent) sugar. I added some flaky salt to the crust because it is delightful there, and also a few scrapings of orange zest, because I really like it with plums. I stick the dough in the freezer instead of the fridge because I didn\u2019t want to wait any longer for my pie than I had to.</p><p>The filling calls for either prune plums or greengages (greenish-yellow sweet plums), but I could only find the prune plums but the thought all-prune pie made me nervous about its, you know, intensity. Ahem. So I swapped half the plums with apples but I forgot that apples take much longer to bake than plums and had I cut them smaller, this shouldn\u2019t have been an issue. Or I could have stopped fussing and made an all-plum pie. I added a squeeze of orange juice to the filling, again because I like orange against plums, a little less sugar and I mixed the whole thing in the pie dish, because I am lazy. I bet you can hear my friend rolling her eyes all the way on the other side of the internet, huh?</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Lid</u>", "7 tablespoons (100 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "1 cup plus 6 1/2 tablespoons (175 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon coarse or flaky salt (or less of table salt)", "Milk or cream, for brushing crust", "Coarse or fine sugar, for sprinkling crust", "Softly whipped, lightly sweetened cream, for serving", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "1 pound ripe prune plums or greengages, halved, pitted, and halved again (i.e. quartered)", "1 pound apples, peeled, cored and cut into smaller chunks (than you see in my photos)", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Squeeze or two of orange or lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling</u><br/>\n1 pound ripe prune plums or greengages, halved, pitted, and halved again (i.e. quartered)<br/>\n1 pound apples, peeled, cored and cut into smaller chunks (than you see in my photos)<br/>\n2 tablespoons sugar<br/>\n1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>\nSqueeze or two of orange or lemon juice</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make the lid:</u> In a stand mixer, cream the butter, sugar and orange zest until light and fluffy.
