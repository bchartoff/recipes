When the skillet is hot, add a  1/4-inch of oil to each and heat for 1 minute. Carefully place 2 pork chops in each skillet; do not shake the skillets or touch the chops for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook the chops until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Carefully turn the chops over and cook until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes more. I found that my chops really wanted to stick on the second side, so slide a thin spatula underneath them to loosen them from the bottom of the pan before transferring the chops to a baking sheet to keep them warm in the oven. Discard the oil the skillet if it gets too murky and repeat with remaining chops.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><em>Finish the potatoes:</em> When the potatoes are almost cooked, bring the half-and-half to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat.
