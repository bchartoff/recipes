First, they taste like dessert, not health food, thank goodness. But, they just happen to be pretty low in sugar, butter and use a chock-ton of oats. You could replace the butter with coconut oil to make these dairy-free, and as there\u2019s no egg in it, they\u2019d also then be vegan. You could use white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour to make them even more wholesome, and although I didn\u2019t audition it, I suspect a gluten-free baking flour mix would work here too, because the plain flour isn\u2019t a majority ingredient. You could eat them warm with a scoop of ice cream or cold for breakfast with a dollop of plain yogurt. And you can make them with whatever is in season; the original recipe calls for thinly sliced apples and adds cinnamon to the crumb mixture but too impatient for spring/summer, I used strawberries and rhubarb. Oh, and did I mention you make the whole recipe in your baking pan so it literally could not be faster? Seriously, what are you waiting for?</p><p>* Updated with two changes to reduce softness 5/17/14: I did a bunch of retesting and have come to the following conclusions: the bars are more crisp and cookie-like (as photographed here, and sadly, not what everyone was getting, based on comments) without the heaped 1/8 teaspoon baking soda and with an additional 1/4 cup (and even up to 2 tablespoons more, yes, really) flour. These amounts are now reflected below. They\u2019re tender when they come out of the oven but once chilled in the fridge, become cookie-like in their crisp base; I recommend keeping them in the fridge. I\u2019m so sorry if any of you were disappointed in these bars; I hope you\u2019ll find the recipe now to be as wonderful as promised.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "16 small bars, as shown, or 8 large ones; recipe can be doubled and baked in a 9\u00d713-inch baking pan, where they will come out a little thicker", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup (80 grams) rolled oats", "3/4 cup (95 grams) plus up to 2 tablespoons (15 grams) extra all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup (95 grams) light brown sugar", "Heaped 1/4 teaspoon table salt", "6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, melted", "1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional, but helps firm up the filling)", "1 tablespoon (15 ml) lemon juice", "1 tablespoon (15 grams) granulated sugar, divided", "1 cup (125 grams) small-diced rhubarb (from about 1 1/2 medium stalks)", "1 cup (155 grams) small-diced strawberries", "Powdered sugar, for decoration, if desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup (80 grams) rolled oats<br/>\n3/4 cup (95 grams) plus up to 2 tablespoons (15 grams) extra all-purpose flour<br/>\n1/2 cup (95 grams) light brown sugar<br/>\nHeaped 1/4 teaspoon table salt<br/>\n6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, melted<br/>\n1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional, but helps firm up the filling)<br/>\n1 tablespoon (15 ml) lemon juice<br/>\n1 tablespoon (15 grams) granulated sugar, divided<br/>\n1 cup (125 grams) small-diced rhubarb (from about 1 1/2 medium stalks)<br/>\n1 cup (155 grams) small-diced strawberries<br/>\nPowdered sugar, for decoration, if desired</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
