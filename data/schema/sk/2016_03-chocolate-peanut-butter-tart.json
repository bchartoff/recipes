One of the pesky things about crumb crusts is that I find that depending on the crumbs used and how finely ground they are, you might need more or less butter. Here, using shortbread loaded with butter, I only needed 3T melted butter to get the crumbs clumpy enough to form a crust. With the same amount of graham crumbs, I usually need 4T.\nI like to parbake crumb crusts because I think they set much better this way. The sugar helps \u201cglue\u201d the crust together too, but I still use as little as possible.\nI found that the recipe better filled out a 9-inch/1-inch tall tart pan than a standard pie dish. Should you not have a tart pan, you could still make this in a standard (not deep-dish) pie dish, but it might help to only press the 2/3 the way up the sides. Or, if you\u2019d really like to fill out a standard pie pan, you could double the filling and chocolate This should also work in a 8-inch square baking pan. Put a long piece of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan, letting the parchment extend up the two short sides of the pan and overhang slightly on both ends; this sling will hopefully make the bars easier to remove. \n</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Crust</u>", "2 5.3-ounce (150 gram) shortbread cookie packages (to yield 1 3/4 to 2 cups shortbread cookie crumbs)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted (see note about butter amount)", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "1/2 cup (4 ounces or 115 grams) cream cheese, softened", "2 tablespoons (1 ounce or 30 grams) unsalted butter, softened", "1/3 cup (40 grams) powdered or confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 cup (130 grams) creamy peanut butter (I use Skippy but think a more natural one would work just fine here)", "1/4 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "RECIPE_SUBHED__3<u>Topping</u>", "1 cup (about 6 ounces or 170 grams) semisweet chocolate chips", "A pinch of salt", "1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream", "Flaky sea salt, to finish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Topping</u><br/>\n1 cup (about 6 ounces or 170 grams) semisweet chocolate chips<br/>\nA pinch of salt<br/>\n1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream<br/>\nFlaky sea salt, to finish (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make the crust:</u> Heat oven to 350\u00b0F (176#176;C).
