I\u2019ve got more pancake tips <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07/blueberry-pancakes-pancake-101/\">over here</a>.) Rub the pan generously with butter; Boyce says this is the key to crisp, buttery edges. Working quickly, dollop 1/4-cup mounds of batter onto the pan, 2 or 3 at a time. Once bubbles have begun to form on the top side of the pancake, flip the pancake and cook until the bottom is dark golden-brown, about 5 minutes total. Wipe the pan with a cloth before griddling the next pancake. Continue with the rest of the batter.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Serve the pancakes hot, straight from the skillet or keep them warm in a low oven.
