A lifetime ago, I told you about Alex\u2019s Chicken and Mushroom Marsala, which I said, frankly, was all about the mushrooms while the chicken lingered in the background like a b-list celebrity. So when I saw Giada making a pasta dish that forewent the chicken to just hone in on the marsala mushrooms \u2014 and even threw in artichokes, my favorite-est vegetable \u2014 it was enough to even get this discombobulated cook organized in time for dinner.</p><p>The only note I\u2019d make about the flavor is that, though I enjoyed the subtle meatiness of the dish, I can see why others might want a little acid to brighten it up; if you find this to be the case, I think a tablespoon or so of lemon juice or a splash of balsamic added at the end might do the trick.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 small onion, finely chopped", "1 pound mushrooms, trimmed, cleaned and chopped into small bits (I used creminis)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus 1 tablespoon for pasta water", "1 cup dry Marsala wine", "1 pound pasta, Giada recommends thimble-shaped pasta, ", "<i>ditalini</i>", ", but I think I used snail-shaped or ", "<i>chiocciole</i>", "1/2 pound frozen artichoke hearts, thawed", "3/4 cup grated Parmesan", "1/2 cup cream", "1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>3 tablespoons olive oil<br/>\n1 small onion, finely chopped<br/>\n1 pound mushrooms, trimmed, cleaned and chopped into small bits (I used creminis)<br/>\n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus 1 tablespoon for pasta water<br/>\n1 cup dry Marsala wine<br/>\n1 pound pasta, Giada recommends thimble-shaped pasta, <i>ditalini</i>, but I think I used snail-shaped or <i>chiocciole</i><br/>\n1/2 pound frozen artichoke hearts, thawed<br/>\n3/4 cup grated Parmesan<br/>\n1/2 cup cream<br/>\n1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br/>\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.

Conclusion: I think I\u2019d actually like this better with twice as many mushroom and no artichokes. I mentioned above that I thought it needed some lemon or acidity \u2014 actually, artichokes do. Mushrooms and marsala sauce are perfect together, after all. I\u2019d rather save the artichokes for a more lemony pasta sauce.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/12-mushroom-marsala-pasta-with-artichokes"}
