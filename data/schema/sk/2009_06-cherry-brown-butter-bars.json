What I\u2019ve hacked it into is something a little more casual and finger-food friendly, or in our case, easier to pack up and share with friends, you know, if we\u2019re feeling generous. As for the fruit you use, no need to limit yourself to either cherries or raspberries \u2014 use whatever looks best by you right now, or whatever you have on hand. I bet you could even carry this into fall with apple or pear slivers.</p><p>Special equipment: Although not a prerequisite to make these, if you\u2019re the type of person who has cherry pitter or even a removable-bottom brownie pan, this recipe will be even more of a cinch.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes 16 2-inch square bars (pictured), or 32 2\u00d71-inch bars, if you, like me, prefer baked goods bite-sized", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Crust:</u>", "7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1/3 cup sugar", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon all purpose flour", "Pinch of salt", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling:</u>", "1/2 cup sugar", "2 large eggs", "Pinch of salt", "1/4 cup all purpose flour", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, diced", "1 pound sweet cherries, which will yield 12 ounces of pitted cherries, which yielded some leftovers, perfect for snacking (alternately, you can use 12 ounces of the berry of your choice)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling:</u><br/>\n1/2 cup sugar<br/>\n2 large eggs<br/>\nPinch of salt<br/>\n1/4 cup all purpose flour<br/>\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, diced<br/>\n1 pound sweet cherries, which will yield 12 ounces of pitted cherries, which yielded some leftovers, perfect for snacking (alternately, you can use 12 ounces of the berry of your choice)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><b>Make crust:</b> Preheat over to 375\u00b0F.
