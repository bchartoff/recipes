Golden syrup is a pure cane syrup that can be used instead of corn syrup in most candy and caramel recipes and tastes infinitely better, as it has a slight caramel flavor to it. If you live outside the U.S., especially in the U.K. you\u2019ve probably been using it your whole life but here it\u2019s still a specialty item. I took the fact that Whole Foods on Houston was selling it in two different packages (canned and bottled) as a sign that this is probably slowly changing. (It\u2019s also sold online over here and a bunch of other places Google can point you to, if needed.) If you cannot get golden syrup and don\u2019t wish to use corn syrup, both honey and maple syrup will work as well, but of course impart different flavors.</p><p>Canning: Yes, I know I tempted you with tiny jars of ready-to-gift fudge, and I didn\u2019t mean to be a tease, it\u2019s just that products with dairy in them \u2014 and this has a ton \u2014 are not safe to can. But I see no reason why you cannot simply leave a note that it should be kept in the fridge and used within a week or two, right?</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes about 2 cups", "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup heavy or whipping cream", "1/2 cup light corn syrup or golden syrup (see Note above)", "1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, ideally Dutch-processed", "Heaping 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt or level 1/4 teaspoon table salt", "6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped (or, about 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips), divided", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract, or to taste", "Crushed candy canes, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2/3 cup heavy or whipping cream<br/>\n1/2 cup light corn syrup or golden syrup (see Note above)<br/>\n1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar<br/>\n1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, ideally Dutch-processed<br/>\nHeaping 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt or level 1/4 teaspoon table salt<br/>\n6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped (or, about 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips), divided<br/>\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract, or to taste<br/>\nCrushed candy canes, for serving (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a 1 1/2 to 2-quart heavy saucepan, bring cream, syrup, sugar, cocoa, salt (if you\u2019d like the salt to remain slightly textured, add it with the butter and extract at the end) and half the chocolate to a boil.
