The lime is awesome, although I really have to advise against the whole lime segments they suggest in the original recipe (which I omit here) as we lovelovelove lime around here and it was still too much lime, by far. Peanuts are wonderful, even better if you can find some of those giant Virginia peanuts I sometimes see at stores (these, sadly, were not). The spinach is definitely a little odd in the slaw department; it is not the most stable lettuce thus not the kind of thing I\u2019d want to eat hours after it had been tossed with dressing but in this, it works. And it makes the salad even prettier, which in my book counts too.", "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 small red cabbage, trimmed, cored, and shredded (about 6 cups)", "1/2 small green cabbage, trimmed, cored, and shredded (about 6 cups)", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 bunch fresh baby spinach, stemmed and cut into 1/2-inch wide ribbons (about 4 cups loosely packed)", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from about 2 small limes)", "1 tablespoon Dijon or other salty prepared mustard", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 cup peanut oil", "1/2 cup roasted unsalted peanuts, coarsely chopped", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1/2 small red cabbage, trimmed, cored, and shredded (about 6 cups)<br/>\n1/2 small green cabbage, trimmed, cored, and shredded (about 6 cups)<br/>\n1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more to taste<br/>\n1 bunch fresh baby spinach, stemmed and cut into 1/2-inch wide ribbons (about 4 cups loosely packed)<br/>\n1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from about 2 small limes)<br/>\n1 tablespoon Dijon or other salty prepared mustard<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br/>\n1/4 cup peanut oil<br/>\n1/2 cup roasted unsalted peanuts, coarsely chopped<br/>\nFreshly ground black pepper</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a large bowl, toss the shredded red and green cabbage with the salt.
