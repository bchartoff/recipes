I ordered a par-baked country loaf from Fresh Direct that first needed to be baked and cooled, before it could be rendered into croutons. (Could I be more ridiculous?) Then I fell all gaga over some cranberry beans at the Greenmarket yesterday, so I had to shell and pre-boil them before adding them to the dish. (Though canned and drained beans, or skipping the beans entirely, would also do.) And yes, I know asparagus season has really passed but that off-season stuff isn\u2019t a quarter bad.</p><p>And now, some cooking notes: The asparagus will be very al dente, cooked in this method. We love it that way, but if you like yours with more give, you can start it a couple minutes earlier in pan or steam it for a minute or two before you add it. Marcona almods are fantastic if you can find them, but because I couldn\u2019t, I used slivered almonds which burned easily \u2014 not recommended; use the whole ones. The beans are optional and not part of the original recipe, but we liked them in there a lot.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large, thick, firm asparagus, lower third of the stalks peeled with a vegetable peeler or snapped off", "1/4 cup good olive oil", "4 ounces Spanish chorizo (but Portuguese chouri\u00e7o will work as well), cut into 3/4-inch pieces", "1 1/2 cups 3/4-inch bread cubes (croutons), preferably from a baguette or country bread loaf", "1/4 cup whole almonds", "1 cup cooked beans (optional; I used 3/4 pound fresh cranberry beans, shelled then boiled for 20 minutes in lightly salted water)", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 pound large, thick, firm asparagus, lower third of the stalks peeled with a vegetable peeler or snapped off<br/>\n1/4 cup good olive oil<br/>\n4 ounces Spanish chorizo (but Portuguese chouri\u00e7o will work as well), cut into 3/4-inch pieces<br/>\n1 1/2 cups 3/4-inch bread cubes (croutons), preferably from a baguette or country bread loaf<br/>\n1/4 cup whole almonds<br/>\n1 cup cooked beans (optional; I used 3/4 pound fresh cranberry beans, shelled then boiled for 20 minutes in lightly salted water)<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon salt<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Make this right as you are ready to eat.
