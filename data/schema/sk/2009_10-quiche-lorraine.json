Except it is not.), Le Pain Quotidien. I loved their barely sweet granola bars, their hefty miche and countless simple lunches like this. (I believe they had a cookbook at some point, but it is either AWOL or out of print or maybe I\u2019m just making this up?) Nevertheless, I found this recipe online and was chomping at the bit to make it, stat. No seriously, like the minute I got home from the hospital.</p><p>What sets this apart from other versions of this quiche is the piles of caramelized leeks and the richer-than-rich sour and heavy cream custard, two things I implore you not to miss out on. I hadn\u2019t made this tart crust before, but was very impressed by how easy it came together and how crisp it remained as a shell without requiring a par-baking. I will definitely use it again.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups diced leeks, white and light green only (from about 2 large leeks, although I think you can get away with one super-big leek)", "3/4 cup diced onion", "2 1/2 teaspoons olive oil (I needed a tad more)", "1 1/4 cups flour", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch", "Salt", "6 tablespoons butter, diced", "4 eggs, divided", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sour cream", "Pinch nutmeg", "Pinch pepper", "1 1/2 cups diced ham (1/4 -inch dice; I used about 1/2 pound)", "3/4 cup grated Swiss cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 3/4 cups diced leeks, white and light green only (from about 2 large leeks, although I think you can get away with one super-big leek)<br/>\n3/4 cup diced onion<br/>\n2 1/2 teaspoons olive oil (I needed a tad more)<br/>\n1 1/4 cups flour<br/>\n1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch<br/>\nSalt<br/>\n6 tablespoons butter, diced<br/>\n4 eggs, divided<br/>\n1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream<br/>\n1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sour cream<br/>\nPinch nutmeg<br/>\nPinch pepper<br/>\n1 1/2 cups diced ham (1/4 -inch dice; I used about 1/2 pound)<br/>\n3/4 cup grated Swiss cheese</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1.
