Mine is to cover a large egg with cold water and put it on the stove and bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, set a timer to exactly 9 or 10 minutes, and reduce the heat to medium. Once it\u2019s done, I often plunge it in icy water so that it will stop cooking immediately and also chill quickly. At 9 minutes, large eggs will be a little tender in the center, as you can see in the top photo. At 10, it will be a fully-cooked (but not overcooked) egg. </p><p>If you\u2019re freaked out by raw red onion, you can actually add it to the dressing in the skillet for the last 10 seconds to soften it and remove more of the bite, and pour the onions and dressing over the salad together.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 as an appetizer or 2 spinach salad enthusiasts", "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces baby spinach", "2 large white mushrooms, thinly sliced", "1/4 small or medium red onion, very thinly sliced", "1 large egg, hard-boiled (see above), chilled, peeled and thinly sliced", "4 pieces thick-sliced bacon (about 4 ounces), finely diced", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon honey or sugar", "1/2 teaspoon smooth Dijon mustard", "Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>4 ounces baby spinach<br/>\n2 large white mushrooms, thinly sliced<br/>\n1/4 small or medium red onion, very thinly sliced<br/>\n1 large egg, hard-boiled (see above), chilled, peeled and thinly sliced<br/>\n4 pieces thick-sliced bacon (about 4 ounces), finely diced<br/>\n2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon honey or sugar<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon smooth Dijon mustard<br/>\nCoarse salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place spinach in a large, wide salad serving bowl.
