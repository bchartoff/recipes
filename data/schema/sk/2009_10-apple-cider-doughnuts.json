One of the many things that appealed to me about this recipe was the way the apple cider was reduced and concentrated to hopefully give it more presence. And despite the fact that these are cake doughnuts, which have always played second fiddle to yeast doughnuts in my experience (likely because cake are more likely to get stale sooner, or you know, by the time you buy them), I think this is all the more reason to make them at home.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Personally, I don\u2019t think a sweetened doughnut needs any kind of topping, but I went with a cinnamon-sugar coating anyway.
