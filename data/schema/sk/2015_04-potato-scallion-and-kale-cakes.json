Use about 2 tablespoons batter (I used a cookie scoop that holds slightly less) per pancake, flattening them as they hit the pan. Cook until golden brown underneath, just a couple minutes, before flipping them and cooking them on the reverse side until golden and crisp as well. Drain on paper towels, but be gentle as they are still fragile. You can keep them warm in a 200 degree oven while cooking off the rest of the batter, adding more oil as needed and letting pan cool between batches if it gets too hot.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Serve scattered with reserved scallion stems, if desired, topped with a <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2014/10/the-crispy-egg/\">crispy egg</a> or alongside a dollop of sour cream or plain yogurt.
