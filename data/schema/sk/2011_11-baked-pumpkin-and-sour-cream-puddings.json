Yeah, it didn\u2019t go so well. That would have been too happy an ending, right? I found my first pudding a little too wet and coarse and I remembered writing about silky smooth pumpkin pie a few years ago (and mocking the fussiness of adding so many steps to a simple pie, that was, until I tried it) and decided to make it again with a couple of Cooks Illustrated\u2019s suggestions, namely pureeing the squash in a food processor and cooking some of the water of of the squash on the stove before baking. I really liked the second version better, but since I always made it the lazy way before (and without complaint), I\u2019ll explain where you can skip extra steps. But seriously, the extra steps really amp up the dreamy pudding-ness of the whole affair, and don\u2019t take terribly long.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "7 to 8 half-cup puddings", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Pudding</u>", "1 3/4 cups (from a 15-ounce can, 415 grams) pumpkin puree (unsweetened; not pumpkin pie filling)", "1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon (2 grams) ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) table salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 cup (237 ml) whole milk", "1/2 cup (118 ml) heavy cream", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Topping</u>", "1 cup (227 grams) sour cream", "1 tablespoon (13 grams) granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Topping</u><br/>\n1 cup (227 grams) sour cream<br/>\n1 tablespoon (13 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) vanilla extract</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>The quickest method: In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the pudding ingredients.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>For creamier, silkier pudding: Combine pumpkin, sugar, salt and spices in a food processor and blend for 30 seconds.
