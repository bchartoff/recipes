I find it fluffy and weightless. I prefer my parmesan with more bite, gravitas. But here, it\u2019s the very best way to go, rendering parmesan so fine that merely a whisk will turn it into a sauce. Plus, you\u2019ll already be using it for the lemon zest, right? If you don\u2019t have one, use the tiniest holes on a box grater. You can also use the food processor method we do in the cacio e pepe, blending it to a as-smooth-as-possible paste in the machine before returning it to the bowl where the pasta will go.", "totalTime": "P0DT0H15M0S", "recipeYield": "2 to 3", "recipeIngredient": ["Coarse salt", "1/2 pound (8 ounces or 225 grams) dried spaghetti", "1 lemon", "3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) parmesan cheese", "Freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons (45 ml) olive oil", "Fresh basil leaves, torn"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Boil the spaghetti in well-salted water according to package directions. While it boils, finely grate (with a rasp-style grater; here\u2019s the most common one but I prefer this size) the zest of half your lemon into the large bowl you\u2019ll use to serve your dish. Add the juice of the whole lemon (about 4 tablespoons). Use the same rasp to grate the parmesan on top. Add olive oil, about 1/2 teaspoon salt (and more to taste), and several grinds of black pepper and combine them with a whisk until very well mixed and as smooth as possible. When the pasta reaches the ideal texture, scoop out 1 cup of cooking water, set it aside, and drain the rest. Quickly turn piping hot spaghetti to lemon-parmesan mixture in bowl and use tongs or spoons to toss it until all of the strands are coated. Don\u2019t worry if the mixture seems too thick or sticky \u2014 first get the strands as evenly coated as possible. Add reserved pasta water, a tiny splash (about 1 to 2 tablespoons) at a time, tossing the whole time, only until the spaghetti looks glossy and lightly sauced, but no so much that you \u201cwash\u201d the sauce off the pasta. You might only need a single splash to achieve this. Add basil leaves and toss to combine, then serve. If you finish each serving with a little extra olive oil, salt, pepper, and parmesan, you\u2019ll be glad you did. "}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/06-simplest-spaghetti-al-limone"}
