On the breakfast side, do know that these taste excellent with up to a 2/3 (1 1/3 cup) flour swap with whole wheat flour (possibly more, but I only tested them that far). I also ended up retesting them with more carrots than you\u2019ll see the in photos, a full 2 cups (in the final recipe below) to make them even more vegetable-packed. They\u2019re very lightly sweet and practically one-bowl for those of us who do not motivate willingly in the morning. And then there\u2019s the glaze \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure a sweet glaze puts these squarely in the cake-or-afternoon-tea category, and less a breakfast, but that\u2019s for you to decide. Indecisive myself, I only glazed half. Finally, please note that while the tahini provides a nutty background the muffins, the glaze is only for tahini junkies as the flavor is front and center. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 muffins", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Muffins</u>", "1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil", "1/4 cup (30 grams) well-stirred tahini", "1/2 cup (80 grams) firmly packed light brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup (175 ml) buttermilk, almond milk or (nonalcoholic) apple cider", "1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour (see Note)", "2 cup packed coarsely grated carrots (from about 9 ounces or 5 slim carrots)", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Glaze</u>", " (optional)", "1/2 cup (60 grams) powdered sugar", "3 tablespoons (25 grams) tahini", "2 tablespoons (30 ml) water", "Toasted sesame seeds for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Glaze</u> (optional)<br/>\n1/2 cup (60 grams) powdered sugar<br/>\n3 tablespoons (25 grams) tahini<br/>\n2 tablespoons (30 ml) water<br/>\nToasted sesame seeds for garnish</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 425 degrees F.
