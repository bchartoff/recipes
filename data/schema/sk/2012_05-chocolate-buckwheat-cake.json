Ones scaled accordingly usually use 1/3 cup of all-purpose flour (nixing the buckwheat and almond) and a bit more sugar, up to double, in fact, but I wouldn\u2019t go over 3/4 cup. I hesitate to tell you to swap regular flour if you wish given that I haven\u2019t outright tested this cake with that formula, but I feel 98% confident that it will work just fine. </p><p>Nevertheless, the buckwheat is delightful here. I promise, it won\u2019t taste whole wheat or earnest or like an apology for a run-in with French fries the day before. Buckwheat flour, with its fine, silky crumb and utter lack of gluten (yes, this cake is gluten-free), adds structure but not density and that structure has the mildest, faintest nutty earthy flavor which contrasts all the other wonders (chocolate, butter, sugar, vanilla) fantastically. Trust me. </p><p>If you don\u2019t have almond flour, you can grind blanched slivered or sliced almonds in a food processor or coffee grinder. I find it easier to get a finer grind without it turning to almond butter by grinding it with a flour, such as the buckwheat here.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "One thin 9-inch round cake", "recipeIngredient": ["7 tablespoons (100 grams or 3 1/2 ounces) unsalted butter, plus extra for buttering pan", "3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) bittersweet dark chocolate (70 to 72 percent is ideal)", "4 large eggs at room temperature", "1/2 cup (100 grams or 3 1/2 ounces) granulated or blond cane sugar", "A good pinch of sea salt", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/4 cup (35 grams or 1 1/4 ounces) buckwheat flour", "1/4 cup (30 grams or 1 ounce) almond meal", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, lightly whipped cream and/or berries to serve (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>7 tablespoons (100 grams or 3 1/2 ounces) unsalted butter, plus extra for buttering pan<br/>\n3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) bittersweet dark chocolate (70 to 72 percent is ideal)<br/>\n4 large eggs at room temperature<br/>\n1/2 cup (100 grams or 3 1/2 ounces) granulated or blond cane sugar<br/>\nA good pinch of sea salt<br/>\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>\n1/4 cup (35 grams or 1 1/4 ounces) buckwheat flour<br/>\n1/4 cup (30 grams or 1 ounce) almond meal<br/>\nConfectioners\u2019 sugar, lightly whipped cream and/or berries to serve (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).
