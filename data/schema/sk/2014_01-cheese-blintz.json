(Hint: Just do what sounds best.) If you have a cr\u00eape recipe you like best, go ahead and use it here instead, but if you\u2019re a cr\u00eape newbie, I think you\u2019ll find this one remarkably easy. Use a small skillet if you have one; I think 6 to 7-inch is the ideal cr\u00eape size for blintz, but am limited to 8- to 9-inch cr\u00eape due to the skillets I have. As for fillings, you can use no egg or yolk, or, you can add a yolk or two for richness (great with more dry cheeses) or a whole egg for firmness (great with wetter fillings, like a loose/watery cottage or ricotta cheese). You can add more sugar (up to 1/4 cup) to the filling if you like a sweet blintz; I prefer just a tiny amount, since we always use sweet toppings and I prefer a taste contrast.</p><p>Favorite toppings, from the archives: This Sour Cherry Compote, this Strawberry-Rhubarb Compote, this Strawberry Coulis, this Blackberry Sauce, or, if you, like me, canned a copious amount of strawberry jam that never set last summer, this is the most heavenly place to enlist it.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Yield (with 8-inch cr\u00eape and 3 tablespoons of filling in each): 12", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Wrappers</u>", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly", "1 cup milk (fat level shouldn\u2019t matter, but I use whole)", "4 large eggs", "1 cup all-purpose flour (I swap 1/3 to 1/2 regularly with whole wheat, and did so here)", "Few pinches of salt", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "2 cups farmer\u2019s cheese, quark, a thicker cottage cheese or ricotta", "6 tablespoons sour cream, mascarpone, creme fraiche or softened cream cheese", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar (or more to taste, see Note up top)", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract (if desired)", "Few gratings fresh lemon zest (if desired)", "2 large egg yolks or 1 large egg (optional, see Note up top)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling</u><br/>\n2 cups farmer\u2019s cheese, quark, a thicker cottage cheese or ricotta<br/>\n6 tablespoons sour cream, mascarpone, creme fraiche or softened cream cheese<br/>\n2 tablespoons granulated sugar (or more to taste, see Note up top)<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract (if desired)<br/>\nFew gratings fresh lemon zest (if desired)<br/>\n2 large egg yolks or 1 large egg (optional, see Note up top)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Make wrapper/cr\u00eape batter:</i> Combine wrapper ingredients in a blender, or in a bowl with an immersion blender, or whisk by hand until smooth.

Pour 3 to 4 tablespoons batter into skillet, just enough that it coats the bottom in an even layer when you swirl it around.
