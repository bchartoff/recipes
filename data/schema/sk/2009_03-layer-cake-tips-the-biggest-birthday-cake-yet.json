We used the cake recipe for the bottom tier of the wedding cake (that post contains the recipe for a regular-sized version of the cake), though three layers tall when this one is only two (I didn\u2019t think a birthday cake needed the height/grandiosity of a wedding cake) and the filling we used on those layers (Brandied Bittersweet Ganache) was actually the frosting on this (though realizing I\u2019d made extra, I put a little between the layers too).</p><p>I go back and forth between this chocolate layer cake and that from the Double Chocolate Layer Cake. That one is, hands down, the most incredible chocolate layer cake \u2014 it\u2019s insanely moist and soft and light-tasting and nobody who has made it regretted it. However, this cake also has its glories; it\u2019s sturdier but still moist, it\u2019s practically a one-bowl recipe and it\u2019s a lot easier to work with because it\u2019s not so soft that if you pick it up, you\u2019ll end up with a handful of crumbs. (The downside of an extremely soft cake, if there could ever be one.) For large cakes and wedding cakes, or if you find soft cakes hard to work with, this is the one to use.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Last note/warning: This yields a ridiculous amount of batter, too much for my 5 quart Kitchen Aid or any of my bowls.
