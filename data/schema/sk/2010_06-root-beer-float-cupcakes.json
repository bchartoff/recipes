I tried to turn this into a cupcake a few ways, first with a plain whipped cream frosting (hoping the cream could stand in for ice cream) and then with both whipped cream and a tiny, nested scoop of ice cream. Both are delicious. Neither are particularly portable. The whipped cream is good for two hours at room temperature but the ice cream, only a few minutes. If you\u2019re bringing them somewhere else, I suggest bringing the ice cream and/or whipped cream separately and assembling them on the spot; get others involved, I am sure it could be fun. You could also swap out both toppings for a more traditional, stable frosting such as a Quick Buttercream or a Seven Minute Frosting (my vote, because it tastes like marshmallows). </p><p>I also want to note that while the root beer flavor is present in the cakes, it\u2019s not the loudest root beer flavor (unsurprising as most root beers today are pretty subtle). One way to make it more pronounced, as suggested in Baked, is to swap out half a cup of root beer for root beer schnapps, which looks like it is available from  a few places online. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Cupcakes</u>", "2 cups root beer (I used ", "<a href=\"http://www.boylanbottling.com/\">Boylan</a>", " because it was easy to find and made with cane sugar)", "1 cup dark unsweetened cocoa powder", "1/2 cup (1 stick or 4 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 1/4 cups granulated sugar", "1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar", "2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda", "1 teaspoon salt", "2 large eggs", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Toppings</u>", "1 1/2 cups heavy or whipping cream", "3 tablespoons powdered sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pint of vanilla ice cream (you\u2019ll have leftover; you\u2019re welcome)", "Maraschino cherries (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Toppings</u><br/>\n1 1/2 cups heavy or whipping cream<br/>\n3 tablespoons powdered sugar<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>\nPint of vanilla ice cream (you\u2019ll have leftover; you\u2019re welcome)<br/>\nMaraschino cherries (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make the root beer cupcakes:</u> Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.
