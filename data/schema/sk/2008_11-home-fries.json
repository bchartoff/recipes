The first is cooking the onions separately. As potatoes need to cook quite a bit longer than onions, it saves them from become burnt specks by the time the potatoes are ready. The second is more of a shortcut (so you can make them more often because they\u2019re easier!) which is that I reduce the pan-frying time by half cooking them in the microwave first. As the best French fries are twice-cooked, this follows that line of reasoning well, yielding home fries with a soft center and crisp edges.", "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch cubes", "4 tablespoons salted butter", "1 onions, finely chopped", "Salt and pepper to taste", "Seasoning of your choice: Garlic powder or salt work great, as does smoky Spanish paprika or chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch cubes<br/>\n4 tablespoons salted butter<br/>\n1 onions, finely chopped<br/>\nSalt and pepper to taste<br/>\nSeasoning of your choice: Garlic powder or salt work great, as does smoky Spanish paprika or chopped chives</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1.
