I was scared, people. The recipes I found online were few and far between and looked\u2026 dubious. It was until I met Joe Pastry (and by \u201cmet\u201d I mean, became obsessed with his site and I\u2019m sorry, but do you bake? Because if you do, you\u2019d be crazy not to read his entire archives, right this very minute) and gazed at his crystal-clear step-by-step photos that I knew I could not only pull them off at home but that I had to use his recipe. Once again, Joe did not fail. </p><p>This dough is excellent, not only because it produces the soft, flaky dough that are the epitome of the knish experience, but because once it comes together (quickly), it can be used now or later, up to three days later, kept refrigerated. The dough can be used to make the classic Russet-and-caramelized-onions filling here, or the non-traditional Red Potato, Leek and Kale one below. </p><p>Updated 3/17 to increase the amount of water from 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup. Joe\u2019s original recipe calls for 1/2 cup but, strangely, I found I only needed 1/4 cup.

Divide the dough in half. On a well-floured surface, roll the first half of the dough into a very thin sheet, roughly in the shape of a 1-foot square, but really, no need to be rigid about it. For moderate size knish (smaller than the traditional \u201cdoorstops\u201d but still hefty, about 3 inches across), create a 2-inch thick log from half your potato filling across the bottom of your dough. Roll the filling up in the dough like you were rolling a cigarette (which, of course, we would <i>never</i>), but not too tight. A tiny amount of slack will keep the dough from opening in the oven. Keep rolling until the log has been wrapped twice in dough. Trim any unrolled length and add it to the second half of the dough; it can be used again. Repeat the process with the second half of your dough and second half of filling; you might have a small amount of dough leftover.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Trim the ends of the dough so that they\u2019re even with the potato filling. Then, make indentations on the log every 3 to 3 1/2 inches (you\u2019ll have about 3, if your log was 1 foot long) and twist the dough at these points, as if you were making sausage links. Snip the dough at each twist, then pinch one of the ends of each segment together to form a sealed knish base.  Use the palm of your hand to flatten the knish a bit into a squat shape and from here, you can take one of two approaches to the top: You can pinch together the tops as you did the bottom to seal them; indenting them with a small dimple will help keep them from opening in the oven. You can gently press the dough over the filling but leave it mostly open, like the knish you would get on Houston Street. Or, you can half-ass it (okay, that\u2019s a third option, and watch your language, Deb), like I did, closing them but not sealing them well because you are indecisive. But why would you want to do a thing like that?</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><em>Bake knish:</em> Arrange knish on prepared baking sheet so that they don\u2019t touch.

I have burnt my mouth on every knish I have ever taken a bite of because that potato filling, it packs heat. Don\u2019t do as I always do and let them cool a little bit before digging in. Spicy mustard is a traditional accompaniment, but I like a dollop of sour cream too.
