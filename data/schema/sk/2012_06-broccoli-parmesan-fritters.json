And when you cook them right \u2014 that is, to a crisp, in a preheated, heavy, oil-slicked skillet \u2014 they get a fantastic crisp edge to them, like they were coated in frico.

Once hot, add a good slick of oil (I usually use a mix of olive and vegetable oil), about 2 to 3 tablespoons. Once the oil is hot (you can test it by flicking a droplet of water into it; it should hiss and sputter), scoop a two tablespoon-size mound of the batter and drop it into the pan, then flatten it slightly with your spoon or spatula. Repeat with additional batter, leaving a couple inches between each. Once brown underneath, about 2 to 3 minutes, flip each fritter and cook on the other side until equally golden, about another 1 to 2 minutes.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Transfer briefly to paper towels to drain, then to a serving plate if you\u2019ll be eating them shortly or a baking sheet in a 200 degree oven if you\u2019d like to keep them warm for a while until needed.
