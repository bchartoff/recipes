Spring onions would be a nicer replacement. So could a mixture of scallions and a handful of spinach. Mainly, you\u2019re looking for something small and onion-y to saute until translucent, but retain some sharpness, and a green to lightly wilt. I think that whatever you choose will be delicious.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2013/04-ramp-pizza"}
