From Amy Scattergood: \u201cAlthough you can make harissa out of virtually any dried chile that suits your personal heat index, most traditional harissas use chiles that are only about as hot as anchos or pasillas. Guajillo and New Mexico chiles, according to cookbook author Paula Wolfert, are the closest to the peppers of Nabeul and Gab\u00e8s in Tunisia. Use one or both, or add a few chipotle chiles into the mix: The smokiness of the chipotles adds a terrific earthy note. Or, if you like more heat, add a generous handful of chiles de arbol or even some red-hot Thai chiles \u2014 the flavors will mellow a bit, though not that much.\u201d For the total of 4 ounces dried chiles, I used a mix of 2 ounces negro, 1 ounce ancho and 1 ounce chipotle chiles. </p><p>My other changes were adjustments to personal taste; I used much less garlic than the 4 cloves originally recommended, as I didn\u2019t want it to overwhelm (and a single clove of the stuff I get at farmer\u2019s markets is usually quite strong). And I added a little cumin, because I love it here. Finally, Amy recommends only using half your roasted red pepper but I always use all of it. We already know I\u2019m a wimp about heat, but the final harissa doesn\u2019t suffer any mildness because of it, just an extra boost of flavor. The recipe below includes these adjustments. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes about 1 1/4 cups", "recipeIngredient": ["1 large red bell pepper", "4 ounces dried chiles (see suggestions above)", "3 sun-dried tomatoes, dry-packed", "2 clove garlic, peeled", "1 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon ground coriander (1 1/2 teaspoons seeds, toasted and ground)", "1/2 teaspoon ground caraway (or 1 teaspoon seeds, toasted and ground)", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin (or 1 teaspoon seeds, toasted and ground)", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus extra for storage"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 large red bell pepper<br/>\n4 ounces dried chiles (see suggestions above)<br/>\n3 sun-dried tomatoes, dry-packed<br/>\n2 clove garlic, peeled<br/>\n1 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt<br/>\n3/4 teaspoon ground coriander (1 1/2 teaspoons seeds, toasted and ground)<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon ground caraway (or 1 teaspoon seeds, toasted and ground)<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin (or 1 teaspoon seeds, toasted and ground)<br/>\n1 tablespoon olive oil, plus extra for storage</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Roast your red pepper: You can do so in a 350\u00b0F oven, turning it every 15 minutes for a total of 45 to 60, until it\u2019s deeply roasted on all sides.
