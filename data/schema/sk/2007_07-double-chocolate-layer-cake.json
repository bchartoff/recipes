This is just my hack, and I also used it earlier in the year when a certain 2 year-old required an Elmo + Pals cake. First, chill your cake in the fridge until the top frosting is firm. Second, find a linear, clip-art-like picture of what you want to trace on. Print it to a size you want on your cake. Cut it out. Use a toothpick to gently trace the exterior shape onto the cake. Remove the image and then start cutting it apart as needed along its interior lines, but make sure you can put it back together again. Lay each puzzle piece individually within the outside shape and trace it, too, then get rid of it. Eventually you\u2019ll have a lo-fi sketch of the shapes you want to fill in. Mix some frosting colors to match the colors you need and use a small round tip to begin outlining and filling in the shapes."}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/07-double-chocolate-layer-cake"}
