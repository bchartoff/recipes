One can spend a horrific amount of time (trust me) trying to figure out what the correct temperature of a slow-cooker is, only to realize that while many hover around 175 degrees F, even more have no temperature control, and simply deliver a constant heat to ingredients eventually bringing them to a very low simmer. There\u2019s no reason to get hung up on this. To make the equivalent stock on your stove, aim for slow and low \u2014 a very, very low simmer that you keep going as long as you have patience for, but ideally 4 to 5 hours. You may need to replace some water as it cooks as pots tend to evaporate more water than slow-cookers."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "How should I use this? You can use this as stock or broth in any soup. You can use it to cook grains or beans. But most importantly, the flavor is so wonderful that you can have it straight. It particularly excels in broth-y soups, like Chicken Noodle, Matzo Ball and Italian Wedding-style soups, where you directly taste the stock. Here, I show you how I simmered in some vegetables (and later, chicken chunks) to make a chicken noodle soup. Next, I\u2019d love to talk about soup noodles, but at 1,500-plus words here, I think I\u2019ve done run out of space, eh?"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Why chicken wings? In Cook\u2019s Illustrated\u2019s chicken broth tests, they found that both chicken legs along and necks and backs lent a \u201clivery\u201d taste to the broth. In my own experiments, saving the backs of chickens that I take apart in the freezer to later make broth with, I reluctantly agree (i.e. I wish it were some other way). Chicken wings, with their high bone-to-flesh ratio, made most refined and full-flavored broth and it took me a single sip of this stock to be fully converted."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Do I have to toss the cooked wings when I\u2019m done? Yes and no. I find them overcooked, but not really inedible, so it\u2019s a matter of preference. One thing I love about this recipe is that wings have so little usable flesh, it feels less wasteful than making chicken with larger parts can be (especially because they usually get overcooked and tough, thus, at least I do want to eat them)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "* What\u2019s the difference between stock and broth? In most grocery store aisles, they\u2019re used interchangeably but technically, there are small small differences. Stock is often heavier in bones and things that will add body, as this recipe is, though it doesn\u2019t have to be. However, it is unseasoned, which means to make this a true stock, you would skip the salt. Stock is often used in restaurants to make reductions (it is really the backbone of restaurant cooking), and if you reduce something already salty, obviously, you will have an oversalted mess. So, salt is added when needed for final dishes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Why is my stock so thick? If you\u2019ve never made stock before, it might have been a surprise to find that it became like Jell-o in the fridge over night. This is a good thing; this is excellent! It actually became exactly like Jell-o because stocks cooked for a long time with bones release the natural collagen in them. Stocks that jiggle when cool are the ones with the best and deepest flavors. Once warmed (even a little), it will immediately re-liquefy \u2014 do not fret.

I was reluctant at first to share this recipe (despite being unable to stop myself from gushing about it to anyone who asked and a great many people who did not) because it felt excessively lush to me. I mean, three pounds of wings just to throw them away? Given, it\u2019s quite easy to buy wings inexpensively in bulk (sometimes as disturbingly cheap as $1/pound), but if you prefers to buy local/cage-free/etc.-type chicken, it\u2019s not exactly the cheapest way to approach what\u2019s supposed to be the most economical kitchen ingredient, designed to use up scraps. But, when I actually ran the numbers, using wings on the priciest end of the spectrum (here, organic/antibiotic-free $3.99/pound and each pound of parts yields 1 quart of stock) the equivalent stuff from the box (the organic, free-range broth I\u2019d buy is $4.50/quart, boasted such lovely ingredients as \u201cyeast extract\u201d and \u201cchicken flavor), I realized that even if the taste didn\u2019t speak for itself (it will), I\u2019d been wrong about the cost.
