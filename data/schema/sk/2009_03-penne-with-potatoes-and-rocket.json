Fill it with cold, cold water. Cut the attached part of the arugula bundle off (so they\u2019re in individual sprigs) and drop the bundle in the water. Have a colander nearby. Swish, swish, swish the arugula around with your hand and then scoop it up and dump it in the colander, being careful not to pick up the sandy dirt you\u2019ve just dropped to the bottom of the water. (That\u2019s the genius, by the way, the dirt always drops off.) If the water is still foggy/beige, rinse the bowl out and repeat this process until it is clear, and the sand at the bottom is at a minimum. Shake out the lettuce in the colander and either spin it in a salad spinner or spread it out on a big dish towel until it is dry. I actually wash all lettuces this way, but arugula, being particularly dirt-crusted, is particularly made for this technique.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/03-penne-with-potatoes-and-rocket"}
