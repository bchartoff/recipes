That kind of stepped-up home cooking speaks to me, as I have a hard time summoning the effort to make something unless it\u2019s going to taste a little better than we might expect from the dish. This recipe perfectly embodies this: caramelized leeks, layered with toasted bread, cheese and custard that could be breakfast, lunch or dinner. It\u2019s my kind of dish.</p><p>The flavors here are pretty subtle, but they work. Nonetheless, there\u2019s definitely potential to increase the amount of leeks you use and increase the amount of cheese. You might also add another saut\u00e9ed vegetables or some sharp parmesan as well. This is a flexible recipe.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 as a side dish", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup leeks in 1/2-inch thick slices, white and light green parts only, cleaned and rinsed", "Kosher or coarse salt", "2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter", "Freshly ground black pepper", "6 cups 1-inch-cubed crustless brioche or Pullman loaf (I used a little less than one loaf)", "2 teaspoons finely chopped chives (I forgot to buy these; it made me sad)", "1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves", "1 large egg", "1 large egg yolk", "3 cups whole milk, heavy cream or half-and-half or a combination thereof", "Freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 cup shredded Comt\u00e9, Emmanthaler or Swiss cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup leeks in 1/2-inch thick slices, white and light green parts only, cleaned and rinsed<br/>\nKosher or coarse salt<br/>\n2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter<br/>\nFreshly ground black pepper<br/>\n6 cups 1-inch-cubed crustless brioche or Pullman loaf (I used a little less than one loaf)<br/>\n2 teaspoons finely chopped chives (I forgot to buy these; it made me sad)<br/>\n1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves<br/>\n1 large egg<br/>\n1 large egg yolk<br/>\n3 cups whole milk, heavy cream or half-and-half or a combination thereof<br/>\nFreshly grated nutmeg<br/>\n1/2 cup shredded Comt\u00e9, Emmanthaler or Swiss cheese</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place a medium saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, drain excess water from leeks, and add to pan.
