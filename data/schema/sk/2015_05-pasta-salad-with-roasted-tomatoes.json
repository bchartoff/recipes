Drizzle lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Bake in oven for approximately 90 minutes, until somewhat shriveled and dry to the touch, but not fully dehydrated. Set aside until needed, letting them cool. [Note, if you pine nuts are not yet toasted, you can place them in the oven for the last 10 minutes, shaking them once or twice for even coloring. Let cool as well before using.]</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Make dressing:</i> Roughly chop the garlic on a cutting board, then add oregano, salt and a few grinds of black pepper.

This is also perfect for picnics and potlucks, as it can handle being out in the sun without going south.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/05-pasta-salad-with-roasted-tomatoes"}
