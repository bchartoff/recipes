I swapped in my favorite quiche crust these days, which barely shrinks and manages to stay sturdy even without par-baking first. I made one large tart, rather than the 6 tartlets the original recipe called for, added more potatoes to compensate, and swapped tarragon (what I had on hand) for the suggested thyme and rosemary but think any herb you enjoy eating with potatoes and cheese would work.</p><p>One note: This is not a quiche. The filling will remain soft and custard-like after baked, not firm up like most egg fillings. I liked this texture; it was a little different but wanted to give a heads-up that the recipe hasn\u2019t gone wrong if your potatoes can still be nudged a little after baking.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 Savory Tart Shell, below, or recipe of your choice, in a 9-inch tart pan and ready to fill", "1 pound small red potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 large egg yolk", "1/4 pound blue cheese, crumbled (about 3/4 cup)", "1 tablespoons finely chopped herb or herbs of your choice, such as a mixture of thyme and rosemary", "Fine sea salt for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 Savory Tart Shell, below, or recipe of your choice, in a 9-inch tart pan and ready to fill<br/>\n1 pound small red potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/4-inch slices<br/>\n1 cup heavy cream<br/>\n1 large egg yolk<br/>\n1/4 pound blue cheese, crumbled (about 3/4 cup)<br/>\n1 tablespoons finely chopped herb or herbs of your choice, such as a mixture of thyme and rosemary<br/>\nFine sea salt for sprinkling</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.
