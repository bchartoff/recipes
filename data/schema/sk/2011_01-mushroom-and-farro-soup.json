Raise heat and add barley; saut\u00e9 until it begins to color (this didn\u2019t really happen for me, because the mushroom liquid was still sloshing about). Add broth, sherry and tomato paste. Scoop the porcinis out of their soaking liquid (hang onto the liquid) and finely chop them. Strain the soaking liquid to remove any grit and add both this liquid and the chopped porcinis to pot. Season with salt and pepper, and simmer for about 40 minutes, until grains area tender. Stir in sherry vinegar; adjust seasonings and serve.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/01-mushroom-and-farro-soup"}
