(Every cup of nuts will weight something different depending on size and how many are broken and nut meal is even more inconsistent as you can just pack and pack it, the weight getting higher and higher.) I don\u2019t want to mess this cake up for you with estimates. If you don\u2019t have a scale, please simply buy 1 pound (455 grams) and do your best to estimate what removing 1/16 would look like (picture: 1/4, then 1/4 of that removed).

Don\u2019t take your eyes off the pot as while you may be impatient for it to start browning, the period between the time the butter begins to take on color and the point where it burns is often less than a minute. As soon as the butter takes on a nutty color and smell, remove from heat and pour into a large bowl to cool.
