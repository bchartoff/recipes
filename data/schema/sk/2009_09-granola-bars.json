First, I decreased the sugar because, as I mentioned, I find most granola bars excessively sweet. Think you\u2019ll miss it? Stir in the 1/4 cup brown sugar I took out. I also removed the tablespoons of butter, as I\u2019m convinced that the oil component in most homemade granola recipes prohibits clumping. Of course I have yet to do a side-by-side test of this theory \u2014 this is the Smitten Kitchen, not America\u2019s Test Kitchen! \u2014 so if you think you\u2019ll miss the butter, stir in three tablespoons, melted.</p><p>Finally, if you\u2019re going to be a houseguest this holiday weekend \u2014 can I come, too? \u2014 I think these would make a spectacular hostess gift. Or, you know, something to tide you over until the rest of the house rouses for a late breakfast.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes 12 to 16 granola bars", "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups old-fashioned oatmeal", "1 cup sliced almonds", "1 cup shredded coconut, loosely packed (I used unsweetened)", "1/2 cup toasted wheat germ", "2/3 cup honey", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 cup dried fruit, or a mix of dried fruit (I used chopped apricots, cranberries and raisins)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2 cups old-fashioned oatmeal<br/>\n1 cup sliced almonds<br/>\n1 cup shredded coconut, loosely packed (I used unsweetened)<br/>\n1/2 cup toasted wheat germ<br/>\n2/3 cup honey<br/>\n1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>\n1 1/2 cup dried fruit, or a mix of dried fruit (I used chopped apricots, cranberries and raisins)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F.
