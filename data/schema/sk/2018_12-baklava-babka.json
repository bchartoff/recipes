I use a tube pan here; I have this one. (It\u2019s the same one I use for my mom\u2019s apple cake cake, if you\u2019re looking for more uses for it.) Flavor-wise, it hopefully goes without saying that baklava, depending on the place you like yours from and even sometimes the person who makes it, ranges in flavors and nut compositions. If you have a favorite flavor combination (maybe you hate cinnamon in it but love rose water), use it here, tweaking the below to your preferences. Below are mine. I also hope it goes without saying that baklava is a sweet dessert! However, I did my best to keep the sugar in check here and was told by everyone who tasted it not to reduce it further.

Dab last 1/2-inch (the edge furthest away from you) with water. Brush remainder of dough with melted butter. Sprinkle evenly with cinnamon sugar.

Lift one side over the next, forming a twist and trying to keep the cut sides facing up (because they\u2019re pretty). Don\u2019t worry if this step makes a mess, just transfer the twist as best as you can into the prepared pan or pans. (An extra spatula or set of hands can make this lifting easier.)
