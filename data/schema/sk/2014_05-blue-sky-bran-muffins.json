The book pairs books and literature, inviting bestselling authors to talk about the foods and recipes that inspired passages in their books. Jill Clement suggests the Blue Sky Bakery bran muffin as the ideal companion to her novel, Heroic Measures; in a pivotal scene, she has a character eat a bran muffin because she wants him to be wowed by the earthy flavors.</p><p>And these are not just any bran muffins. They\u2019re hefty and hearty, more whole grain than refined flour, barely sweet and you\u2019ll never get two muffins alike because the great big pocket of fruit in the center is variable; in just one week\u2019s time we had banana-coconut, mango-fresh cranberry, blackberry-apple and blueberry-raspberry. What should you put in yours? Anything that sounds good.</p><p>[Note: The original fruit level, 1 1/2 to 2 cups, was accidentally doubled.
