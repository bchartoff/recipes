Here, we use some jam, cinnamon-sugar, and a mix of chopped nuts, dried fruit and chocolate as the \u201ccoarse\u201d mix but you can swap this with 1 cup of whatever you\u2019d prefer. I use an egg wash for shine on top, but if eggs are an issue for you, brushing some cream over the top works too. In regards to the dough, I just want to underline that unlike pie crusts, puffed pastry or croissants, the flakiness here is not something it takes magic and/or advanced skill to create; you don\u2019t need to cut cold butter into flour, envelope, roll, or anything else. No matter how you blend it, the results will be incomparably flaky.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes 40 to 48 rugelach", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Dough</u>", "2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1/2 pound (225 grams) unsalted butter", "1/2 pound (1 8-ounce or 225-gram package) cream cheese", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "2/3 cup (135 grams) granulated sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon", "1/3 cup miniature chocolate chips or finely chopped bitter- or semi-sweet chocolate", "1/3 cup toasted nuts, chopped small (I used walnuts)", "1/3 cup dried fruit, chopped small; (I used tiny dried currants, no chopping needed)", "1/2 to 3/4 cup jam (I used seedless raspberry, apricot is more traditional)", "RECIPE_SUBHED__3<u>Finish</u>", "1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water or milk", "Remaining cinnamon-sugar from above"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Finish</u><br/>\n1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water or milk<br/>\nRemaining cinnamon-sugar from above</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make the dough:</u></p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><em>In a food processor:</em> Place flour and salt in work bowl fitted with standard blade.
