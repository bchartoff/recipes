I also found that I could only reliably get \u201ccrisp\u201d effect, one that lasted for a while, when I used an egg white instead of an olive oil wash. Please don\u2019t take any of the measurements in this recipe as the law; cooking times and required coating will vary by thickness and baking pan heaviness. You\u2019ll want to keep an eye on them and look for a good golden color before removing from the oven, which will ensure that they get and remain crisp.

Dip each zucchini coin in egg white, letting excess run off before gently dipping them in parmesan mixture. Arrange in single layer on baking sheets.
