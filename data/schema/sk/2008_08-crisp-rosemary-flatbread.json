I find the minced rosemary inside the cracker is sufficient to perfume the cracker without overwhelming it. Should you miss the original recipe, Epicurious has it. As I did in 2008, I do think this cracker could be good with other herbs, especially thyme, and/or a freshly ground black pepper.", "totalTime": "P0DT0H20M0S", "recipeYield": "3 large or 6 medium flatbreads", "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups (230 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon chopped rosemary plus 2 (6-inch) sprigs (optional)", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup (120 ml) water", "1/3 cup (80 ml) olive oil plus more for brushing", "Flaky sea salt such as Maldon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450\u00b0F with a heavy baking sheet on rack in middle.
