The realm of flourless cakes tends to be populated with brick-like truffle cakes but this one manages to be intensely chocolaty but also featherlight. They also tend to be flooded with butter and while you will never hear me complain about the presence of butter in a cake, the absence of it in this cake allows it to almost float away. We can\u2019t let that happen, so it is anchored it with the most minimal frosting we know, whipped cream. The cold sweet cream against the airy bittersweet cake is, as far as I\u2019m concerned, perfection itself. And it doesn\u2019t exactly hurt that the cake looks like a pinwheel. Or a Yodel. Or a Ho-Ho. You know, whatever your poison may be.</p><p>[Updated 5/9/11: To clarify some cake rolling confusion, pointed out by a helpful commenter. The prior directions had you roll the cake with a piece of waxed paper underneath, towel on top. In hindsight, the cake is much easier to roll with a towel underneath, as my photos show. Apologies to anyone who ended up with (delicious) cake chips because of this!]</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Cake layer:</u>", "6 ounces semisweet bittersweet chocolate, chopped or 1 cup semi- or bittersweet chocolate chips", "3 tablespoons water or strong coffee", "6 large eggs, at room temperature, separated", "2/3 cup sugar", "1/4 teaspoon table salt", "2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, divided", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling:</u>", "1 cup heavy or whipping cream", "2 to 3 tablespoons powdered sugar (use more if you prefer a sweeter filling)", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 to 2 tablespoons liqueur of your choice, such as Grand Marnier"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling:</u><br/>\n1 cup heavy or whipping cream<br/>\n2 to 3 tablespoons powdered sugar (use more if you prefer a sweeter filling)<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 to 2 tablespoons liqueur of your choice, such as Grand Marnier</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.

Sift one tablespoon cocoa over the top of the cake and cover the cake with a thin tea or flour sack towel [Updated, see Note above] that is a little longer than the pan. Place the back of a baking sheet or a large flat tray over the towel and invert the cake and paper onto it. Gently peel back the parchment or waxed paper that lined the pan. Sift the remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder over the top of the cake (that was, one minute ago, the underside). Using the towel underneath to help lift and roll the cake, roll the cake from short end to short end with the towel inside. Let cool completely, encased in its towel.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Once cool, beat heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla until it holds stiff peaks.

Now that The New York Times online archives are in better order, I was able to find the actual article my mother read on a June day the year before I was born promising that <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70F17F83E5E16738DDDA10894DE405B858BF1D3\">you couldn\u2019t go wrong if you made this heavenly chocolate dessert on Father\u2019s Day</a>. In this version, there are a bunch of minor changes, such as using coffee instead of water with the chocolate, vanilla extract in stead of Grand Marnier, and much less of it, more whipped cream filling (which I find unnecessary) but less sweetener in it (which I preferred) and the option to roll the cake from the short end, which my family always does. I prefer most of these original nuances, as that\u2019s the way my mother always made it, but give some hybrid suggestions above. Neither recipe origin recommends pre-rolling the cake with a towel, but I picked that tip up from various food blogs and find it essential in virtually eliminating cake cracks.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><b>Note:</b> There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/03/the-best-chocolate-cake-expletive-free/\">four-layered version of this cake</a> in the archives.  </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/04-heavenly-chocolate-cake-roll"}
