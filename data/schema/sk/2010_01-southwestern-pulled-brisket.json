Stir in water and pour the mixture over the brisket. Crush the tomatoes through your fingers into the slow cooker; add the tomato juices, chipotles, bay leaves, and molasses. Cover the cooker, set it on LOW, and cook the brisket until it pulls apart easily with a fork, about 8 to 10 hours. (The original recipe suggests 8 hours, but my mother-in-law, who makes wonderful brisket, says she cooks hers for 10. So I went with 10 and it was lovely, but feel free to check in on yours at 8 hours to determine if it needs more tenderizing.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>To serve, you\u2019ve got two options: Leave the meat in the slow cooker and use two forks to pull it apart and stir it evenly into the sauce; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

I strained the sauce (to remove the cooked-until-dead vegetables and bay leaves), chilled it so the fat would be easy to remove, then reheated and reseasoned it well, simmering it down (to about 2/3 the volume) to thicken it a bit. We poured it back over the brisket as we pulled it, and then, when we got where we were going, reheated the whole pan on low.   (You could also thicken the sauce without skimming the excess fat \u2014 there was actually not as much as I\u2019d anticipated.) </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Either way, I suspect you will be making this again sooner that you\u2019d anticipated.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><b>Don\u2019t have a slow cooker?</b> Fear not.
