Next time, in keeping with the shortcut vibe, I might just use Goya\u2019s canned black beans in sauce (which I\u2019ve confessed to loving more than once) instead of mashing a can with what seemed like not enough seasoning next time. And, with the minutes that would save, I\u2019d much rather use my favorite green onion and red cabbage slaw instead of the suggested one. If I felt like adding some extra protein, it would only take a couple additional minutes to saute some ground meat in a pan with onion and stir it into the beans \u2014 especially the saucier ones. But really, the possibilities are endless, so use the recipe as a loose guideline and have fun with it", "totalTime": "P0DT0H20M0S", "recipeYield": "2", "recipeIngredient": ["1 15-ounce can black beans, drained", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "5 teaspoons olive oil, divided", "2 tablespoons (or more) fresh lime juice", "2 cups shredded cabbage or packaged coleslaw mix", "2 green onions, thinly sliced", "1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "4 white or yellow corn tortillas", "1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese", "Hot sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place beans and cumin in small bowl; partially mash.
