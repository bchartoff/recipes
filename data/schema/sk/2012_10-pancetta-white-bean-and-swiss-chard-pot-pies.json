In fact, I went back and forth many, many times about removing it so that this could stay in the vegetarian section, but in the end, decided it easier I leave the choice to you. For a vegetarian version, simply skip the pancetta and cook your vegetables in 2 tablespoons olive oil instead of 1. You can replace the swiss chard with any green you have around, from a hearty spinach to kale, adjusting the cooking time accordingly to make sure it wilts a bit before going into the oven to finish cooking.</p><p>As you can see from the photos, I really don\u2019t own soup crocks. I have debated the value of purchasing some many times of the years, but you must trust me when I say I don\u2019t have room for a single extra dish I don\u2019t already own in my life right now. Instead, I just use two-cup bowls we already have that are ovenproof. (When buying a dish set, I always look to see if they are ovenproof, as you never know when this will come in handy.) If you don\u2019t have ovenproof soup bowls, you can always make a large version of this in a casserole dish with one big pastry lid. </p><p>Weekday night tip: Make a double batch of the stew and lids. Keep them separate and for two to three nights, you can ladle what you\u2019d like into bowls, roll out lids and bake them to order.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Lid</u>", "2 cups (250 grams) all- purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon table salt", "13 tablespoons (185 grams or 1 stick plus 5 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, diced", "6 tablespoons (90 grams) sour cream or whole Greek yogurt (i.e., a strained", "yogurt)", "1 tablespoon (15 ml) white wine vinegar", "1/4 cup (60 ml) ice water", "1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil", "4 ounces (115 grams or 3/4 to 1 cup) 1/4-inch-diced pancetta", "1 large or 2 small onions, finely chopped", "1 large carrot, finely chopped", "1 large stalk celery, finely chopped", "Pinch of red pepper flakes", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Thinly sliced Swiss chard leaves from an 8- to 10-ounce (225- to 285-gram)", "bundle (4 cups); if leaves are very wide, you can halve them lengthwise", "3 1/2 tablespoons (50 grams) butter", "3 1/2 tablespoons (25 grams) all- purpose flour", "3 1/2 cups (765 ml) sodium- free or low- sodium chicken or vegetable broth", "2 cups white beans, cooked and drained, or from one and a third 15.5- ounce", "(440-gram) cans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling</u><br/>\n2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil<br/>\n4 ounces (115 grams or 3/4 to 1 cup) 1/4-inch-diced pancetta<br/>\n1 large or 2 small onions, finely chopped<br/>\n1 large carrot, finely chopped<br/>\n1 large stalk celery, finely chopped<br/>\nPinch of red pepper flakes<br/>\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n2 garlic cloves, minced<br/>\nThinly sliced Swiss chard leaves from an 8- to 10-ounce (225- to 285-gram)<br/>\nbundle (4 cups); if leaves are very wide, you can halve them lengthwise<br/>\n3 1/2 tablespoons (50 grams) butter<br/>\n3 1/2 tablespoons (25 grams) all- purpose flour<br/>\n3 1/2 cups (765 ml) sodium- free or low- sodium chicken or vegetable broth<br/>\n2 cups white beans, cooked and drained, or from one and a third 15.5- ounce<br/>\n(440-gram) cans</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make lids:</u> In a large, wide bowl (preferably one that you can get your hands into), combine the fl our and salt.
