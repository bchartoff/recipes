Instead of making it in two 9-inch square pans, I baked it in a single 9\u00d713, which is closer to the size I think is fitting for a picnic or pot luck and less work. I 2/3-erd the cake portion, because I wanted it to be thin, skipped the vanilla (which I think can be occasionally clashy with rhubarb) and added a pinch of ginger (which I think goes wonderfully) but not so much that the cake is by any means \u201cgingery.\u201d I increased the baking powder as well, just a hair, because it seemed too little for the flour volume. I didn\u2019t scale down the rhubarb accordingly, but I did add lemon and reduce the sugar because I like it when rhubarb can still shine like its tart little self. I increased the crumb proportionally and I\u2019m glad I did because, really, you can never enough crumb (and once baked, it keeps that extra rhubarb from running right off the cake) and I added a pinch of cinnamon to the crumb because, yes, it\u2019s just happy there. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Cake</u>", "1 1/4 pound (565 grams) rhubarb, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch lengths on the diagonal", "1 1/3 cup (265 grams) granulated sugar, divided", "1 tablespoon lemon juice (psst, skip ahead and zest it for the cake before you cut it)", "1/2 cup (1 stick, 4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, softened", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "2 large eggs", "1 1/3 cups (165 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon table salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/3 cup (80 grams) sour cream", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Crumb</u>", "1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup (50 grams) light brown sugar", "1/8 teaspoon table salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick, 2 ounces, or 55 grams) unsalted butter, melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Crumb</u><br/>\n1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1/4 cup (50 grams) light brown sugar<br/>\n1/8 teaspoon table salt<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>\n4 tablespoons (1/2 stick, 2 ounces, or 55 grams) unsalted butter, melted</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Make the cake: Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F.
