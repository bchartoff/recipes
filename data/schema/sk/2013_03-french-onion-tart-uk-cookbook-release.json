Below is (roughly) the one recommended by Larousse Gastronomique. If you have a go-to crust that you love, feel free to use it here. If you can\u2019t be bothered making one, there\u2019s no shame in buying one at the store. I also tend to go back and forth on the value of par-baking crusts \u2014 if you blind bake them first, you will get a more crisp shell and deeper color in the end (if, uh, you bake it as long as I recommend below, and not for the shorter time that I did, because I wasn\u2019t paying attention). It\u2019s totally up to you if you feel this step is worth it; it still works if you put the filling in a raw pastry shell, it just stays a bit more pale.</p><p>Updated: Because several of you had issues with the quiche layers separating (into onions, eggs, then cheese), I\u2019ve altered the directions to have you cool the onions long enough that they won\u2019t scramble the eggs, then mix the egg custard and onions together before filling the shell. The prior method, spreading the onions in the bottom, then pouring over the custard, was to allow you to skip the cooling step. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Crust</u>", "2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon table salt", "1/2 cup (1 stick, 4 ounces or 113 grams) chilled butter, in cubes", "3 tablespoons cold water", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "1 1/2 pounds yellow onions (about 4 medium), halved and thinly sliced", "1 tablespoons butter", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Scant 1/2 teaspoon table salt", "Pinch of sugar", "1 cup low-sodium beef, veal or mushroom stock/broth", "2 teaspoons cognac, brandy or vermouth (optional)", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup (about 2 ounces or 60 grams) grated Gruyere, Comte or Swiss cheese", "1 large egg", "1/2 cup heavy cream (half-and-half and milk work too, but cream tastes best)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling</u><br/>\n1 1/2 pounds yellow onions (about 4 medium), halved and thinly sliced<br/>\n1 tablespoons butter<br/>\n1 tablespoon olive oil<br/>\nScant 1/2 teaspoon table salt<br/>\nPinch of sugar<br/>\n1 cup low-sodium beef, veal or mushroom stock/broth<br/>\n2 teaspoons cognac, brandy or vermouth (optional)<br/>\nFreshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1/2 cup (about 2 ounces or 60 grams) grated Gruyere, Comte or Swiss cheese<br/>\n1 large egg<br/>\n1/2 cup heavy cream (half-and-half and milk work too, but cream tastes best)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make crust:</u> Mix flour and salt together in a large bowl or the work bowl of a food processor.

Pour in cognac, if using it, and the stock, then turn the heat all the way up and scrape up any brown bits stuck to the pan. Simmer the mixture until the broth nearly completely disappears (wetter onions will make for a wetter quiche), about 5 to 10 minutes. Adjust the salt, if needed, and season with freshly ground black pepper. [Updated to add.] Let cool until warm.
