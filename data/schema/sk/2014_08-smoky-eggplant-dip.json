I like a lot of smoky char, tahini and lemon; I try not to overwhelm it with minced garlic, which gets much stronger after a day in the fridge. I like using olive oil to finish it, but not in the dip; I like parsley both mixed in and on top. A scattering of za\u2019atar or toasted sesame seeds and sea salt are wonderful on top. Feel free to use this as a starter recipe and cooking technique, then tweak it to your tastes.</p><p>Finally, about the texture. So besotted I am with my new blender, I used it, but distracted, took David\u2019s instructions quite literally to \u201cblend until smooth\u201d on Saturday night and within ten seconds, had made ba-ba-baby food. Which my friends, polite as they were, ate anyway. The next time I made it, photographed here, I just pulsed the mixture in little bursts, but it still became a touch too smooth for my tastes. Want to know what I\u2019ll do from this day forward? Hand chop it. My mother-in-law does this with her eggplant caviar, and it\u2019s the only way ensure that you get a lovely texture that\u2019s not overly pureed. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes about 2 cups", "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium eggplants (about 1 pound each)", "2 tablespoons olive oil, divided", "1 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt, or to taste", "6 tablespoons tahini (sesame seed paste), well-stirred if a new container", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced or pressed", "Juice of 1 lemon, plus more to taste, if desired", "Pinch of cayenne or aleppo pepper", "Pinch or two of ground cumin", "2 tablespoons well-chopped flat-leaf parsley, divided", "Toasted sesame seeds or za\u2019atar for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2 medium eggplants (about 1 pound each)<br/>\n2 tablespoons olive oil, divided<br/>\n1 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt, or to taste<br/>\n6 tablespoons tahini (sesame seed paste), well-stirred if a new container<br/>\n2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced or pressed<br/>\nJuice of 1 lemon, plus more to taste, if desired<br/>\nPinch of cayenne or aleppo pepper<br/>\nPinch or two of ground cumin<br/>\n2 tablespoons well-chopped flat-leaf parsley, divided<br/>\nToasted sesame seeds or za\u2019atar for garnish</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 375\u00b0F.
