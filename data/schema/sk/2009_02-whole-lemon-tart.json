I\u2019ve also drastically streamlined the directions \u2014 the whole tart is now made in the food processor, as I always have at home. The butter doesn\u2019t need to be softened or melted. You\u2019ll have the filling made and the tart out of the oven in 45 minutes. This is the perfect dessert to bring to a dinner party. [One final tip, 8/21/14] When I used a riff on this filling for the Whole Lemon Bars in my cookbook, I found over dozens of obsessive retests that the only times that the filling came out too bitter was when the white part of the lemons I\u2019d bought were especially thick. I\u2019ve adjusted the directions below to have you take a look at your peel thickness when you cut it, and to use less skin if it\u2019s especially thick.  </p><p>1 partially baked 9-inch Great Unshrinkable Tart Shell, or your favorite sweet tart shell</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 average-sized lemon (about 4 1/2 ounces; 130 grams), rinsed and dried*", "1 1/2 cups (300 grams) sugar", "1 stick (4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks", "4 large eggs", "2 tablespoons (14 grams) cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon table salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 average-sized lemon (about 4 1/2 ounces; 130 grams), rinsed and dried*<br/>\n1 1/2 cups (300 grams) sugar<br/>\n1 stick (4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks<br/>\n4 large eggs<br/>\n2 tablespoons (14 grams) cornstarch<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon table salt</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).
