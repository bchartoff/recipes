As most of us have 2 cake pans, at best, you could also make it into two thicker cake layers, giving it a little more baking time. Or, you could do as I did, which is to hold the last bit of batter in a bowl until the first layer comes out and can be unmolded. It holds up just fine at room temperature for an hour. You\u2019ll have up to 1 cup more whipped cream than you\u2019ll need; you can make a little less or just keep the rest in a jar for another dessert. The cream stays stable due to the added mascarpone, although that was my preference and creme fraiche or sour cream are usually what\u2019s recommended. (Read more about why here.) Finally, the sugared cranberries are something I auditioned at the last minute for the first time so I\u2019m hardly an expert (but hope to be, in two or three bags); you\u2019ll want to start them the night or day before. You\u2019ll have way more than you\u2019ll need; the rest make pretty gifts, festive treats or can be scattered on plates when serving.", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Sugared Cranberries</u>", "1 cup (200 grams) plus 1/3 cup (65 grams) granulated sugar", "1 cup water", "1 cup (100 grams) fresh cranberries ", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Cake layers</u>", "1 cup (235 ml) oatmeal stout or Guinness Stout", "1 cup (235 ml) dark molasses (ideally, not blackstrap)", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "3 large eggs", "1 cup (190 grams) packed dark brown sugar", "1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar", "3/4 cup (150 grams) vegetable or another neutral oil", "2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "2 tablespoons ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Pinch of ground cardamom", "RECIPE_SUBHED__3<u>Filling</u>", "2 cups (475 ml) heavy or whipping cream", "6 tablespoons (45 grams) powdered sugar", "1/2 cup (115 grams) mascarpone"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling</u><br/>\n2 cups (475 ml) heavy or whipping cream<br/>\n6 tablespoons (45 grams) powdered sugar<br/>\n1/2 cup (115 grams) mascarpone</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make sugared cranberries:</u> Bring 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup water to a gentle simmer (not a full boil) on the stove, stirring until sugar has dissolved.
