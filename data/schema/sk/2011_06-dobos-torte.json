With more focus, I believe it can be done in 3 hours. With good planning and the rev of a strong cup of coffee, I suspect it could be pulled off in 2 hours, but hardly think that would be much fun.</p><p>Notes: This dobos torte, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is rare among really showy cakes in that it tastes even awesomer than it looks, and that days later, its as good if not better than it was the first day it was made. Personally, I always pause before making sponge cakes, and they can be a little dry and a bit dull. But this one, with an insanely buttery dark chocolate frosting sandwiching it\u2019s pancake-like layers, manages to be neither, and has a softness you wouldn\u2019t expect from something that slices so neatly. In the fridge, that shell-like chocolate exterior locks in the moisture for days. </p><p>I detoured from tradition in a few ways. First, I made more layers than the requisite 7. You\u2019re welcome to make your cake layers as thin as you can bake them up, as most pastry chefs enjoy challenging themselves to. You can double or quadruple the cake recipe and make a staggering stack of a cake, too. 35 for a 35th birthday, anyone?</p><p>I also made the cake rectangular as this was how I remembered it most fondly, and allowed me to minimize my baking and fussing. Although round cakes are more traditional, I felt extra validated by my choice when I consulted George Lang\u2019s The Cuisine of Hungary and found that he, too, advised a squared-off cake and the least fussy baking approach. If you have an oven that fits a 12\u00d717-inch pan (mine, alas, does not) you can bake this entire cake in 5 minutes, and divide the layer in a 6-high cake.</p><p>Here are some shaping/stacking options. For each, you can make additional layers if you feel comfortable baking your cake layers thinner:</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "A 7-layer 9-inch round cake (the most traditional)\nA 14-layer 6-inch round (would serve fewer people but have tall, showy slices)\nA 12-layer 4\u00d78-inch cake (my method, baked in 4 quarter-sheet pans, each divided into thirds)\nA 6-layer 4\u00d78.5-inch cake (the more traditional rectangle, baked in a single 12\u00d717-inch sheet pan)", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Cake layers:</u>", "7 large eggs, separated", "3 large egg yolks", "1 pound (3 1/2 cups or 455 grams) confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus extra for dusting racks", "3/4 cup (94 grams or 3 1/3 ounces) all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1/8 teaspoon table salt", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Frosting and filling:</u>", "1/2 pound (8 ounces or 227 grams) semi- or bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped", "1/2 pound (2 sticks or 226 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 large egg yolks", "2 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "RECIPE_SUBHED__3<u>Caramel layer (optional)</u>", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon water", "Handful of toasted, peeled hazelnuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Caramel layer (optional)</u><br/>\n1/2 cup granulated sugar<br/>\n1 tablespoon water<br/>\nHandful of toasted, peeled hazelnuts</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Prepare your cake pans:</u> Choose a cake size and shape option from the Notes, above. Assemble either the cake pans you will need, or sheets of parchment paper if you don\u2019t have all the necessary pans. If using cake pans, line the bottom of each with a sheet of fitted parchment paper, and butter and flour (or use a butter-flour spray) the parchment and sides of the pan. Tap out excess flour, if needed. If using sheets of parchment paper, cut each larger than needed for the cake shape and size. Stencil your cake shape on one side of the sheet, then flip it over and butter and flour the shape area on the reverse side. Again, tap out any excess flour.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat 10 egg yolks for a few minutes at high speed, until pale and lemon-colored. Reduce speed and gradually add sugar, then increase the speed and beat the yolks and sugar until thick and glossy. Scrape bowl occasionally with rubber spatula. Reduce speed again and gradually add flour and salt; increase speed mix for 5 minutes more, then mix in lemon juice. Scrape bowl again with a rubber spatula. In a separate bowl with cleaned beaters, or by transferring your cake batter to a new bowl and washing it out and drying it with a long sigh, beat the 7 egg whites with a whisk attachment until they hold stiff peaks. Because your yolk mixture is more or less the thickness of spackle at this point, stir a few heaping spoonfuls of the whites into it to loosen the mixture, before folding in the rest of the whites in three additions. When you\u2019re done, your batter will have transformed from a dry paste to a spreadable, foamy batter.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Bake your cake layers:</u> Spread your batter in prepared pans or within their stenciled shapes on parchment paper; try to push the batter rather than pull it with an offset spatula, it will help keep the parchment from rolling up. Don\u2019t worry if they spread past the shape outline on parchment; you will trim them later. If you have a digital scale and want to be super-fussy about making sure the layers are even, weighing the batter and dividing it out accordingly will do the trick. [I can make it even easier; the net weight of my batter was 985 grams.] If not and you\u2019re aiming for a traditional 7-layer 9-inch round cake, spread batter to about 1/4-inch thickness in each circle. Spread the batter evenly to the edges with an offset spatula; be careful not to leave any holes.
