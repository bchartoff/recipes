I looked at every recipe that I could find for them and rejected each on different accounts. (Those that had reviews were never reviewed well.) I finally started reverse engineering my old fallback, the one-bowl brownies I\u2019ve been making since grade school that despite their absence of browned butter, imported chocolate, Dutched cocoa and paragraphs of direction, are really spectacular. I increased the chocolate, knowing that the flavor of white chocolate is hard to find in confections, even in larger quantities and top qualities. I decreased the sugar. I increased the thickness, just a tad.  But I left the important part there, that it\u2019s a one-bowl brownie, something that\u2019s doubly important because you\u2019ll be making two batches. Two bowls; we can manage that, right?</p><p>I\u2019m not going to call this the best brownie I\u2019ve ever made \u2014 in fact, I was so convinced that it wouldn\u2019t work, I didn\u2019t even take photos of the process of making them \u2014 but it exceeded my expectations. They\u2019re chewy, their sweetness is not completely out of control and they each taste enough like their primary ingredient to earn their titles. But? They\u2019re so much better in the context (or as the belly button) of their darker brownie compatriots. Also, cuter.

Still cold (and if they warm up and soften too quickly, pop them back in the freezer for 5 minutes), carefully, slowly, gently, press your cookie cutter into the center of each brownie and set the cut-out aside.
