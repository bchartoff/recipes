Maybe predictably by now, most sticky buns haven\u2019t held my interest for long because they were so assaulting in their sweetness, I feared my teeth would exit my gums in protest. What I always wanted, and what I\u2019m striving for here, is more of a contrast. We\u2019re going to be abstemious everywhere \u2014 holding back on the sugar in the dough itself, the cinnamon-sugar filling and pretty much everything that isn\u2019t kale slaw the day we make these \u2014 so that we can be completely unapologetically obscenely decadent with the amount of pecan goo we drench the final buns in. This caramel is everything I am always hoping I\u2019ll find at the end of a sticky bun: dark with brown sugar and honey, stretched and enriched with cream and butter and balanced with just enough salt and deeply toasted pecans that there will be no other recipe for me, ever. This is where the sticky bun studies stop. </p><p>Note: I used this same dough recipe in the Cranberry Orange Breakfast Buns, but here, I tested it with both kinds of readily available yeast; both work wonderfully, with a few adjustments, noted within the recipe. In short: active dry yeast needs to be proofed for 5 minutes before you begin, but it completes the first rise in half the time. These can be made in one day/afternoon or you can overnight them for the last rise. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "12 buns.
