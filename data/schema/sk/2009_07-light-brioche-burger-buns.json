Add butter and rub into flour between your fingers, making crumbs. Using a dough scraper, stir in yeast mixture and beaten egg until a dough forms. Scrape dough onto clean, well-floured counter and knead, scooping dough up, slapping it on counter and turning it, until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. The dough will be on the sticky side so it can be a bit messy, but keep in mind that the more flour you knead in, the tougher the buns will get. Try to leave them tackier than you would a round loaf.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>3. Shape dough into a ball and return it to bowl.

Set a large shallow pan of water on oven floor. Preheat oven to 400 degrees with rack in center. Beat remaining egg with one tablespoon water and brush some on top of buns.

Transfer to a rack to cool completely.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/07-light-brioche-burger-buns"}
