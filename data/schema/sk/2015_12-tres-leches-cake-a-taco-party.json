While sponge cakes can be made with or without butter, the butter-free ones that might be less enjoyable to eat plain (see: spongy and butterless) are perfect here because they drink the milks and become, IMHO, the highest calling of a sponge cake. Although tres leches cakes are supposed to be very sweet \u2014 it is tradition! \u2014 I cannot resist dialing back the sugar in the cake just a little. My two other tweaks are optional; if you have a fresh vanilla bean around, it\u2019s exceptional in here. And, when I\u2019m making this cake for a grown-up dinner party, I love adding 1 to 2 tablespoons dark rum to the three mix mixture. Want to fiddle even more with tradition? Replace the cream with coconut milk or eggnog, for a holiday riff. Some people like to add a little cinnamon or nutmeg to the whipped topping, but I never do.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["Butter and flour for cake pan", "1 3/4 cups (230 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup (30 grams) cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "6 large eggs, separated", "1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped from pods or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 1/4 cups (250 grams) granulated sugar", "1/4 cup (60 ml) whole milk", "1 (12-ounce or 340 grams) can evaporated milk", "1 (14-ounce or 400 grams) can sweetened condensed milk", "1 1/2 cups (355 ml) heavy or light cream (half-and-half)", "1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) rum (optional)", "2 cups (475 ml) heavy cream (for whipped topping)", "2 tablespoons (15 grams) powdered or granulated sugar (for whipped topping)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Butter and flour for cake pan<br/>\n1 3/4 cups (230 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1/4 cup (30 grams) cornstarch<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br/>\n2 teaspoons baking powder<br/>\n6 large eggs, separated<br/>\n1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped from pods or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br/>\n1 1/4 cups (250 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\n1/4 cup (60 ml) whole milk<br/>\n1 (12-ounce or 340 grams) can evaporated milk<br/>\n1 (14-ounce or 400 grams) can sweetened condensed milk<br/>\n1 1/2 cups (355 ml) heavy or light cream (half-and-half)<br/>\n1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) rum (optional)<br/>\n2 cups (475 ml) heavy cream (for whipped topping)<br/>\n2 tablespoons (15 grams) powdered or granulated sugar (for whipped topping)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
