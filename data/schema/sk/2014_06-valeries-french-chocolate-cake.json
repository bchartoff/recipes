I\u2019ve made it more intense, moist and more bittersweet. But I kept my favorite part: the incredible crumb and texture that comes from folding egg whites into this cake. Whipped egg whites are used to make meringues; meringues are weightless in the center and crisp-shattery at the edges \u2014 without them, this would be a flourless chocolate truffle cake with a bit more structure; with them folded in, this cake becomes airy and decadent, with a lid you can tap on.</p><p>In case you think you\u2019d prefer the original: Valerie uses semisweet chocolate here (55 to 60%), I use bittersweet (70 to 72%). I dropped the flour from 1 cup (125 grams) to 2/3 cup (85 grams) and replaced half with dark cocoa powder. I reduced the baking powder to keep it in line with the new flour level, and dropped the sugar a little too, from 1 1/4 cups (250 grams) to 1 cup (200). The result is a bittersweet (but not aggressively so) and featherlight chocolate cake. If you think you\u2019d prefer it sweeter, use an additional 1/4 cup sugar.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 generously, 16 if you, like us, prefer slim wedges of rich cake", "recipeIngredient": ["9 tablespoons (125 grams) unsalted butter", "7 ounces (200 grams) bittersweet (70/72 percent) chocolate, chopped", "3 tablespoons water", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/3 cup (40 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup (about 30 grams) dark cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy (Dutched or natural will work here; I use Dutched)", "4 large eggs, separated", "1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)", "Two pinches sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>9 tablespoons (125 grams) unsalted butter<br/>\n7 ounces (200 grams) bittersweet (70/72 percent) chocolate, chopped<br/>\n3 tablespoons water<br/>\n3/4 teaspoon baking powder<br/>\n1/3 cup (40 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1/3 cup (about 30 grams) dark cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy (Dutched or natural will work here; I use Dutched)<br/>\n4 large eggs, separated<br/>\n1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)<br/>\nTwo pinches sea salt</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 350 degrees.
