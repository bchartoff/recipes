I personally prefer a cold brine on certain foods, not wanting to wilt the fresh fruit, so I cool the brine completely before pouring it over. The former will yield a more tender pickle, and it will pick up the brine\u2019s flavor faster. The latter will take a bit longer to souse, but the grapes will stay more firm. Both will be delicious.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Once cool, chill the grape and brine mixture in their jars in the refrigerator for at least eight hours or overnight.
