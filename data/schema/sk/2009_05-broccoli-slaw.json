My favorite way to prep the stems is to peel them \u2014 the tough skin is why most people think they don\u2019t like broccoli stems; the broccoli underneath is juicy and crisp \u2014 then use the mandoline or a knife to cut them into thin slices.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Toss the sliced broccoli with the almonds, cranberries and red onion in a large bowl.
