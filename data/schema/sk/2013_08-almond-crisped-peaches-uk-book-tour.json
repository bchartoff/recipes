I came so close to following it exactly, and then couldn\u2019t resist adding 1/4 cup rolled oats, a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of sea salt, because I love all three so much in crisps. Consider it optional; the recipe works with or without them. Without them, the topping is more butter and brittle-like after baking; with them, it is still buttery and brittle-like, but with a little more of a traditional crisp texture and flavor. Both are magical; the peaches are barely sweet and taste fantastic with a dollop of creme fraiche or softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream on top. As for fruit, you could use peaches or nectarines with roughly the same cooking time, or try it with plums or apricots, or all soon, apples and pears. Feel free to try other nuts, too, any kind that you enjoy with baked fruit.</p><p>Slater recommends bakers sugar, which is sold in the U.S. as superfine sugar. I couldn\u2019t resist going in the opposite direction, using coarse raw sugar (turbinado, often sold as Sugar in the Raw here) instead. Regular granulated sugar works as well. I didn\u2019t try it with brown sugar, and suspect it may be delicious, but will not be certain until one of you report back (hint) how it holds up in the long baking time, hopefully not over-browning.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["4 ripe peaches", "1/3 cup (55 grams) whole almonds", "1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar", "3 tablespoons (45 grams) cold unsalted butter, cubed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>4 ripe peaches<br/>\n1/3 cup (55 grams) whole almonds<br/>\n1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar<br/>\n3 tablespoons (45 grams) cold unsalted butter, cubed</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Optional extras: 1/4 cup (20 grams) rolled oats, 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon, pinch of sea salt</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 350 degrees.
