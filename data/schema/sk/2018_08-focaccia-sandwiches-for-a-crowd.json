Add the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the water is absorbed and the ingredients form a loose, sticky dough. Cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap and [choose your schedule]:Quickest rise: Set aside in a warmish spot for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled.Overnight in fridge: Set inside your refrigerator overnight, about 8 to 10 hours.Overnight at room temperature: For this method, you will need to use only cold, no lukewarm, water. Leave the bowl on your counter at room temperature for 10 hours.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to make your focaccia: Pour 3 tablespoons oil onto a rimmed sheet pan (can use a 13\u00d718, or half-sheet pan, but if you have something more 11\u00d717-ish, as I use here, will make for slightly thicker loaf; you can line it first with parchment paper for maximum nonstick security).\nHeat oven to 425\u00b0F.\nUsing two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Use the forks to lift the dough onto the prepared sheet pan. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over.\nLet dough rest for 20 minutes (for Quickest rise or Overnight at room temperature) or 1 hour (if you used the Overnight in the fridge rise, so it warms up) without touching it. Then, drizzle last 1 tablespoon of olive oil over and use your fingertips to stretch and press the dough to the edges, leaving it intentionally dimply. If your dough resists being stretched all the way, get it as stretched as you can, wait 5 minutes, and return to stretch it the rest of the way, repeating this rest if needed.\nSprinkle with flaky sea salt all over and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, checking in on the earlier end, until lightly puffed on top and golden and crisp underneath. Remove from oven and let cool completely (this will go faster if you transfer the bread to a cooling rack) before assembling sandwiches.\nTo make sandwiches: If you\u2019d like, you can trim off the very outer edges \u2014 this exposes the crumb and makes it a little easier to halve. (I didn\u2019t do this because I like to make things hard, also I like edges.) Stafford recommends you begin the halving process by cutting through each corner, then running the serrated knife through the short end until you get to the midway point, then starting from the other short end until I get to the midway point. A sharp, serrated knife is helpful. Try to keep your knife as parallel to the bread as possible. She says she finds if she hugs the top layer as opposed to aiming for the center, she gets a more even cut.\nSome ideas for sandwich fillings:Avocado + Crispy Kale [Shown]:"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When you\u2019re ready to make your focaccia: Pour 3 tablespoons oil onto a rimmed sheet pan (can use a 13\u00d718, or half-sheet pan, but if you have something more 11\u00d717-ish, as I use here, will make for slightly thicker loaf; you can line it first with parchment paper for maximum nonstick security).\nHeat oven to 425\u00b0F.\nUsing two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center.
