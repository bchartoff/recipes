She gives no schedule for this (what if your kid lets you sleep in?!) and doesn\u2019t even give mention to the whole won\u2019t-the-milk-go-bad? thing. I \u2014 no surprise \u2014 am a little more panicky about what\u2019s unsaid in recipes. I made it the first time as she instructs. Oh man, it looks FUNKY in the morning, and the smell, well\u2026 How could it be right? I made it a second time, letting it overnight in the fridge, as many writers have interpreted since. Here\u2019s what you need to know: both work but the one that fermented at room temperature came in miles ahead in the flavor category. It had an unmistakeable sourdough (yeah, I know, not the word you want to hear about room temperature milk baked goods) vibe. I became instantly obsessed with the flavor. The flavor from the fridge batch was excellent, but no comparison. Proceed as you wish (both methods are tested and work) but do please consider the original room temperature method. It\u2019s just better.</p><p>And if you\u2019re not yet convinced that you need to make these, consider this: They\u2019re patient (you could sleep a little or a lot, the batter will still be ready for you in the morning.) They\u2019re easy, and use ingredients you probably already have around. The batter keeps in the fridge for days, extra waffles can be frozen and reheated in a toaster and just-cooked ones stay warm and crisp in a low oven for as long as it takes for everyone else to straggle in. Oh, and they taste like the greatest thing since gridded breakfast bread.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Marion Cunningham says 8 waffles, but waffle irons vary widely by volume; I felt it made a whole lot, enough to serve 4 to 6.

I bought it last year when I was working on a story about breakfast egg sandwiches (which I just realized never ran, hmm) and I wanted to make one with waffles. I honestly do not care for it or any waffle iron I\u2019ve ever owned for one reason, a reason that makes me a little shouty: <i>why don\u2019t waffles irons have removable plates for washing?!</i> I have yet to see one and cleaning them is such an ordeal; this is the only waffle recipe I\u2019ve loved enough that it has felt worth the bother.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2013/05-essential-raised-waffles"}
