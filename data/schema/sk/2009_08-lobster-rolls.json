However, not all markets are as trustworthy when it comes to lobster meat that they label \u201cfresh\u201d \u2014 it is often overcooked and not as recently-rendered as they promise. If you\u2019re up for it, cooking and cracking your own will ensure freshness while reducing your grocery tab. About 20 percent of the weight of a lobster is its meat, so you would need, for example, five one-pound lobsters to get one pound of meat. Don\u2019t panic \u2014 as I did \u2014 when you see how tiny the mass of two pounds of lobster meat might look. Once diced, our salad nearly filled a six-cup bowl.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/08-lobster-rolls"}
