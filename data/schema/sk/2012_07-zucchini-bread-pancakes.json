Everyone wins, right?</p><p>I keep the sugar level really low in pancakes because we love a sweet topping on ours, and I love the contrast between unsweetened and sweet in any baked good.

Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook another minute or two, until golden underneath. Transfer pancakes to prepared pan to keep warm as well as ensure that they\u2019re all cooked through when they\u2019re served. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm. Repeat next weekend.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/07-zucchini-bread-pancakes"}
