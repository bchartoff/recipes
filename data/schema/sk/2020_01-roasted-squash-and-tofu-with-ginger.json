The first is one that a dear reader has been pressing (get it? sorry) me/us to try for years: freezing it. You can freeze your tofu as soon as you get it home, still in the package, or already drained. Once defrosted, it easily shakes off all of its water (you\u2019ll want to blot it though) and even has a lovely texture. But, this requires a little more planning. 2. The second is a little faster, but some say less effective: place your block of on a few layers of paper towel with more towels over it (and even a tray or plate on top to weight it) and to set aside for 5 minutes, or until needed.
