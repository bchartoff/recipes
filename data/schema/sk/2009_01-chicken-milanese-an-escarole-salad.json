This dish is a perfect pairing and every guest cleaned their plate.</p><p>A note on doubling the recipe (as we did): I found I had way more battering station stuff than I needed for a doubled recipe. I know that a certain amount of extra is necessary to be able to generously dip the chicken, but when doubled, I ended up throwing way too much away to be comfortable with. Try 1.5-ing the egg batter, flour and bread crumb mixture instead, and see if it is enough. You can always add more.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>For the Pickled Onions: </u>", "1/2 cup red wine vinegar (I swapped half with white vinegar; I was feeling stingy with my fancy red wine stuff)", "1/2 cup cold water", "", "<s>2</s>", " tablespoons kosher salt (updated: 1 heaped tablespoon is a better amount here)", "1 tablespoon sugar", "2 to 3 really good shots hot sauce", "1 red onion, sliced into very thin rings", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>For the Chicken Milanese: </u>", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "2 eggs, beaten with 1 tablespoon of water", "1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs", "1/2 cup grated pamesan", "4 small boneless, skinless chicken breasts, butterflied and lightly pounded/flattened (no need to tenderize; a good organic chicken breast will already be tender, says Burrell) to 1/4-inch thick*", "Kosher salt and pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for frying", "RECIPE_SUBHED__3<u>For the Escarole Salad:</u>", "1/2 cup grated pecorino romano", "1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts", "2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves", "1 head escarole, washed, spun dry, cut into bite size pieces", "High-quality extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>For the Escarole Salad:</u><br/>\n1/2 cup grated pecorino romano<br/>\n1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts<br/>\n2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves<br/>\n1 head escarole, washed, spun dry, cut into bite size pieces<br/>\nHigh-quality extra-virgin olive oil</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make the pickled red onions:</u> In a small bowl, combine red wine vinegar with 1/2 cup of cold tap water.

When the oil is hot, test it again by dipping the edge of a piece of chicken into the oil, the oil should gently sizzle. Cook the chicken in the oil in batches on both sides until it is a lovely golden brown color and is crispy, about four to five minutes on the first side and three to four minutes on the second. Do not crowd the pan or the chicken will become very greasy and soggy. When the chicken comes out of the oil lay it on paper towels to drain off the excess oil and sprinkle with salt. [Do ahead: You can keep the chicken in a low oven to keep it warm while the rest of the chicken is cooking. I did this to hold it until we were ready to eat.]</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make the escarole salad:</u> Combine the romano, hazelnuts and parsley in the food processor and pulse until they are coarsely chopped.
