Some used only cinnamon (and a full tablespoon of it) to spice the filling, a few, but not many, others used several \u201capple pie spices\u201d including ground ginger, nutmeg and more. All used raisins. Some plumped them first in brandy or rum but I never did, figuring they\u2019d get plumped with spiced juices from the apples, a delicious thought. Many used 1 tablespoon vanilla-scented \u201ccustard powder\u201d (an ingredient less common in the US) as a thickener (a mix of cornstarch and vanilla sugar would have a similar effect) but most others sprinkled the bottom crust with only plain breadcrumbs and one, semolina, to absorbed juices, something that fascinated me as controlling the juices in pies is a bit of an American pie-making obsessed.
