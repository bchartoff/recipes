Although I\u2019m still fond of Molly\u2019s, I think this update benefits from streamlined directions and longer cooking times; I\u2019ve also found that I prefer the puffed pastry base to the short pastry one I believed I preferred then. Finally, her base is a salted caramel, from salted butter and if that sounds good to you, go ahead and use salted butter or a couple pinches of sea salt in this version.</p><p>If you don\u2019t have an ovenproof skillet, feel free to cook the apples on the stove and transfer them to a 9-inch round baking dish, along with all of their caramel before topping them with the pastry and baking them in the dish. Invert as you would the skillet.</p><p>Note: In the photos above, I made a 3/4-size version in a 7ish inch skillet. The recipe below is for a full-sized tatin, as you\u2019ll hopefully only have to make it once to get it right.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["6 medium apples (I had the most success with Golden Delicious and Granny Smiths)", "Juice of half a lemon", "6 tablespoons (3 ounces or 85 grams) butter", "1 1/3 cup (266 grams) sugar, divided", "Puffed pastry, chilled", "A 9-inch ovenproof skillet, heavy enough that you fear dropping it on your toes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>6 medium apples (I had the most success with Golden Delicious and Granny Smiths)<br/>\nJuice of half a lemon<br/>\n6 tablespoons (3 ounces or 85 grams) butter<br/>\n1 1/3 cup (266 grams) sugar, divided<br/>\nPuffed pastry, chilled<br/>\nA 9-inch ovenproof skillet, heavy enough that you fear dropping it on your toes</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Peel apples, halve and core apples.
