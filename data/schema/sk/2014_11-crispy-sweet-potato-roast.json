I used a 2-quart oval baking dish and needed 5 pounds of smallish sweet potatoes to fill it. If yours are smaller or thinner, you might need fewer pounds. If yours are thicker, you might want to safely buy 6 pounds. It seems safest to buy a little extra, just in case. Mine baked in an hour, but thicker-sliced potatoes could take up to 15 minutes longer. You can absolutely make this ahead of time. It will warm well wherever you go. It can be made up to two days in advance, and still taste as good as day one. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter, melted", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "Coarse salt and black pepper or red pepper flakes to taste", "5 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced thin", "2 shallots, peeled and sliced thin"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>3 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter, melted<br/>\n3 tablespoons olive oil<br/>\nCoarse salt and black pepper or red pepper flakes to taste<br/>\n5 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced thin<br/>\n2 shallots, peeled and sliced thin</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).
