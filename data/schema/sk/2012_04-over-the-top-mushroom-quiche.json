I used a smaller mix of the two, plus a pound of cremini (or baby portobello) mushrooms. Use whatever you\u2019ve got around. I insist that while a large mix mushrooms are wonderful to cook with, you can get plenty of delicious flavor in this quiche from any everyday mushrooms you can get at a good price.</p><p>He also recommends that you use 2 cups milk and 2 cups heavy cream. I did this, but have made many quiche successes in the past with all milk, some milk and some half-and-half, or just a higher proportion of milk (say, 3 cups) to heavy cream (i.e. 1 cup).</p><p>To par-bake or not to par-bake: Par-baking tart shells is, honestly, my least favorite cooking task. I would rather empty the dishwasher twice in an afternoon. However, doing so ensures a more crisp, browned crust. If you\u2019re not overly concerned about this, you can skip this step and just pour the filling into the chilled unbaked shell. If you\u2019d like to go the extra mile, the directions are included. Warning: A 9-inch pastry ring holds 15 cups of filling. You will need 15 cups of pie weights, dried beans or rice (that you don\u2019t wish to cook later, as the toasting will make them take forever to cook) or pennies/loose change. I used a canister of old rice and pie weights and still came up an inch short.</p><p>Update 4/12/12: After reading a few comments about the softness of the quiche, I realize it would have been helpful to mention at the outset that this quiche is a bit softer and creamier than most. Keller says he prefers his that way. It\u2019s likely to be less sturdy than many of us are used to. For example, in the two Julia Child quiche recipes I know, the proportion of milk/cream/dairy to the same number of eggs (6) would be anywhere from 2 to 3 cups, not 4. So, if you\u2019re concerned you may not like a softer quiche, you can add another egg or even two to it. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Buttery Pastry Shell</u>", "2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup (2 sicks or 225 grams) very cold unsalted butter, cut into a small dice", "1/4 cup (60 ml) water, ice cold", "Neutral oil, for brushing springform", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Filling</u>", "1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive or vegetable oil", "2 pounds (905 grams) mushrooms (see Note up top for suggestions)", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon (15 grams) unsalted butter", "2 shallots, minced (I used 4 small because I\u2019m a rebel)", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme, minced (use 1 teaspoon only if dried/jarred)", "3/4 cup (2 1/2 ounces or 70 grams) Comte, Emmantel or Gruyere, grated", "2 cups (475 ml) milk", "2 cup (475 ml) heavy cream", "6 large eggs, lightly beaten", "Freshly grated nutmeg (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Filling</u><br/>\n1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive or vegetable oil<br/>\n2 pounds (905 grams) mushrooms (see Note up top for suggestions)<br/>\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1 tablespoon (15 grams) unsalted butter<br/>\n2 shallots, minced (I used 4 small because I\u2019m a rebel)<br/>\n1 tablespoon fresh thyme, minced (use 1 teaspoon only if dried/jarred)<br/>\n3/4 cup (2 1/2 ounces or 70 grams) Comte, Emmantel or Gruyere, grated<br/>\n2 cups (475 ml) milk<br/>\n2 cup (475 ml) heavy cream<br/>\n6 large eggs, lightly beaten<br/>\nFreshly grated nutmeg (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Make buttery shell:</i> In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix 1 cup of the flour with all of the salt.
