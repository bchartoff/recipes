Cocoa qualities range. Salt preferences range. Flavor preferences range. This is an easily tweaked recipe. I ended up using a bit more sugar than I\u2019d expected, and more oil (as in, I\u2019d expected not to need as much as usually suggested due to the high fat content in peanuts but still used three tablespoons). I wanted more salt and wished I\u2019d found better peanuts to start with, but you know, a balmy high of 20 degrees this weekend doesn\u2019t exactly motivate one to hunt down the best ingredients. I can assure you that this is no less loved, despite it\u2019s average peanut base, and no more likely to only be eaten in the moderate spoonfuls promised.
