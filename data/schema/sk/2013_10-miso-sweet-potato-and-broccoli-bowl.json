I used a half-half mixture of Black Japonica and Brown Jasmine rice, which together made the prettiest purple-red mixture. I\u2019m one of those people who bought a rice cooker in the last year and now can talk about nothing else; being able to toss some water and grains in a machine and walk away while they cook themselves, and then keep themselves warm and perfect for an hour (easily) has changed dinnertime for the so-much-better, and you can use it for other grains too (I was going to use some rainbow quinoa in the mix as well, but decided not to overly complicate things.) A certain 4 year-old would like me to add that it plays Twinkle, Twinkle when you hit the start button, so there\u2019s that, too.</p><p>There\u2019s of course no reason to only use these vegetables, or to not swap in others, if you desire. I\u2019d estimate about 1/4 cup dried rice or grains per person; most triple in volume once cooked. I forgot to buy ginger before making the dressing this time and was shocked that we didn\u2019t notice it missing this time, so don\u2019t panic if you\u2019re short an ingredient or two.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>For the bowl</u>", "1 cup dried rice or another cooking grain of your choice", "1 to 2 sweet potatoes (about 1.5 pounds)", "1 large bundle broccoli (about 1 pound)", "1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil", "Coarse or kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon white sesame seeds", "1 teaspoon black sesame seeds", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>For the miso-sesame dressing</u>", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1 small garlic clove, minced", "2 tablespoons white miso (the mildest kind)", "2 tablespoons tahini (other nut butters can work in a pinch)", "1 tablespoon honey", "1/4 cup rice vinegar", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "2 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>For the miso-sesame dressing</u><br/>\n1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger<br/>\n1 small garlic clove, minced<br/>\n2 tablespoons white miso (the mildest kind)<br/>\n2 tablespoons tahini (other nut butters can work in a pinch)<br/>\n1 tablespoon honey<br/>\n1/4 cup rice vinegar<br/>\n2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil<br/>\n2 tablespoons olive oil</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 400 degrees.
