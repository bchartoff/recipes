However, my broiler doesn\u2019t work. Never has, so I cannot test this. But, if it\u2019s anything like my attempt (explained in the post) to use a blowtorch, I\u2019m not feeling overly confident about it because the unevenness of the toasts leads to edges singeing before the sugar fully melts. But if you try this method, please report back in the comments as to how it went. I\u2019m sure plenty of folks would prefer to avoid melting sugar.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/05-creme-brulee-french-toasts"}
