Mine are from McCormick, but they were also the only bottle I could find in the two different stores I went to. If you can\u2019t find them, use fresh or dried dill instead. You can put the dried dill in with the brine as you boil it. If fresh dill, I would drop it in the container your are storing the carrots in, just before you put them in the fridge.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/01-pickled-carrot-sticks"}
