I suppose from a distance they might seem similar \u2014 cornmeal, fat, leavener, baked into something of a quick bread \u2014 but true Southern cornbread would never have sugar in it and are decidedly less cakey. Given that I just learned that corn muffins the official state muffins of Massachusetts, I think we can safely presume that they\u2019re what happens when you let Yankees near Southern staples. (I\u2019m joking. Mostly.)</p><p>Most corn muffins are made with an equal or even greater amount of flour than cornmeal; these are 2/3 cornmeal, and seem like it wouldn\u2019t be terribly hard to replace that last 1/3 with a gluten-free flour mix if needed. CI had set out to make a savory corn muffin, using only 3 tablespoons sugar, but I liked these with 1/4 to 1/3 cup for the light sweetness I remember growing up, but at a level that\u2019s still anything but cloying. Finally, CI recommends Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Cornmeal, and says that you should not use coarse-ground or white cornmeal, but I used a mixture of fine yellow unfancy Indian Head cornmeal and medium-grind Bob\u2019s Red Mill (I used this portion for the pre-cooking step, to soften it) and had no complaints about the final texture.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups (280 grams) yellow cornmeal, to be divided", "1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea or table salt", "1 1/4 cups (300 ml) milk, whole is best here", "1 cup (240 grams) sour cream (full-fat plain yogurt should work here too)", "8 tablespoons (115 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly", "3 to 5 tablespoons (35 to 60 grams) sugar (see Note up top about sweetness)", "2 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2 cups (280 grams) yellow cornmeal, to be divided<br/>\n1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br/>\n1 teaspoon baking soda<br/>\n1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea or table salt<br/>\n1 1/4 cups (300 ml) milk, whole is best here<br/>\n1 cup (240 grams) sour cream (full-fat plain yogurt should work here too)<br/>\n8 tablespoons (115 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly<br/>\n3 to 5 tablespoons (35 to 60 grams) sugar (see Note up top about sweetness)<br/>\n2 large eggs</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Heat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).
