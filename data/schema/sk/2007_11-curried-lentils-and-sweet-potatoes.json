Second, I adore greens but this is \u2026 a lot of greens! I could barely fit mine in the pot. Using half would be just fine. Third, I am much more loose with measurements than the recipe suggests \u2014 I do measure the lentils but never the cilantro or scallions (a \u201chandful\u201d of each will suffice). Finally, I love all the garnishes but I don\u2019t think the dish needs each of them. I wouldn\u2019t dare skip the lime. But, you might not find that you need almonds and cilantro and scallions with so many other flavors going on. I am loathe to change this recipe in any significant way in 2020, however, as it\u2019s been a popular recipe here for so long so I\u2019m leaving my notes up top and will point to them throughout the recipe.", "totalTime": "About 1 hour", "recipeYield": "Yields 8 to 10 side-dish servings; 6 main-course servings", "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped small", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 1-inch piece fresh ginger root, peeled and grated", "1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala", "1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder", "1 jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded if desired, then minced", "4 to 5 cups vegetable broth as needed", "2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 4 cups)", "1 1/2 cups dried lentils (shown here are lentils de puy)", "1 bay leaf", "1 pound Swiss chard, center ribs removed, leaves thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "Finely grated zest of 1 lime", "Juice of 1/2 lime", "1/3 cup finely chopped roasted or tamari-flavored almonds, for garnish (optional), available in health food stores", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "\nIn large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.
