You can make crepes as needed. But even if you make two dozen crepes (don\u2019t worry, this recipe won\u2019t), they keep surprisingly well. You can stack them while they\u2019re still hot \u2014 they don\u2019t stick to each other \u2014 and take them out of the fridge the next day and warm them again. Savory or sweet, the filling possibilities are endless but you know, I mostly made these sweet. Not overly so, I hope.</p><p>These crepes would be equally good with any other stone fruit, from white peaches to nectarines to apricots. I sauteed the fruit in butter and honey (because nothing bad can happen there, can it?) but will fully confess that I found it unnecessary. Thinly sliced, insanely ripe stone fruit needs no cooking time, so consider the sauteeing optional, unless you\u2019re making this in the fall with apples or pears. In that case, I\u2019d double the fruit cooking time and possibly even the butter and honey to make a lovely filling.
