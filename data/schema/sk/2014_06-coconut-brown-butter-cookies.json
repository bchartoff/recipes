They also contain a spectacular amount of coconut. In fact, when you really look at it, there\u2019s amazingly little flour or eggs for the amount of butter and coconut, and these four things are what make this cookie different from any other. They\u2019re like a standard drop cookie (think: chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin) merged with a buttery, lacy florentine and they manage to have both the florentine\u2019s golden crisp and crackle and the drop cookie\u2019s faint chew. The browned butter, sea salt and vanilla extract are just the icing on the cake, but if you want to make them the original way, simply soften the butter, skip the water (necessary to make up for lost butter volume when it\u2019s browned), vanilla and reduce the salt to a pinch.</p><p>Note: I halved the original recipe, which called for a full pound of butter and 8 cups of coconut; I just couldn\u2019t.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "1 dozen (if you make the massive bakery size), about 2 dozen of a medium size (about 2T dough each; photos 6-8 here) or 4 dozen of a small size (1T each; top photo).", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup (2 sticks or 225 grams) unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons water", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (125 grams) granulated sugar", "3/4 cup (145 grams) packed light-brown sugar", "1 large egg", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons (175 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "Slightly heaped 1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt or 1/4 teaspoon table salt", "4 cups (240 grams) dried, unsweetened coconut chips (I used ", "<a href=\"http://www.bobsredmill.com/coconut-flakes.html\">these</a>", ")"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup (2 sticks or 225 grams) unsalted butter<br/>\n2 tablespoons water<br/>\n1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (125 grams) granulated sugar<br/>\n3/4 cup (145 grams) packed light-brown sugar<br/>\n1 large egg<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>\n1 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons (175 grams) all-purpose flour<br/>\n1 teaspoon baking soda<br/>\nSlightly heaped 1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt or 1/4 teaspoon table salt<br/>\n4 cups (240 grams) dried, unsweetened coconut chips (I used <a href=\"http://www.bobsredmill.com/coconut-flakes.html\">these</a>)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.

Once it is a deeply fragrant, almost nut-brown color, remove from heat and pour butter and all browned bits at the bottom into a measuring cup. Adding 2 tablespoons water should bring the butter amount back up to 1 cup. Chill browned butter in the fridge until it solidifies, about 1 to 2 hours.

If cookies have not spread as much as you see above, stir 2 teaspoons more water into cookie dough, mixing thoroughly, before baking off another tray. (See note below for full explanation.) This should do the trick, but if it does not, repeat the same with your next batch.

I find that for most standard American grocery store butters (I was using Trader Joe\u2019s store brand here, but the equivalent would be any non-European style butter), 1 tablespoon of water per stick (1/2 cup) of butter is a sufficient replacement. However, should you find that your first batch of cookies is too thick, a little extra water is all you\u2019ll need to get the texture right. It sounds scary, but I promise is as simple as can be. Holler at me in the comments if this doesn\u2019t work for you and please note the kind of butter and how much water you used. </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/06-coconut-brown-butter-cookies"}
