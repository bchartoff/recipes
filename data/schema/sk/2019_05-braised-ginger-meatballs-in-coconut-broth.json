If you can find it, one stalk of lemongrass, outer leaves removed and cut into 1-inch lengths, is a great addition here; add it with the ginger and garlic to the broth and remove it at the same time. I always add a bit of greens to this recipe. Baby spinach is the quickest. Since it\u2019s May, thinly sliced asparagus or trimmed asparagus in 1-inch segments would be wonderful. Add chiles to taste; two are called for. I often just put a few slices in (because: kids), and then marinate the rest in a little vinegar, setting them out to be spooned on top by those who want more heat.", "totalTime": "P0DT0H45M0S", "recipeYield": "6", "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds ground pork", "2 large eggs", "3 tablespoons panko breadcrumbs", "2 tablespoons finely chopped peeled fresh ginger", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "One 13 1/2-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk", "2 cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth", "1/4 cup thinly sliced peeled fresh ginger", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 fresh red chiles, thinly sliced, plus extra for serving  (see Note)", "Finely grated zest and juice of 1/2 lime", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Kosher salt", "A few handfuls of baby spinach", "Roughly chopped fresh mint and cilantro leaves", "Additional lime wedges", "Steamed jasmine rice (I estimate about 1/4 cup cooked per serving)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the meatballs: Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0.

Add spinach and cook just to wilt. Season the broth with more sugar, salt and lime juice if necessary.
