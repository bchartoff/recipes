When it comes to granola, what you\u2019re looking for is a basic proportion of chunky (nuts, dried fruit) to sticky (syrups, sugar, butter or oils) and from there, you can really go to town. The vanilla is optional. The cinnamon is optional. You can use no dried fruit or you can use all dried fruit in your 2 to 3 cup mix. You can toss in things like puffed rice cereal or flax seeds. In the comments, I\u2019d love to hear what mix you came up with and how you liked it. I can only imagine the possibilities.</p><p>Of note: The original recipe calls for something called \u201csticky bun sugar\u201d which can be made at home with sugar, butter and corn syrup. It is for this reason that corn syrup is listed within one ingredient but also separately, and I used all butter rather than two different fats. Whether the corn syrup can be entirely replaced with honey or maple syrup or the butter can be entirely replaced with a healthier oil is worth auditioning, I just didn\u2019t. Yet. I can tell you this: as is, this is the best granola bar I\u2019ve ever eaten.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 2/3 cups quick rolled oats (if gluten-free, be sure to use gluten-free oats)", "1/2 to 3/4 cup granulated sugar (use more for a sweetness akin to most purchased bars; use less for a mildly sweet bar)", "1/3 cup oat flour (or 1/3 cup oats, processed till finely ground in a food processor or blender)", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "2 to 3 cups dried fruits and nuts (total of 10 to 15 ounces)*", "1/3 cup peanut butter or another nut butter (I used almond butter) (optional)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, namely because I was not convinced that the flavor came through)", "6 tablespoons melted butter", "1/4 cup honey, maple syrup or corn syrup", "2 tablespoons light corn syrup (see Note above)", "1 tablespoon water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 2/3 cups quick rolled oats (if gluten-free, be sure to use gluten-free oats)<br/>\n1/2 to 3/4 cup granulated sugar (use more for a sweetness akin to most purchased bars; use less for a mildly sweet bar)<br/>\n1/3 cup oat flour (or 1/3 cup oats, processed till finely ground in a food processor or blender)<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon salt<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>\n2 to 3 cups dried fruits and nuts (total of 10 to 15 ounces)*<br/>\n1/3 cup peanut butter or another nut butter (I used almond butter) (optional)<br/>\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, namely because I was not convinced that the flavor came through)<br/>\n6 tablespoons melted butter<br/>\n1/4 cup honey, maple syrup or corn syrup<br/>\n2 tablespoons light corn syrup (see Note above)<br/>\n1 tablespoon water</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 350&amp;#176F.
