That\u2019s it. Repeat this to yourself as needed. You don\u2019t need a thermometer. Fleming doesn\u2019t give a temperature goal; she\u2019s trying to keep it simple. Look for an amber/light copper color and that\u2019s it, you\u2019re there. Don\u2019t look for what I did above; I overcooked it. I used it anyway; it\u2019s faintly bitter but nobody minds.Someone gave me a gift certificate to Williams-Sonoma for Hanukah a few years ago, which led to me buying a bunch of things that nobody really needs but bring me great joy, such as a rectangular tart pan, so I used it here. It holds 75% of the volume of the recipe below, written for a standard (9.5/10-inch round) tart pan. If you have one and want to use it, just use 75% of every ingredient below and you\u2019ll be set. Oh, and go ahead and use the whole egg yolk in the crust. It won\u2019t cause problems.Finally, this is not the recipe as Fleming wrote it; you can find her version in the book and throughout the web.
