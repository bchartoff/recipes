You can see many other iterations here. Most I\u2019ve seen either use raw hazelnuts, more water, sugar substitutes, cocoa or cocoa nibs. I opted instead for well-toasted hazelnuts for maximum flavor. I found that holding back the water slightly made it creamier, and with a good semi-sweet chocolate, it had a nice, mild sweetness (although children may not agree). You could add a teaspoon of sugar, simple syrup or your sweetener of choice to the mixture, or more to taste, if it\u2019s not sweet enough for you.</p><p>I imagine this would be wonderful in an iced coffee drink or milkshake, but we just like it straight from the fridge in a glass. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "About 3 3/4 cups chocolate hazelnut milk (or 3 2/3 cups toasted hazelnut milk, without the chocolate).
