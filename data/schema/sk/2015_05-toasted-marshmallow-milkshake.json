I\u2019m going to have to add \u201cburnt marshmallows\u201d to my official list of 3rd trimester cravings, I fear. This is essentially a vanilla ice cream shake, blended with the better part of a bag of charred marshamallows, plus two flavors I found enhanced the whole mess nicely: a scrape of vanilla bean seeds (though extract \u2014 ahem! \u2014 will work just fine) and a spoonful or two of sour cream, plain yogurt or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, the tang of which will help round out the sugar spun cloud of sweetness. I was highly tempted to make two variations on this shake, a s\u2019more shake (use chocolate ice cream, a swirl of chocolate fudge sauce and crumbled graham crackers on top) and a strawberry and toasted marshmallow shake (hull and slice 1/2 pound strawberries and macerate for 20 minutes with 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 tablespoon lemon juice; blend before adding milk and toasted marshmallows) but ended up being too obsessed with honing in on the vanilla marshmallow flavor to add any distractions. Do let us know if you try either variation \u2014 or one of your own invention! \u2014 in the comments.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Just shy of 3 shakes in the 12-ounce glasses shown; 4 to 5 shakes in the 8-ounce glasses we found to be a better portion size later", "recipeIngredient": ["1 (10-ounce, 283-gram) bag large marshmallows, divided", "1/2 cup milk", "Seeds scraped from 1/2 a small vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups vanilla ice cream", "2 tablespoons sour cream, plain yogurt or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1/4 cup heavy cream beaten to soft peaks with 1 teaspoon powdered sugar, for a whipped cream garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 (10-ounce, 283-gram) bag large marshmallows, divided<br/>\n1/2 cup milk<br/>\nSeeds scraped from 1/2 a small vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>\n2 cups vanilla ice cream<br/>\n2 tablespoons sour cream, plain yogurt or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche<br/>\n1/4 cup heavy cream beaten to soft peaks with 1 teaspoon powdered sugar, for a whipped cream garnish (optional)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Place your glasses in the freezer. Heat your broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil and coat it lightly with a nonstick spray. Set aside the number of marshmallows you\u2019ll want for garnishes (estimate 1 to 2 per shake) and spread the rest on the tray. Broil, keeping a close watch as the marshmallows will take on color very quickly, for 1 to 2 minutes, until they\u2019re the color you like. Don\u2019t be afraid of a little char; it really enhances the shake. Cool the tray in the freezer for 5 minutes, until marshmallows are no longer warm, then transfer broiled marshmallows to your blender. Blend with milk until as pureed as you can get them, then pause to individually toast marshmallows for garnish over a gas flame or back under your broiler for a moment. This ensures that they\u2019re warm when they hit the glass. Add vanilla bean or extract, ice cream and sour cream to the marshmallow mix in the blender, and blend until thick and smooth. Pour into chilled glasses, finish with a dollop of whipped cream, if using, and a warm marshmallow. Slurp through a straw; repeat again very soon.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/05-toasted-marshmallow-milkshake"}
