Worked fine, but the rise time is closer to an hour.<br/>\n** I slit them right before putting them in the oven, as we did in my bread class, in hopes to keep the mark as sharp as possible. However, they are not as easy to slit after boiling them, which forms a seal. I might try it both ways next time.<br/>\n*** For some reason, greasing and then cornmeal-ing a baking pan sounded like a potential stuck mess, so I instead lined one with parchment paper and sprinkled that with cornmeal. It worked great, and was a much easier clean up. (We\u2019d baked many breads in my bread class on parchment paper in my bread class, so I knew it should work.)</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2006/10-salt-cross-buns"}
