If you\u2019re not obsessed with these markings, you can scoop it right away. Scoop or spoon the dough into balls \u2014 Ovenly uses about a 1/4-cup scoop (probably #16); I use a 1 2/3 tablespoons or #40 scoop. Place on prepared pan. For the tallest final shape, place the tray in the freezer for 15 minutes before baking.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Sprinkle the dough balls lightly with coarse-grained sea salt just before baking.

Trust me, you should let these cool completely before eating so the different textures (crisp outside, soft inside) can set up.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Do ahead:</i> You can definitely make the dough in advance and either refrigerate it for a couple days or freeze it longer.

I tried it with and without and did find a better dome and final shape with the 15 minutes after. However, I was incredibly charmed by the striated marks from the cookie scoop on top of the cookie I bought last weekend, as well as in the photo in their book, and I realized that I couldn\u2019t get it at home with just-mixed dough; <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/22166581452/in/photostream\">you\u2019ll get more of a blob shape from your scoop</a>. So, I also chilled the dough for 15 minutes before scooping it and <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/22179208865/in/photostream\">was then satisfied with the shape</a>. It\u2019s not necessary unless you\u2019re as taken with top pattern as I am.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Two questions I suspect someone will ask very soon:</i> Can you make this with all-natural peanut butter and can you make this with almond or a nut butter? The answer to both is yes, however, the authors themselves warn that you\u2019ll get the best final shape and texture from a smooth, thick processed peanut butter like Skippy (their recommendation; updated to note, thanks to a commenter suggestion, that the 16.3-ounce jar of Skippy is estimated to contain 1 3/4 cups, saving you some measuring). I suspect an almond or cashew butter will have a similar effect as natural peanut butter. </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/10-salted-peanut-butter-cookies"}
