Scoop 6 3 1/2-ounce mounds of dough (the size of generous golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie.

Baking discs can be found from a number of brands, from Jacques Torres to <a href=\"http://www.guittard.com/home/index.html\">E. Guittard</a> (Fresh Direct used to sell these by the quarter pound, but now just in one pound boxes, but still at a very reasonable price) to <a href=\"http://shop.ghirardelli.com/product-exec/product_id/479/nm/72_Cacao_Gourmet_Baking_Chips\">Ghiradelli</a>. Can\u2019t find them? Use the largest chocolate chips you can find. Ghiradelli sells some slighly larger ones in the <a href=\"http://shop.ghirardelli.com/product-exec/product_id/338/nm/60_Cacao_Bittersweet_Baking_Chips\">brown bag</a> (as opposed to the standard-sized chips in the <a href=\"http://shop.ghirardelli.com/product-exec/product_id/341/nm/Semi_Sweet_Baking_Chips\">gold bag</a>) though I may have mixed the two varieties up.
