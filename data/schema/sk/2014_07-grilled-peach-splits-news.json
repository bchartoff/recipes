You can skip the sugar in the whipped cream if you\u2019d like more of a tangy grown-up contrast between that and the ice cream and peaches. You could probably skip the whipped cream altogether, but where is the fun in that? Even the peaches, once grilled, can be rewarmed in an oven. If you don\u2019t have a grill, you can roast the peaches at 375\u00b0F for 30 to 35 minutes, face-down in a well-buttered dish, or less, if you\u2019d like them semi-firm.

Set over medium heat. In a few minutes, the sugar will begin to melt. Use a spoon or spatula to stir it as it melts, to ensure it does so evenly, breaking up any chunks as needed. Continue to stir continuously until the melted sugar takes on an amber color, which usually happens at about the same time the last sugar chunk melts. Remove from heat and <i>carefully</i> stir in cream, just a little drizzle at first (it will hiss and splatter) and then the rest. If your sugar re-solidifies, return the saucepan to the stove over medium-low and stir it until the sugar melts again. Let caramel sauce cool slightly before adding bourbon or vanilla and salt. Store caramel sauce in a glass container for up to 1 week in the fridge. Rewarm to loosen the caramel into a sauce consistency, as needed. If using it within a couple hours, you can leave it out.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make whipped cream:</u> Using a clean bowl and whisk (electric or a regular large one), whip cream and sugar, if using, until it holds soft peaks.
