For reasons a food scientist (or just a scientist) will better explain, I find that frozen desserts (popsicles, this, etc.) get a better texture when you start with a simple syrup, however, I cannot be bothered to heat and cool simple syrup, not when I can simply add sugar to water and let it sit for 15 minutes to dissolve and not require cooling. (Thank you, Alice Medrich for this tip.) That said, this is not a \u201ctrue\u201d simple syrup (which are 1:1 sugar and water); here we use a little more water to help thin the berries enough to make them freeze with an icy texture. The sweetness level here is on the tart side, but you could make it even more tart by using 6 tablespoons sugar instead. You might try your mixture and adjust the sweetness to the sweetness of your berries, which will vary, but keep in mind that desserts taste less sweet once frozen.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup water", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "3 cups fresh raspberries", "1 tablespoon lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup water<br/>\n1/2 cup granulated sugar<br/>\n3 cups fresh raspberries<br/>\n1 tablespoon lemon juice</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Stir water and sugar together in a glass or bowl and let sit 15 minutes.

Pour into a large baking dish; keeping the thickness of the puddle shallow means your dessert will be finished more quickly. After about an hour \u2014 freezing time will vary by freezer temperature and puddle depth \u2014 the mixture should be half-frozen. Stir with a fork, scraping the surface and out to the corners to break up the ice, forming coarse glittery crystals. Return to the freezer and repeat this process every 30 minutes for another hour or two, until the mixture is fully frozen in flakes. To serve, scoop into glasses.</p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/08-raspberry-crushed-ice"}
