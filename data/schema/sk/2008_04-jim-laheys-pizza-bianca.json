Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of an electric mixer, and slowly add 1 cup cold water. Mix on low speed until ingredients begin to combine, increase speed to medium-high, and continue to mix for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and cleanly pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2. Place dough in an oiled bowl, and allow to rest for 2 to 4 hours until it has doubled in size. Split the dough into halves, and form each into a log.

Put dough on a lightly floured baker\u2019s peel. Dimple dough by pressing it down with your fingertips. Work the dough outward toward the edges of the peel until you reach your desired size and thickness, about 1/4 inch.  [Or in our case, realize that I forgot to do this, and instead rolled it out!] Drizzle with remaining olive oil, rosemary and sprinkle with remaining salt.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>4. Place a baking stone, sometimes known as a pizza stone, in the oven. Set oven to broil, about 520 degrees. Slide pizza onto baking stone with the baker\u2019s peel. Bake until the bubbles range from golden to deep brown in color, 10 to 12 minutes. [Great trick if you don\u2019t have a peel: Use the back of a baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal.]</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><b>Update:</b> I\u2019ve added so many clarifications in the comments, I want to point you to them from here, such as why you <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/04/jim-laheys-pizza-bianca/#comment-108863\">don\u2019t have to have a pizza stone</a>, <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/04/jim-laheys-pizza-bianca/#comment-108872\">why a KitchenAid is not a requirement</a> and <a href=\"https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/04/jim-laheys-pizza-bianca/#comment-108875\">why the broil setting, when you\u2019re not broiling</a>.
