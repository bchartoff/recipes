I\u2019ve made Yankee cornbread (sweet, cake-like), Southern cornbread (nominal sugar, with a cast-iron skillet crunchy edges) and even my own bastardized version (goat cheese, caramelized onions) but this one is different. There\u2019s no butter or lard in it. There\u2019s very little buttermilk but a lot of sour cream. There\u2019s a bit of sugar, but only enough to balance the salt and heat. It\u2019s as good toasted with honey and butter as it is with spicier fare, like chili, and it makes a really fun addition to your weekend scrambled eggs. So is this it? I\u2019m not positive, but I liked it enough that I plan to make it six or seven more times, just to think real hard about it.
