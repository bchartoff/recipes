As you can imagine, you could likely use 3 cups of many chopped fruits or berries for different, delicious bundts throughout the year, such as cranberries in the fall or even diced peaches and other stone fruits in the month or two to come. Have fun with it. </p><p>Although I made these with the 3 cups of berries listed below (using one cup each of blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries, though currants or huckleberries or whatever you can get would also be delicious) I think this cake has the potential to be even more of a \u201cberry bomb\u201d with a fourth cup of berries. The cake as written below is full of berries, but it\u2019s a balanced amount \u2014 they don\u2019t overwhelm the cake, and I do really like a cake that\u2019s almost overwhelmed with fruit.</p><p>Updated with weights, at last, 7/10/12. Plus, a note about weights: Making it even more confusing for home cooks, not every recipe writer agrees on the weight of a cup of flour or sugar. However, when there\u2019s a discrepancy between what I would get and what a recipe writer has included in their ingredients, I default to their measurements, as I do below. The weights are on the heavy side by my measurements (my spoon-and-sweep  cups clock in at 125 grams), but will work as listed in this recipe.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Cake</u>", "2 1/2 cups (355 grams) plus 2 tablespoons (20 grams) all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons (10 grams) baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt", "1 cup (8 ounces or 225 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 3/4 cups (340 grams) granulated sugar", "Zest of 1 lemon", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 cup (175 ml) buttermilk", "3 cups (350 to 450 grams) mixed berries", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Glaze</u>", "2 cups (240 grams) powdered or confections\u2019 sugar", "Juice of 1 lemon", "1 tablespoon (15 grams) unsalted butter, very, very soft"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Glaze</u><br/>\n2 cups (240 grams) powdered or confections\u2019 sugar<br/>\nJuice of 1 lemon<br/>\n1 tablespoon (15 grams) unsalted butter, very, very soft</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F.

In the bowl of a stand mixer or large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, sugar and lemon zest until light and impossibly fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Then, with the mixer on a low speed, add your eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl between each addition. Beat in vanilla, briefly. Add 1/3 flour mixture to batter, beating until just combined, followed by half the buttermilk, another 1/3 of the flour mixture, the remaining buttermilk and remaining flour mixture. Scrape down from time to time and don\u2019t mix any more than you need to. In the bowl where you\u2019d mixed your dry ingredients, toss the berries with the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour. With a silicon spatula, gently fold the berries into the cake batter. The batter will be very thick and this will seem impossible without squishing the berries a little, but just do your best and remember that squished berries do indeed make for a pretty batter.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Spread cake batter \u2014 you might find it easier to plop it in the pan in large spoonfuls, because it\u2019s so thick \u2014 in the prepared baking pan and spread the top smooth. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, rotating the cake 180 degrees after 30 (to make sure it browns evenly). The cake is done as soon as a tester comes out clean of batter. At 10 minutes before my baking time was up, a tester was totally wet with batter and I was <i>certain</i> it would never be done in the estimated time. 7 minutes later, the same tester was clean as a whistle, so fret not.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Set cake pan on a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes, before inverting the cake onto a serving platter to cool the rest of the way.

However, if you have a regular Bundt, not nonstick coated, you\u2019re really going to want to make sure every nook and cranny is well-coated with butter or even shortening (the solidity of both helps them stick to the cake walls), and then dust the inside with flour. Setting your cake pan in the fridge or freezer (to set the coating even further) while you make the cake batter will provide even more insurance. I hope this improves the release rate of the cake! </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/06-triple-berry-summer-buttermilk-bundt"}
