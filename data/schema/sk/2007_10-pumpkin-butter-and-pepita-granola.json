The first is that I think most recipes have too much oil, and that gets in the way of clumping. I am updating the recipe to include less of it. The second is that it burns very quickly, so just because I can get away with 30 minutes baking time in my oven doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t over-toast in 20 in yours. I\u2019d suggest you check it every five minutes after the 15 minute mark. Finally, and this is the hardest-learned advice I can give: keep it in the freezer. Granola, even in an airtight container, actually <i>especially</i> in an airtight container, gets soft after a couple days. In the freezer, it stays crisp and crunchy indefinitely, and also extends the shelf life to months. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats<br/>\n1 cup sweetened flaked coconut<br/>\n1/4 cup vegetable oil<br/>\n1/3 cup sliced almonds (1 oz)<br/>\n1/2 cup chopped walnuts<br/>\n1/3 cup green (hulled) pumpkin seeds, sometimes called pepitas (1 1/2 oz; not roasted)<br/>\n1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar<br/>\n1/4 cup mild honey<br/>\nPinch cinnamon<br/>\nPinch salt (flaky sea salt is wonderful in here)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 cup tart dried cherries<br/>\n1/2 cup dried blueberries<br/>\n1/2 cup dried pears (1/4 inch dice)<br/>\n1/2 cup diced dried apricots (1/4 inch dice)<br/>\n1/3 cup golden raisins<br/>\n\u2014 or \u2014<br/>\n2 3/4 cups mixed dried fruit of your choice (I used pears, figs and tart cherries)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Accompaniment: Sliced bananas; plain yogurt flavored with vanilla extract, pumpkin or apple butter</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.
