More of a cookie dough, it\u2019s used with sweet dessert tarts, and it\u2019s easiest to make in a food processor, if you have one. This was my first time using this recipe (and not Martha Stewart\u2019s version) and I thought the addition of ground almonds was delicious. Though I halved it, I still have quite a bit remaining, which I think I\u2019ll roll out, sprinkle it with coarse sugar and cut it into small cookies.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes enough for three 9-inch tart crusts.", "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2sticks (10 ounces; 290 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 1/2cups (150 grams) confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "Lightly packed 1/2 cup (2 1/4ounces; 70 grams) ground blanched almonds", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "3 1/2 cups (490 grams) all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2 1/2sticks (10 ounces; 290 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br/>\n1 1/2cups (150 grams) confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted<br/>\nLightly packed 1/2 cup (2 1/4ounces; 70 grams) ground blanched almonds<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon salt<br/>\n1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>\n2 large eggs, at room temperature<br/>\n3 1/2 cups (490 grams) all-purpose flour</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1.\tTo make the dough: Place the butter in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade and process, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until creamy. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar and process to blend well. Add the ground almonds, salt, and vanilla and continue to process until smooth, scraping the bowl as necessary. Lightly stir the eggs together with a fork and, with the machine running, add them to the work bowl; process for a few seconds to blend. Finally, add the flour and pulse until the mixture just starts to come together. When the dough forms moist curds and clubs and then starts to form a ball, stop! \u2014 you don\u2019t want to overwork it. The dough will be very soft, and that\u2019s just as it should be. (If you want to make the dough in a mixer, use the paddle attachment. First beat the butter until it is smooth, then add the remaining ingredients in the order given above. Just be careful when you add the flour \u2014 you must stop mixing as soon as the flour is incorporated.)</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>2.\tGather the dough into a ball and divide it into 3 pieces.

The easiest way to work with pate sucree is to roll it out between sheets of plastic wrap. Just flatten a large piece of plastic wrap against the counter and roll the dough between that and another piece of plastic. Turn the dough over often so that you can roll it out on both sides, and as you\u2019re rolling, make sure to lift the sheets of plastic several times so that they don\u2019t crease and get rolled into the dough. (If the dough becomes too soft, just slip it, still between plastic, onto a baking sheet and pop it into the fridge for a few minutes.) Remove one sheet of the plastic and center the dough (exposed side down) over the tart pan. Press the dough against the bottom of the pan and up the sides, removed the top sheet of plastic wrap and roll your rolling pin across the rim of the pan to cut off the excess. If the dough cracks of splits while you\u2019re working, don\u2019t worry \u2014 you can patch the cracks with leftover dough (moisten the edges to \u201cglue\u201d them into place). Just be careful not to stretch the dough in the pan (what you stretch now will shrink later). Chill for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
