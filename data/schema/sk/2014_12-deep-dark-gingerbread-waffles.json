Just a dusting of powdered sugar and maybe, if you\u2019re feeling fancy, a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche will make these even more perfect.

Curse Deb, because these waffles are very sticky and eager to tear. Trust Deb, that they will be worth it. Spread them on a tray in a single layer to let cool slightly; within 1 minute, they should be crisp to the touch and easier to lift. Repeat with remaining batter.
