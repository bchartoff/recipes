In the original version, I suggest up to a 50% flour (here I\u2019d suggest 1 cup) swap of barley flour, if you\u2019ve got it. It\u2019s not like other wholegrain flours, but much more silky and delicate. It has a subtle creamy, nuttiness goes well here.", "totalTime": "P0DT1H0M0S", "recipeYield": "12 to 16", "recipeIngredient": ["9 tablespoons (125 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1 1/2 cups (300 grams) plus 3 tablespoons (40 grams) granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "1 large egg yolk", "1 1/2 teaspoons (8 ml) vanilla extract", "3/4 cup (175 ml) milk, whole is preferred but all varieties have worked", "2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "2 1/4 cups (295 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 pounds (680 grams) of the freshest, even a touch overripe, strawberries, hulled and halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).

In a large bowl, beat butter, salt, and 1 1/2 cups of the granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg, yolk, and vanilla and beat until combined. Add milk and mix until (updated) combined; it may look a little curdled but don\u2019t fret, it will smooth out in a minute.

Arrange strawberries cut side down, as snugly as you can get them to fit. If you have extra, nudge them in anyway. Leave no strawberries behind.
