Well, not these, a different recipe and they\u2019re good, great even, but I\u2019ve always wanted to fix it up a little. That brownie recipe is wonderful, but not simplified enough for a two-step process and there was never enough cheesecakiness (oh yes, it is a word) to balance it. Also, my mother has always made hers with chocolate chips swirled into the cream cheese and although I feel that a good brownie should not need extra chocolate in the form of frosting or chips to make it work, it sure cuts fantastically through the cream cheese swirl. Thus, three changes and a new recipe was warranted. Make these instead.</p><p>I added the aforementioned chocolate chips and more unsweetened chocolate to the brownie recipe, as commenters seemed to feel it was not chocolaty enough. I don\u2019t think anyone could make the same argument about these.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Makes 16 2-inch square, thick brownies", "recipeIngredient": ["RECIPE_SUBHED__1<u>Brownie batter</u>", "1 stick (1/2 cup or 4 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped", "1 cup sugar", "2 large eggs", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "2/3 cup all-purpose flour", "RECIPE_SUBHED__2<u>Cheesecake batter </u>", "8 ounces cream cheese, well softened", "1/3 cup sugar", "1 large egg yolk", "1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "RECIPE_SUBHED__3<u>Plus</u>", "1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Plus</u><br/>\n1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><u>Make brownie batter:</u> Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.
