I found the viscous consistency off-putting, and I like heat moderate, at best. Plus, the recipes I\u2019d seen before this one too daunting, with ingredients that, sure, I could easily purchase in New York City, but would be unlikely to use particularly often after that. Not this recipe. The most \u201cout there\u201d ingredient is dried wood-ear mushrooms, which I intentionally dodged to sort out whether it would be just as good with fresh ones (it is). I added bamboo shoots because we like them in there, but the recipe doesn\u2019t require it. There\u2019s no cornstarch; only eggs thicken the liquid. Heat comes from sriracha; sour comes from rice vinegar. There\u2019s pork in it, but I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t make it vegetarian with a vegetable broth and extra tofu and mushrooms. Should you use pork, it calls for 1/2 pound of pork shoulder, which not all butchers will sell you. You could shave off a 1/2 pound and freeze the rest for another meal, or you could do as Joanne Chang does in her recipe, which inspired this, and use 1/2 pound ground pork instead. Pork shoulder will be much easier to cut into neat little strips if frozen or half-frozen first, although I didn\u2019t bother. </p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce (1/2 cup) dried wood ear mushrooms or 5 fresh button or shiitake mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons canola oil or other neutral cooking oil", "1/2 pound lean pork shoulder, sliced 1/8 inch thick and cut into 1-by-1/4-inch strips, or 1/2 pound ground pork", "1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic", "1 tablespoon finely chopped peeled fresh ginger", "1/2 cup chopped scallions, plus more for garnish, if desired", "4 cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth", "1/3 cup (about 2 ounces) bamboo shoots, drained", "1/2 pound soft tofu, cut into 1/2-inch dice", "1/3 cup unseasoned rice vinegar, plus more for serving", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 teaspoon sugar (I skipped this)", "1 teaspoon black or white pepper", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "1 tablespoon Sriracha, plus more for serving", "Kosher salt", "2 large eggs, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 ounce (1/2 cup) dried wood ear mushrooms or 5 fresh button or shiitake mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced<br/>\n2 tablespoons canola oil or other neutral cooking oil<br/>\n1/2 pound lean pork shoulder, sliced 1/8 inch thick and cut into 1-by-1/4-inch strips, or 1/2 pound ground pork<br/>\n1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic<br/>\n1 tablespoon finely chopped peeled fresh ginger<br/>\n1/2 cup chopped scallions, plus more for garnish, if desired<br/>\n4 cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth<br/>\n1/3 cup (about 2 ounces) bamboo shoots, drained<br/>\n1/2 pound soft tofu, cut into 1/2-inch dice<br/>\n1/3 cup unseasoned rice vinegar, plus more for serving<br/>\n3 tablespoons soy sauce<br/>\n1 teaspoon sugar (I skipped this)<br/>\n1 teaspoon black or white pepper<br/>\n1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil<br/>\n1 tablespoon Sriracha, plus more for serving<br/>\nKosher salt<br/>\n2 large eggs, beaten</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>If using dried mushrooms: Cover the mushrooms with boiling water in a small bowl, and let stand until softened, about 30 minutes.
