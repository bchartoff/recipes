Remove with a spider or large slotted spoon, let oil drip off a little, back into the skillet, then spread onions out on paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining onions.

Drain beans, then plunge them into ice water to full stop them from cooking. Drain again, and set aside. (If you are adamant about only using one pot, you can boil them in your 12-inch cast iron skillet that you use for the other steps.

Add the mushrooms, salt and pepper and saute them until they start releasing their liquid, anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes, depending on how they were chopped. Add the garlic and saute one minute more. Add the flour and stir it until it fully coats the mushrooms. Add the broth, 1/4 cup at a time, stirring the whole time. Simmer mixture for 1 minute, then add cream and bring back to a simmer, cooking until the sauce thickens a bit, about 5 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently. </p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><i>Assemble and bake:</i> Add cooked greens beans to sauce and stir until they are coated.

Green beans can be cooked and kept in fridge until needed, at least one day. Green beans can also be combined with mushroom sauce and kept refrigerated for up to a day. Add onions and bake shortly before serving. Finally, it\u2019s less ideal, but the entire dish can be cooked, loosely wrapped (so the crispy top doesn\u2019t get soggy) and then rewarmed in a low oven before serving. Just keep an eye on the topping so it doesn\u2019t get too brown while reheating.</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p><strong>A few notes:</strong> </p>"}], "link": "https://smittenkitchen.com/2013/11-green-bean-casserole-with-crispy-onions"}
