The original recipe called for separating eggs, whipping the whites separately and folding them into the custard batter. Alas, the custard batter was far too wet and thin to do anything but allow chunks of white to float to the top, like foam, leaving a sticky and distinctly not meringue-like layer on top of my pudding. My synopsis? Pass on splitting eggs.</p><p>Finally, as far as bread puddings go, this is not one that is overly eggy or custardy. For some, this is a plus. But if you like your bread puddings truly submerged and then suspended in their custard, rather than just lightly soaked in it, increase the eggs to 4 and the milk to 4 cups. The spices and sugar can remain the same.</p>", "totalTime": "", "recipeYield": "", "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound bakery white or challah bread, crusts removed, cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 Granny Smith apple, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 cup (6 ounces) golden raisins, plumped in hot water for 15 minutes", "3 large eggs", "3/4 cup sugar", "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/8 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "3 cups whole milk", "2 tablespoons unsulfured molasses", "1/4 cup sliced almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>1 pound bakery white or challah bread, crusts removed, cut into 1-inch cubes<br/>\n1 Granny Smith apple, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br/>\n1 cup (6 ounces) golden raisins, plumped in hot water for 15 minutes<br/>\n3 large eggs<br/>\n3/4 cup sugar<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon<br/>\n1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br/>\n1/8 teaspoon ground ginger<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>\n1/4 teaspoon salt<br/>\n3 cups whole milk<br/>\n2 tablespoons unsulfured molasses<br/>\n1/4 cup sliced almonds</p>"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<p>Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.
