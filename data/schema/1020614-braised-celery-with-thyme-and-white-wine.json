{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Celery With Thyme and White Wine", "description": "Inspired by the French method of cooking duck or chicken confit, in which the meat stews slowly in its own fat, this recipe simmers celery in a classically French sauce, with white wine, stock, shallots and herbes de Provence. The celery is first blanched in heavily salted water, which jumpstarts the cooking process and seasons the stalks from the inside-out, then it\u2019s roasted in liquid until submissive and silky, with a texture reminiscent of roasted fennel. Once the celery is tender, the liquid is reduced on the stovetop until just thick enough to coat a spoon. The resulting sauce bears an uncanny similarity to the jus underneath the Thanksgiving turkey, in both flavor and mouthfeel, and the dish is equally at home at the Thanksgiving table as paired with a store-bought rotisserie chicken and some mashed potatoes. Like classic confit, you can prepare it in advance and simply reheat before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/dining/19celeryrex2/merlin_164213256_9221ef1a-b75a-439f-982f-011c61e041b0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "butter, celery, herbes de provence, thyme, white wine, fall, winter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "2 heads fresh celery (about 2 pounds)", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock", "3/4 cup dry white wine", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 medium shallots, peeled and thinly sliced into rounds", "12 fresh bay leaves", "8 fresh thyme sprigs", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns", "1 tablespoon dried herbes de Provence", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 stick), diced", "Small sprigs of fresh parsley or finely chopped parsley leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over high, and heat the oven to 400 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the celery: Separate the stalks, and reserve some celery leaves for garnish.
