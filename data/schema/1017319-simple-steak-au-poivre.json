Essentially it is a saut\u00e9ed steak, with a quick pan sauce. This version made with black peppercorns and Sichuan pepper tastes bright but not overpoweringly peppery or boozy. If you serve it with scallion-mashed potatoes, your home cooked steak au poivre will put the best neighborhood bistro to shame.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/01/dining/01KITCHEN1/01KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, steaks and chops", "keywords": "beef tenderloin steak, cognac, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, Sichuan pepper, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 533}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 558, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "759 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 beef tenderloin steaks, 6 ounces each, cut 1 inch thick", "Salt", "1 tablespoon coarsely crushed black pepper", "1 teaspoon coarsely crushed Sichuan pepper", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 large shallots, finely diced", "1 1/2 cups rich beef or chicken broth", "1 tablespoon Cognac or bourbon", "1/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 bunch watercress, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put steaks in a shallow dish and season well on both sides with salt.
