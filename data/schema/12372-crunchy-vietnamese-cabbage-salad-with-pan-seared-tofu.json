{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy Vietnamese Cabbage Salad With Pan-Seared Tofu", "description": "Cabbages are the quintessential storage vegetable. You can cut a cabbage in quarters or thirds and use one piece at a time. The other hunks will keep, wrapped well in the vegetable crisper, for at least two weeks, and potentially a lot longer if you mist them with water every once in a while. That means you can buy one large cabbage and use it several times for different recipes, experiencing the deceptively versatile vegetable many ways. Fried tofu turns this Vietnamese-inspired slaw into more of a meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/28/dining/cabbagesalad-still/cabbagesalad-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "cabbage, extra firm tofu, peanut, dairy-free, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 185}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 285, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1094 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons Asian fish sauce", "Zest and juice of 1 lime", "1/2 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and minced", "1 garlic clove, minced", "4 tablespoons peanut oil", "1/2 pound extra-firm tofu, cut into slabs, 3/4 inch thick", "6 cups shredded cabbage", "1 large carrot, grated", "1/3 cup coarsely chopped roasted, salted peanuts, plus more to serve", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, plus more to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make vinaigrette, whisk together 2 tablespoons soy sauce, brown sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce, lime zest and juice, jalape\u00f1o and garlic.
