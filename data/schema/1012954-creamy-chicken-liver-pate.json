Here, you just soften onions in butter, cook the livers, cool, pur\u00e9e and refrigerate.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to bother with soaking the livers in milk, a step found in many recipes. Season aggressively: you want to taste the pepper, the coriander, the brandy and even the allspice and clove.\n\nFinally, cook the liver quickly, over pretty high heat. What you want is to brown the outside while keeping the inside pink. This, perhaps, is another major difference between p\u00e2t\u00e9 and chopped liver, in which the livers are almost always cooked to death.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/01/dining/creamy-chicken-liver-pate/creamy-chicken-liver-pate-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken liver, cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 149}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "187 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 to 15 peppercorns", "2 allspice berries", "1 clove", "4 coriander seeds", "1/2 cup butter", "1 onion, chopped", "1 pound chicken livers", "Salt", "1/3 cup cream", "1 to 2 tablespoons brandy", "Bread or crackers for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a spice grinder or clean coffee grinder, combine peppercorns, allspice, clove and coriander seeds; grind until fine and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; when foam subsides, add onion and cook until softened, about 3 to 4 minutes.
