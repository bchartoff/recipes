{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rao\u2019s Chicken Scarpariello (Shoemaker\u2019s Chicken)", "description": "Chicken scarpariello, also known as shoemaker's chicken, is a classic Italian-American dish of chicken, sausage, vinegar, onions and peppers that has all the flavors and textures: Tangy and rich, spicy and sweet, tender and crunchy. Our version is adapted from one found on the menu at Rao's, the reservations-impossible Southern Italian restaurant and celebrity hangout in Harlem. It starts with pan-frying chicken pieces and Italian sausage in a little olive oil until golden brown. Bell peppers, jalape\u00f1os, onion and garlic go into the pan and are saut\u00e9ed until soft. All of that \u2013 plus hot peppers, potatoes, vinegar and wine \u2013 goes into a roasting pan and into a hot oven until the sauce thickens and the chicken is cooked through. (The potatoes are totally optional, by the way, but they are a nice, pillowy counterpoint to the prickly heat of the peppers.) Serve with a hunk of good bread to mop up the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jason Epstein"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/27/dining/27COOKING-RAOSCHICKEN2/27COOKING-RAOSCHICKEN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, sausage, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 513}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 890, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "67 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "1297 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and breasts, breasts cut crosswise in half", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\u00a0to taste", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "4\u00a0links\u00a0Italian sausage\u00a0(2 hot and 2 sweet), about 1 pound", "2\u00a0large\u00a0bell peppers\u00a0(red, yellow or green), seeded and cut into thin strips", "2\u00a0jalape\u00f1o peppers, halved lengthwise, seeded and cut into thin slices", "1\u00a0large\u00a0sweet onion, cut in half lengthwise and sliced", "1\u00a0teaspoon minced\u00a0garlic", "4 to 8\u00a0hot vinegared\u00a0cherry peppers (or peppadew or pepperoncini), left whole", "2 to 3\u00a0small\u00a0red potatoes, peeled, sliced and boiled until tender, but not mushy (optional)", "1/2\u00a0cup\u00a0chicken broth", "1/2\u00a0cup\u00a0dry white wine", "1/4 to 1/2 cup\u00a0red wine vinegar, to taste", "1\u00a0tablespoon dried\u00a0oregano leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
