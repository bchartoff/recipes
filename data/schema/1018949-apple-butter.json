{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Butter", "description": "A great answer to that eternal question \u2014 \u201cWhat do I do with all these apples?\u201d \u2014 apple butter is a sweetened, concentrated, lightly spiced spread that\u2019s smoother than jam and thicker than applesauce and fantastic on buttered toast, thinned with vinegar as a sauce for pork chops, or used to top breakfast treats like pancakes, waffles or biscuits. The apples here are intentionally left unpeeled and uncored to take advantage of the extra flavor in the peels and pectin-rich cores. (A pass through a food mill or sieve after cooking will pull them out.) As for the ideal apple butter apple \u2014 well, there is none. Use nearly any variety: This recipe is only improved by mixing and matching. Note, too, that this can be made on the stovetop or in the oven. The oven method may take longer, but it can be worthwhile if only to avoid the inevitable splattering of the stovetop method.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/28/dining/28COOKING-APPLEBUTTER/28COOKING-APPLEBUTTER-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "About 4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "apple, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 214}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 311, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "19 milligrams", "sugarContent": "72 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds apples (about 10 to 12 medium), washed, unpeeled, uncored, cut into 1-inch chunks", "1/2 cup apple cider vinegar", "3 allspice berries (optional)", "2 cinnamon sticks (optional)", "1 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and sliced (optional)", "1 star anise pod (optional)", "1 1/4 cups granulated sugar", "1 cup light brown sugar", "Small pinch kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine apples, vinegar, allspice berries (if using), cinnamon sticks (if using), ginger (if using), star anise pod (if using) and 4 cups water in a large, heavy bottomed pot over high heat.
