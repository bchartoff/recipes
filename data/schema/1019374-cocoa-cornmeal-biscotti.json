{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cocoa-Cornmeal Biscotti", "description": "Everything about these biscotti tends toward crunch \u2013 their signature double bake, of course, but also the addition of almonds and some cornmeal, which doesn\u2019t lose its appealing roughness under heat. (Don\u2019t think, as I mistakenly once did, that using a polenta-type cornmeal will improve these cookies \u2014 it will only make them gritty; choose a fine-grain meal.) The chocolate chips are there to reinforce the deep chocolate flavor the cookies get from being made with cocoa. I like these very crunchy, but if you prefer them less set, give them a shorter second bake. And after the first bake, when the logs have cooled for about 20 minutes, use a long serrated knife and a gentle sawing motion to slice them into cookies about 1/2-inch thick. Hold on to the inevitable crumbs and any little bits that might break off \u2014 you\u2019ll be happy to have them over ice cream.<strong></strong>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/24/magazine/24Dessert/24Dessert-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 46", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "cocoa powder, cornmeal, mini chocolate chips, sliced almonds, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 75, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "43 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1\u00a01/2\u00a0cups (204 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2\u00a0cup (42 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder", "1/2\u00a0teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2\u00a0teaspoon baking powder", "1/2\u00a0teaspoon baking soda", "1/4\u00a0cup (42 grams) finely ground cornmeal", "1 stick (113 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 cup (200 grams) sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/2\u00a0cup (87 grams) mini semisweet chocolate chips", "1/2\u00a0cup (50 grams) sliced almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to 350.
