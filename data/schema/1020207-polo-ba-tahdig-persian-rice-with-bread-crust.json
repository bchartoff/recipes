{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Polo Ba Tahdig (Persian Rice With Bread Crust)", "description": "No dinner in an Iranian household is complete without polo, or rice. And no pot of polo is complete without tahdig, the crisp crust whose name means \u201cbottom of the pot.\u201d Tahdig is a highlight of Persian cuisine, and it can be made of rice, potatoes, lettuce or bread, as it is here. If you can\u2019t get your hands on lavash bread, use a thin flour tortilla to line the bottom of the pot. Tahdig is easiest to prepare in a nonstick pot, but you could also prepare it in a cast-iron Dutch oven by reducing the heat to low and extending the cooking time to 50 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/14Iranianrex4/merlin_154114503_4ca82386-afb4-4727-9b4a-7bb5eae0a744-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "basmati rice, lavash, saffron, tortilla, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 172}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups basmati rice", "Fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads", "1 large piece lavash bread or 8-inch flour tortilla", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the rice in a large bowl and cover with water.
