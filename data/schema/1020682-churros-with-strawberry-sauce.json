Serve them coated in cinnamon sugar and, instead of injecting them with jam, dip them into strawberry sauce \u2014 or raspberry sauce, Mexican chocolate with cinnamon, even guava sauce. For fluted edges on your churros, you\u2019ll need a pastry bag fitted with a large French star pastry tip, but you could also use a resealable plastic bag with a tip cut off. To prepare the churros in advance, try this trick: Pipe the dough into 6-inch lengths on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then freeze. Fry directly from the freezer in oil heated to 375 degrees (mixture will bubble up).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/11/dining/10churros1/merlin_165064092_907e7bc2-223d-4ff9-bee0-4ea02c72edd0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen churros", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, pastries, project", "keywords": "anise liqueur, brown sugar, cinnamon, strawberries, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pints fresh or frozen strawberries (about 24 ounces)", "3 tablespoons brown sugar, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Canola oil, for frying", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "1 1/2 cups anise liqueur, such as Pernod", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 cups all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the sauce: Wash, dry and hull the strawberries, then transfer them to a food processor.
