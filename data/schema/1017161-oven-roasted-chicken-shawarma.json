It is perfect for an evening with family and friends. Serve with pita and tahini, chopped cucumbers and tomatoes, some olives, chopped parsley, some feta, fried eggplant, hummus swirled with harissa, rice or rice pilaf. You can make the white sauce that traditionally accompanies it by cutting plain yogurt with mayonnaise and lemon juice, and flecking it with garlic. For a red to offset it, simmer ketchup with red pepper flakes and a hit of red-wine vinegar until it goes syrupy and thick, or just use your favorite hot sauce instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/06/dining/06COOKING-ROASTCHICKSHAWARM2/06COOKING-ROASTCHICKSHAWARM2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "turkish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "chicken thighs, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 7413}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 390, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "462 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 lemons, juiced", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil", "6 cloves garlic, peeled, smashed and minced", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "2 teaspoons paprika", "1/2 teaspoon turmeric", "A pinch ground cinnamon", "Red pepper flakes, to taste", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1 large red onion, peeled and quartered", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a marinade for the chicken.
