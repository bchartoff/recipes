{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb Oat Shortcakes", "description": "Roasting rhubarb with Demarara sugar until the stalks caramelize and soften enough to collapse gives you a heady and intense jamlike compote with a molasses edge. Here, it\u2019s paired with tender, biscuitlike shortcakes made with a little oat flour for complexity and plenty of whipped cream. It\u2019s important to let the rhubarb juices truly caramelize at the edges of the pan; they should turn deep mahogany brown before you pull it from the oven. Then mix those syrupy juices with the rest of the rhubarb for the deepest flavor. You can make the biscuits and rhubarb up to eight hours in advance. Store them at room temperature until ready to serve.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/multimedia/clark-rhubarb-shortcakes/clark-rhubarb-shortcakes-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 shortcakes", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, heavy cream, oats, rhubarb, vanilla bean, dessert, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 156}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 805, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "100 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "43 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "sodiumContent": "520 milligrams", "sugarContent": "51 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/180 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon/95 grams old-fashioned oats", "1/3 cup/80 grams light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon/15 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange or lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "8 tablespoons/115 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick), cubed", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters heavy cream, more for brushing shortcakes", "Demerara sugar, for garnish", "2 pounds/907 grams rhubarb, trimmed and diced into 1-inch pieces (7 cups)", "1 cup/210 grams Demerara sugar", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1 vanilla bean, split and scraped", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters heavy cream", "1/2 cup/120 grams cr\u00e8me\u00a0fra\u00eeche", "1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar or honey (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
