It was published in 1995. Practical and pragmatic in the technical aspects of soup making, Ms. Sheraton is an unabashed hedonist when it comes to serving and consuming it. \"Chicken soup must be very, very hot,\" she counsels. \"You want to have to inhale it, to take tiny sips at first and build, as the soup cools, to larger and larger bites. Near the end, you are racing to finish. Tepid soup is dead.\"        \n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 - 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "one pot, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 60}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 5- to 6-pound chicken, with neck and all giblets except liver", "12 cups water, plus more as needed", "2 medium carrots, peeled and quartered", "3 stalks celery with leaves, cut in half", "1 medium yellow onion, with peel, cut in half", "3 sprigs Italian parsley", "10 black peppercorns", "2 small leeks, green and white parts, split and washed well, optional", "2 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried, optional", "1 small bay leaf, optional", "5 whole cloves, optional", "2 to 3 teaspoons kosher salt", "Chopped fresh parsley or dill, for garnish, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the chicken in a 6- to 7-quart soup pot and add the water (it should cover chicken).
