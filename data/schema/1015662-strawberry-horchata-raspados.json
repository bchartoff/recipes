It came to The Times from the pastry chef Fany Gerson, who grew up in Mexico City, after the newspaper put out a call for shaved-ice recipes. Ms. Gerson advises the use of Mexican cinnamon in the drink, suggests adding a second can of condensed milk to the syrup if you desire a stickier, sweeter outcome, and makes the excellent point that there is no need to seek out an expensive ice crusher to make a raspado. You can use a blender to crush ice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT8H20M", "recipeYield": "About 6", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 13}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 738, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "91 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "241 milligrams", "sugarContent": "63 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups almonds, blanched", "3/4 cup medium-grain rice", "1 3-inch piece Mexican cinnamon (canela)", "3 cups hot water", "1 can condensed milk", "1 can evaporated milk", "Pinch salt", "1 pint strawberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
