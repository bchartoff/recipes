{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Venison and Trotter Pie", "description": "This lavish, British-style meat pie is a delicious, time-consuming project. It comes together over many hours, layering the flavors and textures of many different meats, and seals it all in a buttery homemade dough. The recipe belongs to the chef Angie Mar of the Beatrice Inn in New York, who makes the pie at her restaurant in smaller ramekins, so that each person gets her own marrow bone. This family-style version serves several people, but a single bone works beautifully: As the pie bakes in the oven, most of the marrow melts out, bubbling into the sauce, making it even richer. The pie filling, made from potatoes and venison braised in trotter stock, is thickened with a little flour, but it should be slightly loose when you're putting the pie together. The crust requires suet, and though you could make it all-butter if you wanted to, it seems that if you've come this far, and located the marrow bone, the trotters and the venison meat, you may as well go all the way. The finished pie is certainly worth it.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/10/dining/10marrrex/10marrrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H", "recipeYield": "1 9-inch deep dish pie, 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, pies and tarts, project", "keywords": "beef suet, marrow bone, pig trotter, venison shoulder, white wine, fall, winter, high protein, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 102}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 cups/1.2 liters chicken stock", "1 pig trotter, split lengthways", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds/700 grams venison shoulder or leg meat, cut into about 2-inch pieces", "Kosher salt", "4 tablespoons/40 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/188 milliliters white wine", "1/2 onion", "6 cloves garlic, peeled and halved", "6 sprigs thyme", "1 bay leaf", "1 cup fingerling potatoes or new potatoes, boiled until tender", "1 5- to 6-inch marrow bone, outside scraped clean", "2 1/2 cups/300 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons/30 grams sugar", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "5 1/2 tablespoons/75 grams cold unsalted butter, coarsely grated", "5 1/2 tablespoons/75 grams cold beef suet, coarsely grated (or use additional butter)", "3/4 cup/200 milliliters ice water", "1 egg, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the filling: In a heavy-bottomed pot that fits the trotter pieces in a single layer, bring the stock and trotter to a boil.

When flour is slightly brown, add the wine, scraping all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

Put a 9- or 10-inch deep-dish pie plate on a foil-lined baking tray and stand the marrow bone up in the center of the pan. Spoon all the meat, potato filling and gravy around it. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12-inch round and cut a small cross at the center. Drape dough over the pie plate, pushing the marrow bone right through the center, so it\u2019s sticking out. Use scissors to cut excess dough away, leaving at least an inch hanging off the edge all around. Use a fork to press down and crimp the dough where it\u2019s touching the edge of the pan, leaving the overhang attached. (It will make a kind of curtain around the the dish.) Generously brush the dough all over with the beaten egg, and bake until the crust is deep golden brown, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes, then season the open top of the marrow bone with a little salt and serve."}]}
