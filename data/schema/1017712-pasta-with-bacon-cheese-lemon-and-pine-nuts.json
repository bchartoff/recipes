This one starts out small -- pasta with butter and cheese -- but can be expanded with pine nuts, lemon zest, brown butter, bacon and herbs into something satisfying.\n\nThis kind of \"modular\" meal, which everyone at the table can add to or subtract from, is a great family dinner solution. You prepare one tasty base element, like warm tortillas or pasta or salad greens. After that, it\u2019s about piling on -- or politely passing on -- all the garnishes at the table.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/20/dining/lemon-pasta/lemon-pasta-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "bacon, parmesan, pasta, pine nuts, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 781}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 937, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "111 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "597 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces thickly sliced bacon, cut across into pieces about 3/4-inch wide", "1 to 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan, in a small serving bowl", "About 1/3 cup chopped parsley, scallions or mint, in a small serving bowl", "Hot red pepper flakes, in a small serving bowl", "1 large lemon", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds pasta", "4 to 8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 to 1 stick)", "1/3 cup pine nuts", "Coarse salt, such as Maldon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a large pot of salted water on to boil.\u00a0Put the cheese, herbs and red pepper flakes on the table.
