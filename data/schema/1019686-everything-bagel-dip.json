A little tangy from sour cream, this spread can be used as a dip for pretzels, potato chips, raw vegetables and, yes, bagel chips. But it's just as good on a sandwich \u2014 or even a bagel, if you're crazy for everything spice. One thing to note: If you're making it by hand, make sure to keep your cream cheese quite soft. It'll make things a lot easier.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/dining/as-everything-bagel-dip/as-everything-bagel-dip-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, cream cheese, seeds, sour cream, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 301}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons dried minced onion", "2 tablespoons poppy seeds", "2 tablespoons white sesame seeds", "1 teaspoon fennel or caraway seeds", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon flaky salt", "8 ounces cream cheese, cut into small pieces, at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups sour cream", "Crudit\u00e9s, bagel chips, potato chips and-or pretzels, for serving", "Make ahead: Dip can be made 5 days before serving."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, mix together the dried onion, seeds, garlic powder and flaky salt.
