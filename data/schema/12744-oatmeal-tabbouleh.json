{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oatmeal Tabbouleh", "description": "This is a good tabbouleh alternative for those of you who can\u2019t tolerate wheat, though you must seek out a brand of steel-cut oats that has been processed in a gluten-free facility if you need to avoid gluten. Unlike traditional tabbouleh, which is a really a parsley salad with a little bit of fine bulgur, this is more of a lemony grain salad with a generous amount of parsley and other herbs. For best results, toss the soaked oats with the dressing and refrigerate overnight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/12/science/12recipehealth/12recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, oats, parsley, tomato, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 32}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 182, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "456 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup quick-cooking steel-cut oats", "Salt to taste", "1 cup boiling water", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1 cup chopped fresh parsley", "2 to 4 tablespoons chopped fresh mint (to taste)", "2 tablespoons chopped chives", "2 to 3 medium tomatoes, finely chopped (omit if not in season)", "1 cucumber, 2 Persian cucumbers, or 1/2 European cucumber, seeded if necessary and cut in small dice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the steel-cut oats and salt to taste in a bowl and pour on 1 cup of boiling water.
