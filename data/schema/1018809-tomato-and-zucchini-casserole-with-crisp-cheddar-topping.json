{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tomato and Zucchini Casserole With Crisp Cheddar Topping", "description": "This casserole is a modern twist on an old favorite, the tomato-zucchini bake. But instead of a Parmesan and bread-crumb topping, this one is covered in a savory oat and Cheddar crumble that crisps and browns in the oven. Dollops of garlicky, herbed ricotta make the casserole wonderfully rich and creamy, while olives liven it up with their salty tang. This is equally good warm or at room temperature, preferably served within four hours of baking so the topping stays crunchy. Or you could make it the night before and reheat it in a 375-degree oven until bubbling. It makes an excellent side dish or meatless main course.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/28/dining/28POTLUCK1/28POTLUCK1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "cheddar, oats, olives, ricotta, tomato, zucchini, main course, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 341}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 300, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "444 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed, more for buttering casserole dish", "1 1/2 cups whole milk ricotta", "1/2 cup fresh basil or mint leaves", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "2 1/2 pounds tomatoes, cut into 1 1/2-inch wedges", "1 pound slim zucchini, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt, more as needed", "1/2 cup high-quality pitted black olives, roughly chopped", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup rolled oats", "1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh chopped oregano or marjoram", "3/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "Pinch cayenne pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and butter a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish or 2-quart gratin dish."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor or blender, pur\u00e9e the ricotta, basil and garlic."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss tomatoes, zucchini and 1 teaspoon salt in casserole to combine, then spread into an even layer.
