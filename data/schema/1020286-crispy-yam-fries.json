{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Yam Fries", "description": "Not to be confused with American sweet potatoes, West African yams are large, starchy root vegetables found at most West African, Caribbean or Latin American markets. Check the yams for freshness by pressing down on their skin before purchasing; the root should be firm with no soft spots. The brown skin peels off easily with a sharp knife or vegetable peeler to reveal a stark white flesh. These yams are larger, much starchier, denser and less fibrous than American yams or sweet potatoes. Crispy yam fries are a well-known Nigerian snack and side dish. They can be shallow-fried in oil or baked in the oven for a slightly healthier variation (see Tip).
