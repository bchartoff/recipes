All it takes is some semolina, a little water, a strainer and a steamer. Once you have practiced it a few times to pick up the knack, it is easy, even magical. Not to mention a showstopping addition to the table.\n\n\u201cMaking couscous is not hard,\u201d said Mr. Arazi, 32. \u201cBut it is labor intensive. For Leetal and me, couscous is craftsmanship. We are losing the battle of making it to industrial processed couscous.\u201d\n\nHe learned to make couscous from his mother, who was born in Mogador, now Essaouira, a town in Morocco once known for its expert couscous makers. \u201cI, the only son in my family, love to preach about it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sisters never made couscous in their life.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/28/dining/28JPCOUSCOUS4/28JPCOUSCOUS4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fall, semolina flour, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 29}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 414, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "393 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["500 grams Bob\u2019s Red Mill or other semolina flour (2 3/4 cups)", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste", "1/3 cup canola, soybean or vegetable oil", "2 cups water, beef or chicken broth"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the semolina in a large mixing bowl. Place 1/2 cup water in a sprayer and use it to moisten the semolina. Begin by spraying the surface, stirring the mixture with your hand, pressing down and moving the palm in a circular motion. It is better to have too little moisture than too much because you don\u2019t want to create a dough. Continue to spray and mix until water is evenly incorporated into the semolina; it should form tiny granules without clumping, and not all the water may be needed."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "At this point, depending on the texture of the mixture, you may want to sift it for uniformity and to remove any small clumps. To sift it, shake the moistened semolina through a strainer or colander with holes about 1/8 inch in diameter (better slightly larger than smaller) and into another bowl. After most of it has passed through, stir to continue to pass it through, then press to pass as much as possible. There may be a small amount of doughy mixture that won\u2019t go through the strainer \u2014 as much as 1/3 cup \u2014 and this may be discarded."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a couscoussiere or steamer by adding four to five inches of water to the bottom, and bring it to a boil.
