{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman's Romesco Sauce", "description": "Romesco is a rich Spanish sauce of charred tomatoes and roasted red peppers, pur\u00e9ed and thickened with toasted almonds and bread. The flavors are further sharpened with the addition of raw garlic, vinegar, chile powder or red pepper flakes (adjust the heat to your liking). The result is a smoky, pungent sauce, one usually served with mild-mannered vegetables and fish. (Some Spaniards say that a grilled vegetable feast is just an excuse for eating romesco.) But the sauce is just as good on a piece of toast that\u2019s been brushed with olive oil and rubbed with yet more garlic. If you have the time, let the sauce stand for an hour at room temperature before serving, allowing the flavors to meld all the more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/26/dining/recipes-romescosauce/recipes-romescosauce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, healthy, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 175}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 416, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "485 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large red pepper, about 1/2 pound, roasted, peeled, seeds and membranes removed", "3 medium tomatoes or 4 Roma tomatoes (about 3/4 pound)", "2 thick slices (about 2 ounces) baguette or country-style bread, lightly toasted", "2 large garlic cloves, peeled", "1/2 cup toasted almonds, or a combination of almonds and skinned roasted hazelnuts", "1 to 2 teaspoons pure ground chile powder or red pepper flakes, to taste (pepper flakes are hotter)", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika or Spanish smoked paprika (pimenton)", "Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1/4 to 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the broiler and cover a baking sheet with foil.
