{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Pork Shoulder With Chile Paste", "description": "A well-seasoned, chile-paste-slathered pork shoulder is already going to win, no matter what you do to it. Which seems to me like the ideal reason to try a new technique: slow roasting, off-flame, with ambient heat, using your outdoor grill as a coal-fired oven in the off-season of dead winter. Even if your live coals snuff out, or smoke too heavily, or you get bored of the snow-muffled silence or feel lonely in the winter solitude of your backyard, even if you miscalculate sunset and find yourself in the dark with a cellphone flashlight trying to read the internal temperature of the meat to discover it\u2019s still raw in the center \u2014 all you have to do is close up shop out back, come inside and shove the thing in your conventional oven and then read the newspaper until dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/27/magazine/27mag-eat-slide-IDC6-copy/27mag-eat-slide-IDC6-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT7H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, barbecues", "keywords": "chiles d\u2019\u00e1rbol, cilantro, guajillo chile, pasilla chile, pork shoulder, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 135}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 753, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "55 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "860 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 boneless pork shoulder with nice fat cap intact, about 9 pounds", "3 tablespoons coarse kosher salt", "2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper", "6 pasilla chiles, stemmed and seeded", "6 guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded", "8 chiles d\u2019\u00e1rbol, stemmed and seeded", "12 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 bunch scallions, washed, roots trimmed, cut in thirds", "1 bunch cilantro with stems, washed well", "6 tablespoons white vinegar", "2 pinches kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set pork shoulder in a deep roasting pan just large enough to accommodate it.
