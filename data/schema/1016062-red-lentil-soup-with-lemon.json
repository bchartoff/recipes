{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red Lentil Soup With Lemon", "description": "This is a lentil soup that defies expectations of what lentil soup can be. It is light, spicy and a bold red color (no murky brown here): a revelatory dish that takes less than an hour to make. The cooking is painless. Saut\u00e9 onion and garlic in oil, then stir in tomato paste, cumin and chile powder and cook a few minutes more to intensify flavor. Add broth, water, red lentils (which cook faster than their green or black counterparts) and diced carrot, and simmer for 30 minutes. Pur\u00e9e half the mixture and return it to the pot for a soup that strikes the balance between chunky and pleasingly smooth. A hit of lemon juice adds an up note that offsets the deep cumin and chile flavors.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/dining/mc-red-lentil-soup/merlin_146234352_d7bc8486-b067-4cff-a4c0-7741f166fb60-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, red lentils, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 10513}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 204, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "210 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil, more for drizzling", "1 large onion, chopped", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Pinch of ground chile powder or cayenne, more to taste", "1 quart chicken or vegetable broth", "2 cups water", "1 cup red lentils", "1 large carrot, peeled and diced", "Juice of 1/2 lemon, more to taste", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over high heat until hot and shimmering.
