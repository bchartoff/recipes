It is the sort of meal you could put together on a weekend afternoon and serve for nights to come. It is the best sort of family food.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/dining/roy-choi-stew/merlin_167226090_3ff938cd-6b16-47b1-880e-fec6453c9765-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, korean", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "main course, short ribs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 781}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds bone-in short ribs", "1 small bunch scallions, trimmed and roughly chopped", "1 1/2 cups soy sauce", "1/4 cup chopped fresh ginger", "1 small yellow onion, roughly chopped", "1/2 cup garlic cloves, peeled (about 2 heads)", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 cup mirin", "1/2 cup fresh orange juice", "1/2 cup apple juice", "1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, stems reserved for another use, halved or quartered if large", "1 cup jarred, peeled chestnuts", "1 cup taro, peeled and cut into large dice (about a 3-inch segment)", "1 cup carrots, peeled and cut into large dice (about 2 carrots)", "1 cup butternut squash, peeled and cubed (about half a squash)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put short ribs in a bowl, and cover with water.
