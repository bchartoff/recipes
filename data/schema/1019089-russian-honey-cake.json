{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Russian Honey Cake", "description": "The key to making this exquisite, gravity-defying cake, which comes from Michelle Polzine of 20th Century Cafe in San Francisco, is patience. This cake takes a lot of time!  Set some aside to do it right. There are just two components \u2014 airy, lightly spiced cake layers and glossy whipped-cream frosting, both tinged with burned honey \u2014 but both require precision. Clear your schedule, and your countertop, to make the time and space to get it right. Then  invite a dozen or two of your favorite people over the next day to delight in the impressive results of your hard work. You can buy dulce de leche at most Mexican markets or upscale groceries (look for brands made in Argentina), or make it a day ahead using this recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/17/magazine/17mag-eat1/17mag-17eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 9-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cream, dulce de leche, wildflower honey, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 389}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups (18 ounces) wildflower honey, divided", "1/4 cup (2 ounces) water", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (8 ounces) sugar", "14 tablespoons (7 ounces) butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "6 large eggs", "2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda", "2 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt or 1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea salt, divided", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "3 3/4 cups (16 ounces) all-purpose flour", "1 1/4 cups (1 13.4-ounce can) dulce de leche", "4 3/4 cups heavy cream, chilled and divided"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 375.
