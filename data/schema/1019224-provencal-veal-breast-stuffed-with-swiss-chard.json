{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Proven\u00e7al Veal Breast Stuffed With Swiss Chard", "description": "This Passover holiday recipe, an ancient jewel of Jewish Proven\u00e7al cooking, feels modern with our new love of Swiss chard. It is traditional to use a whole veal breast with all the bones, but that makes for a giant roast by today\u2019s standards. For this simplified but magnificent version, have a butcher trim, butterfly and remove the bones -- and save them to cook beside the meat, where they will add flavor and texture to the braise. The dish tastes best cooked a day ahead to allow the flavors to blend.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/21/dining/21passoverrex1/21passoverrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french, jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "kosher, main course, matzo, red wine, swiss chard, veal", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 543, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1001 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons olive oil", "3 large onions; 2 diced, 1 cut into 2-inch pieces", "Kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon) plus 2 cloves, unpeeled", "4 sprigs thyme, leaves removed and chopped (about 1 teaspoon)", "1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves removed and finely chopped (1 teaspoon chopped)", "2 pounds Swiss chard (2 to 3 bunches), leaves and stems chopped", "1 (15-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "1 square matzo, crumbled into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 boneless breast of veal, about 4 pounds, trimmed, butterflied, bones reserved (a butcher can do this, or order it for you); see note", "1/2 cup C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne or other dry red wine", "3 carrots, cut in half lengthwise and then cut on the diagonal in 1-inch slices"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the filling: In a large skillet, heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat.
