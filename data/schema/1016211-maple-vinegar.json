{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple Vinegar", "description": "Vinegar can be made out of wine, beer, cider or, in this case, dark rum. This is a simpler formula than most (from \"Ideas in Food,\" by Aki Kamozawa and H. Alexander Talbot) with no yeasty \"mother\" or molds to deal with. A dose of sugar (such as maple syrup, which lends a haunting sweetness here) helps the process along: it is converted into alcohol, which then ferments into the softer acetic acid. The result is like balsamic vinegar but rounder and more syrupy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, condiments, project, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 412, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "18 milligrams", "sugarContent": "71 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/3 cups live vinegar (look for the words \"unfiltered\" or \"organic\" on a label)", "3 cups maple syrup", "1 1/3 cups dark rum", "7/8 cup water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour the vinegar into a large glass or plastic container with a loose-fitting lid.
