{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Hash Browns", "description": "A riff on Josh Ozersky\u2019s famous minimalist hash browns, these are made by sprinkling grated sweet potato over hot butter in a very thin layer, then waiting patiently for the starch to work its magic. Crisp, salty, buttery and addictive, these hash browns are so good, you could probably eat the entire batch in one sitting (or force yourself to be generous and share with a friend). Serve with a fried or over-easy egg for a complete breakfast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jampel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/21/dining/sj-sweet-pot-hash-browns/sj-sweet-pot-hash-browns-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, winter, side dish, sweet potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 398}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "414 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large sweet potato (10 to 12 ounces), scrubbed and dried", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using the large holes of a box grater, grate the sweet potato onto a paper towel.
