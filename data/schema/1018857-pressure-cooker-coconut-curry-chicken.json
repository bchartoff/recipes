And it\u2019s a great and adaptable medium for cooking other proteins \u2014 not just chicken. Try cubes of lamb, fish fillets, or chunks of pork. Or, if you prefer boneless chicken breasts to thighs, use them here, pressure-cooking them for 2 minutes instead of 4.\n\nWhen serving, tell your guests to be aware of the cardamom pods so they don\u2019t accidentally bite into one\u2014or use the ground cardamom instead. And note that brands of garam masala vary in terms of their chile content, so some are hotter than others. If you\u2019re unsure how hot your mix is, add it gradually to the pot, tasting as you go.\n\n<i>This is one of <a href=\"/68861692/7716592-melissa-clark-dinner-in-an-instant\">ten recipes</a> from Melissa Clark\u2019s \u2018Dinner in an Instant: 75 Modern Recipes for Your Pressure Cooker, Multicooker, and Instant Pot\u2019 (Clarkson Potter, 2017).</i>\n\n<i>Melissa Clark\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562277/dinner-in-an-instant-by-melissa-clark/9781524762964/\">\u2018Dinner in an Instant\u2019</a> is available everywhere books are sold. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Instant-Recipes-Pressure-Multicooker-ebook/dp/B06XK41BQV/?tag=NYTBks-20&ascsubtag=dinnerinstant\">Order your copy today.</a></i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/25/dining/coconutcurrychicken/coconutcurrychicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, cookbook exclusive, curries", "keywords": "cardamom, chicken thighs, ghee, ginger, tomatoes, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1161}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 644, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "59 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "1235 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 4 ripe tomatoes, halved through their equators", "3 tablespoons ghee, unsalted butter or safflower oil", "3 tablespoons virgin coconut oil", "2 cups finely chopped onions", "6 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced", "2 tablespoons grated peeled fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 3-inch cinnamon stick or 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "8 cardamom pods, lightly crushed with the flat side of a knife, or 1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks", "1 to 2 teaspoons garam masala, to taste", "1/2 cup canned unsweetened coconut milk", "Cooked basmati rice, for serving (optional)", "Plain yogurt, for serving (optional)", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a box grater over a bowl.
