In Iran, it is typically served at weddings or other celebrations. Great platters of it appear at banquets. It also goes beautifully with a weeknight roast chicken.\n\nYou will probably need to do a little shopping to make this traditional dish. But it is well worth it, and most good supermarkets can supply what you require.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/12/dining/persian-jeweled-rice/persian-jeweled-rice-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "basmati rice, dried fruit, pistachio, fall, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 655}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 491, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "72 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "310 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups best-quality Basmati rice", "Kosher salt", "Unsalted butter, 6 tablespoons in total", "1 large onion, diced small", "1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, crumbled and soaked in 1/4 cup hot water", "Large pinch ground cinnamon", "Large pinch ground cardamom", "Large pinch ground allspice", "Large pinch ground black pepper", "Large pinch ground cumin", "1/3 cup chopped dried apricots", "1/3 cup golden raisins or currants", "1/3 cup dried imported barberries or goji berries, soaked in warm water for 5 minutes and drained (or use 1/3 cup dried cherries or dried cranberries)", "1/3 cup blanched slivered almonds", "1/3 cup roughly chopped pistachios."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the rice several times in cold water until the water runs clear.
