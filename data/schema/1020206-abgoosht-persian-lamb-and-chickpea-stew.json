Once the stew is cooked, it is divided into two parts: The meat, potatoes and beans are pulled from the stock and mashed into a meat paste, goosht kubideh. Simple to prepare, the dish turns into an occasion for a gathering, as the broth and meat paste are served with piles of warm flatbread, pickles and fresh herbs, palate cleansers that offset the richness of the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/14Iranianrex3/merlin_154258188_a8e988d7-5bce-43ff-a5a8-01d6318a52b6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, meat, soups and stews", "keywords": "lamb shanks, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 31}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds bone-in lamb shank", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup dried chickpeas", "1/2 cup dried white beans, such as navy or cannellini", "2 large yellow onions, quartered", "1/4 cup tomato paste", "3 large russet potatoes (about 2 pounds)", "6 Omani (dried Persian) limes, rinsed and punctured multiple times with a fork", "Persian liteh pickles, for serving", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020212\">Salad-e Shirazi</a>, for serving", "Warmed sangak bread or other freshly baked flatbreads, for serving", "Assorted fresh herbs (such as mint, tarragon and basil), scallions and radishes, for serving (optional)", "Doogh (Persian yogurt drink), for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The night before you plan to cook, season the lamb with turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
