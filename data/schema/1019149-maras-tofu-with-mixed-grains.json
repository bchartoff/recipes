{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mara\u2019s Tofu With Mixed Grains", "description": "With only a few steps and five main ingredients, this simple dish barely requires a recipe, but the results are simultaneously nourishing and deeply satisfying. Steeped in aminos (soy sauce's unfermented cousin), the semisoft tofu melts away with each bite, leaving behind a steamy, satisfying contrail of salt and umami. The coconut oil lends a trace of its sweet, tropical aroma as it yields a crisp, lacy crust. Mixed with quinoa, the rice becomes nutty and complex, a chewy counterpoint to the tender tofu. Plus, it's healthful enough to justify a little self-righteousness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/14/magazine/14mag-eat/14mag-14eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, vegetables", "keywords": "bragg's liquid aminos, jasmine rice, quinoa, tofu, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 401}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups Thai jasmine rice", "2/3 cup quinoa", "3 cups water", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 14-ounce blocks medium-firm tofu", "6 tablespoons Bragg\u2019s liquid aminos", "4 to 6 tablespoons coconut oil", "Cilantro leaves for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse and drain rice and quinoa.
