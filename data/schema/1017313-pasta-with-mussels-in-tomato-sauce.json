But you can make the dish with whole-wheat or gluten-free pasta; both are getting better and better. Look for a flat noodle like tagliatelle, fettuccine or linguine.\n\nIf you use whole-wheat or gluten-free pasta, make sure not to overcook it. My rule of thumb is to check for doneness a minute before the suggested cooking time on the package; noodles should be cooked al dente.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/25/dining/25MARTHA/25MARTHA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas", "keywords": "linguine, mussels, tomatoes, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 312}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 626, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1095 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 can chopped or whole tomatoes (14.5 ounces)", "3 fat garlic cloves; 1 crushed, 2 minced", "1 shallot, chopped", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "2 pounds mussels, rinsed, scrubbed and beards removed", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or marjoram, or both", "Pinch sugar", "Salt to taste", "3/4 pound linguine or other pasta", "1/4 cup chopped flat leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pulse tomatoes with juices in food processor just a few times to break down into a coarse pur\u00e9e; set aside.
