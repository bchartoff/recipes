{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Toad-in-the-Hole", "description": "Among the breakfast options at SingleThread is an English menu, with toad-in-the-hole as its centerpiece. Mr. Connaughton calls it an homage to Heston Blumenthal \u2014 the innovative English chef and owner of The Fat Duck \u2014 for whom he worked for several years. For the eggs, Mr. Connaughton uses sous-vide techniques: vacuum-sealing the eggs, processing them in a water bath and using a siphon canister. Lacking such equipment in your kitchen, you can still approximate the result by gently and softly scrambling the egg mixture. And if you prefer, even a well-trimmed poached egg can be centered on the toast and cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/10Connaughton-rex-3/merlin_144869958_b6d8ac50-0e3d-4de0-8d5b-8940e2477c66-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "bread, cheddar, egg, half and half, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 440, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "502 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 thick slices (about 3/4-inch) milk or Pullman bread, or brioche", "6 ounces white farmhouse Cheddar, preferably English, grated", "4 large eggs", "2 large egg yolks", "3 tablespoons half-and-half", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a nonstick or a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, toast bread until crisp and well-browned.
