(If you grill this rub directly, the sugar and spices will burn rather than melt into appetizing darkness.)\n\nThe recipe is forgiving. You might add granulated onion or garlic powder to it, or omit the coriander if you don\u2019t have any. Be careful with the paprika, as there are so many different varieties afoot: if it\u2019s smoked, you\u2019ll need less, and if it\u2019s fiery you may need less cayenne. No cayenne? Use red pepper flakes. Adjust the seasonings to your taste, then apply liberally.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20LONDONBROILRUB/20LONDONBROILRUB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "2 3/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cayenne pepper, chili powder, coriander, cumin, paprika, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 219}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 141, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "251 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup paprika, or 1/3 cup smoked paprika", "1/4 cup kosher salt", "1/4 cup freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup brown sugar", "1/4 cup chile powder", "3 tablespoons ground cumin", "2 tablespoons ground coriander", "1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well with a fork to break up the sugar and combine the spices.
