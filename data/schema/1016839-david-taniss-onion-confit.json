{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "David Tanis's Onion Confit", "description": "The French word \u201cconfit\u201d usually refers to food that is slowly cooked in some kind of fat. Originally, confit was a method used for preserving meat, typically duck, goose or pork. When stored and cooled in earthenware crocks, a layer of fat on top kept the food from spoiling by sealing out air. Onion confit, on the other hand, is a savory preparation of sliced onions, cooked to a soft, almost melting consistency, often seasoned with salt, herbs, sugar and vinegar for a somewhat sweet-and-sour effect. Sometimes called onion marmalade, a spoonful or two makes a perfect accompaniment to roasted meats. It may also be used to make onion tarts or pizzas, or as a \u201cbed\u201d for baked fish. The mixture will last for a week or so, refrigerated. To use, reheat gently over low heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/24/dining/24KNIFEREX/24KNIFEREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "appetizer, onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 44}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 218, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "623 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds medium onions", "6 tablespoons butter, duck fat or lard", "2 teaspoons sugar", "Salt and pepper", "2 bay leaves", "A few fresh thyme sprigs", "Pinch of cayenne", "2 tablespoons white wine vinegar or red wine vinegar", "1/2 cup dry white or red wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut onions in half from top to bottom (not crosswise).
