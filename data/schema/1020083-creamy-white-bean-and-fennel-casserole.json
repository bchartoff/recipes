{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy White Bean and Fennel Casserole", "description": "This one-pan recipe melds roasted fennel, creamy white beans and salty Parmesan, and tops it with crunchy lemon-zested panko. Fennel is often dismissed because of its perceived licorice notes, but the anise flavor is significantly muted after the vegetable is cooked. Tuck fresh, sliced sausages into the mixture before baking to imitate a simplified cassoulet, turn it into a side dish by pairing it with meat or let the dish live as a main, served with a simple green salad and some rustic bread to sop up the sauce. Reserve the fresh fennel fronds for garnish, which add concentrated fennel flavor and a pop of green.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Aaron Hutcherson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/06/dining/ah-fennel-casserole/merlin_151073283_9551fdf3-732d-47ba-9d8a-5b8022cb32db-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, winter, fennel, heavy cream, panko, parmesan, white beans, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 703}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 426, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "766 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons olive oil", "2 large fennel bulbs (about 2 pounds)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 (14-ounce) cans white beans, such as cannellini, great Northern or navy", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons juice (from 1 lemon)", "1/2 cup panko", "1/2 packed cup finely grated Parmesan (about 1 ounce)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
