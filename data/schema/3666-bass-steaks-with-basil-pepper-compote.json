When they are hot, remove the bass from the marinade and grill on each side for 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the bass. After turning the fish, spoon the marinade over the bass and partially cover the grill so that the fish is allowed to smoke. Use a spatula to place each steak and its topping on plates and serve immediately. (If using a broiler, follow the same instructions, broiling the bass on one side, turning it, spooning on the marinade and broiling until done. Allow at least 4 inches between the fish and the flame to avoid burning.)"}]}
