{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cold Soba Noodles With Dipping Sauce", "description": "In Japan, where it gets plenty hot in the summer, cold soba noodles, served with a dipping sauce, are a common snack or light meal. Soba are brown noodles, made from wheat and buckwheat, and the sauce is based on dashi, the omnipresent Japanese stock. \n\nYou would recognize the smell of dashi in an instant, even if you have never knowingly eaten it. It's a brilliant concoction based on kelp, a seaweed and dried bonito flakes. It is also among the fastest and easiest stocks you can make, and its two main ingredients \u2013 which you can buy in any store specializing in Asian foods \u2013 keep indefinitely in your pantry. I would encourage you to try making it, though you can also use chicken stock (or instant dashi, which is sold in the same stores).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/19/dining/19COOKING-SOBANOODLES1/19COOKING-SOBANOODLES1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, noodles", "keywords": "main course, side dish, soba noodles, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 295}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 233, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1411 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1 cup dashi or chicken stock", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "2 tablespoons mirin or 1 tablespoon honey mixed with 1 tablespoon water", "8 ounces soba noodles", "Finely grated or minced ginger,", "Minced scallions or toasted sesame seeds for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt it.
