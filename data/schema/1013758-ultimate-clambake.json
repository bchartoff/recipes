Few meals are more beautiful than a well-executed clambake. And because demanding culinary tasks are in vogue, at least for a certain hard-working segment of the sustainable-food set, it seems like the right moment for a clambake revival.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/dining/clam/clam-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "new england", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 21}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 747, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "97 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "2913 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds waxy potatoes", "Salt", "6 pounds hard-shell clams, preferably littleneck or cherrystone, well scrubbed", "6 pounds mussels, well scrubbed", "8 to 12 ears fresh corn", "8 to 12 small lobsters", "1 cup (2 sticks) butter, for serving", "Lemon wedges for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Before you leave the house, put the potatoes and a few large pinches of salt in a very large pot and add water to cover; bring to a boil and cook until they are about half done, 10 to 15 minutes.
