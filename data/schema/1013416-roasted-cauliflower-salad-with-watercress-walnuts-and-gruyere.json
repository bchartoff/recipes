{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Cauliflower Salad With Watercress, Walnuts and Gruy\u00e8re", "description": "You can make this kind of salad with almost any vegetable that won\u2019t wilt or burn when subjected to a copious slick of oil and a blast of high heat. Broccoli, brussels sprouts, beets, parsnips, sweet potatoes, winter squash and rutabagas all work well. One of the best vegetables for this salad, though, is cauliflower. The florets turn juicy and tender in the center while crisping and browning around the edges, and cauliflower\u2019s mild flavor is amenable enough to pair nicely with almost anything else you toss in the bowl.\n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/10/dining/10cauliflower/10cauliflower-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "cauliflower, watercress, gluten-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 504}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 387, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "574 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets", "6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon pepper", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "2 bunches watercress, large stems removed", "1/4 pound Gruy\u00e8re, diced or grated (about 1 cup)", "2/3 cup toasted walnuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
