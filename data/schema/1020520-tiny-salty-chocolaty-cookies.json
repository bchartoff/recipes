Adapted from \"Nothing Fancy\" by Alison Roman (Clarkson Potter, 2019), these cookies require no special equipment, fancy techniques or chilling time, which means that even if you bake only once a year, you can still make these. Lightly sweet and definitely salty, it's ideal for the end of a meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/07Romanrex4a/merlin_162114405_2dbe0cb5-7085-4e8b-8bc1-f528183763ac-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "almond, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder, hazelnut, pistachio, walnut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1297}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 stick)", "2 1/2 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (it's worth investing in high-quality cocoa powder, since that\u2019s mostly what you\u2019ll be tasting here)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 large egg whites", "1 large egg", "8 ounces bittersweet chocolate (at least 67 percent cacao), chopped", "1/2 cup finely chopped hazelnuts, almonds, pistachios, pecans or walnuts (optional)", "Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon or Jacobsen"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
