Keep that in mind as your roll, stuff and fold these little dumplings, whose recipe is adapted from the \"true and authentic\" version codified by the Confraternita del Tortellino and notarized by the Bologna Chamber of Commerce. While tortellini are traditionally served as a middle course in a light meat brodo, they'll make a fine main course when tossed with a simple tomato sauce and topped off with a light grating of Parmesan. This version yields enough for leftover pasta and sauce. Freeze them both separately when you're done for a comforting meal in the days and weeks to come. hen you're done for a comforting meal in the days and weeks to come.
