{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Ganache", "description": "Ganache is the French term for the luscious combination of chocolate and cream, and it makes a strategic addition to any dessert playbook. When it\u2019s hot and pourable, it\u2019s a classic companion to ice cream. Warm, you can pour or pipe it over a cake, cupcakes or cookies; it will set to a soft, rich glaze. Let it cool to room temperature and whip it in a mixer to make a fluffy frosting. Or chill it, then roll into balls and dust with cocoa powder to make truffles. This sauce has a slightly more adult flavor than the ice-cream-parlor standard; coffee will do that to a dessert. Leave it out if you prefer. Also note that bittersweet chocolate will deliver a stronger, sharper chocolate taste than semi-sweet.\n\nRefrigerate leftovers in a jar; it will keep indefinitely. To rewarm, place the jar in a saucepan half-filled with simmering water, or uncover and heat in microwave at low heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/26/multimedia/recipelab-custard/recipelab-custard-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, for one", "keywords": "chocolate, espresso, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 317}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 273, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "23 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, broken into pieces", "3 tablespoons  espresso, strong coffee  or water", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 cup sugar (confectioners\u2019, granulated or light brown)", "3/4 cup heavy cream, preferably not ultrapasteurized", "1 pinch coarse salt, more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a heavy saucepan, combine all ingredients and melt together over very low heat, stirring.
