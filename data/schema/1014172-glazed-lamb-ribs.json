{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Glazed Lamb Ribs", "description": "This is a recipe loosely based on one for a snack that used to be served at DBGB, Daniel Boulud\u2019s giddy sausage-and-beer restaurant on the Bowery in Manhattan: crunchy little nuggets of small-boned lamb breast served with a pale yogurt sauce with a mild pepper kick under a zing of lemon zest. You can divide the cooking in two if you like, roasting the meat on one day, then finishing it on a grill or under a broiler a day or so later. And you can bail on the sprinkle if it's too much work. But not the glaze and not the yogurt!
