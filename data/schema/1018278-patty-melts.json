{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Patty Melts", "description": "As great dinner sandwiches go, it is hard to beat patty melts: ground beef, Swiss cheese and caramelized onions griddled on rye bread until they become crisp, oozing packages of salty-sweet delight. This recipe for them, which riffs on the ones served at Tiny Naylor\u2019s drive-in restaurant in Los Angeles in the 1950s, is about as traditional as you can get \u2013 luscious enough that they don\u2019t require condiments. Between the butter and the onions and the cheese, the sandwiches makes their own. Undercook the burger patties slightly before assembly, so they finish while you\u2019re griddling the sandwiches at the end.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/04/magazine/04patty2/04patty2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches", "keywords": "ground beef, onion, swiss cheese", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 222}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 841, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "65 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "47 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "sodiumContent": "776 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "3 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 1/2 pounds ground beef, at least 20 percent fat", "8 slices seeded rye bread", "8 slices Swiss cheese, approximately 1/2 pound"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Caramelize onions.
