{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chilled Cucumber Soup With Avocado Toast", "description": "A chilled cucumber soup, whirled together in the blender to serve as an instant dinner, is one of the quiet rewards of midsummer. The trick to making it hearty enough is to not stint on the seasonings, especially when something as mild as cucumber is the main ingredient. Garlic, plenty of herbs, jalape\u00f1o and anchovy add plenty of flavor, while buttermilk contributes a creamy, light texture. You could serve this with nothing more than some crusty or toasted bread on the side and be satisfied, but a topping of soft avocado dressed with a little lemon juice and feta cheese fills out the meal nicely. And the muted green colors of avocado toast and cucumber soup look as cooling as they taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/23/dining/23dinner/23dinner-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, soups and stews", "keywords": "avocado, bread, cucumber, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 701}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 235, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "729 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound cucumbers, peeled, halved lengthwise and seeded", "2 cups buttermilk (or use 1 1/2 cups plain yogurt plus 1/4 cup water)", "1 large garlic clove, peeled and smashed", "2 anchovy fillets (optional)", "2 small whole scallions, trimmed", "1/2 jalape\u00f1o, seeded, deveined and chopped", "1/2 cup packed mixed fresh herbs (like mint, parsley, dill, tarragon, basil and cilantro)", "1/2 teaspoon sherry or white wine vinegar, more to taste", "3/4 teaspoon kosher sea salt, plus more to taste", "4 slices baguette or other bread, toasted", "1 avocado, pitted, peeled and thinly sliced", "1/2 lemon", "2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 ear of corn, shucked, kernels sliced off", "Fresh dill, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a blender or food processor, combine cucumber, buttermilk, garlic, anchovy, scallions, jalape\u00f1o, fresh herbs, sherry vinegar and salt.
