{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arroz Con Pollo Risotto", "description": "Why should anyone raise an eyebrow if an American chef decides to combine the best of an Italian cooking technique with a deservedly popular Spanish recipe? Anyone who says this Spanish-Italian creation is not authentic need only go in search of the only authentic recipe for arroz con pollo, or rice with chicken. For the Spanish-Italian variation, thanks go to Larry Wolhandler, the owner of Painter's Tavern in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y. He is also responsible for its unwieldy name, arroz con pollo risotto, or rice with chicken rice. But the idea is clear: the ingredients are Spanish, the method of cooking the rice Italian. The result, with a few alterations, is a handsome and quick meal that would be complemented by a salad of orange slices and red onions with a few dribbles of olive oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Marian Burros"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/18/dining/18COOKING-ARROZ-CON-POLLO/18COOKING-ARROZ-CON-POLLO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mexican, spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, one pot", "keywords": "arborio rice, chicken breast, jalape\u00f1o, dairy-free, gluten-free, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 447}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 709, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "85 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1788 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 4 cups chicken stock or broth", "2 tablespoons good-quality olive oil", "2 medium-size onions, chopped coarse", "3 large cloves garlic, minced", "1 teaspoon turmeric", "1 4-ounce can chopped mild jalapeno peppers", "1 pound boneless and skinless chicken breasts, cut in fine strips", "1 cup arborio rice", "6 small chopped fresh plum tomatoes (or one 14-ounce can crushed or chopped plum tomatoes)", "5 or 6 ounces peas, at room temperature", "Salt to taste, if desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat chicken stock and let simmer while preparing the rest of the recipe."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a heavy pan large enough to hold remaining ingredients.
