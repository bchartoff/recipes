{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Canlis Salad", "description": "Canlis, a longtime Seattle institution, floats high above Lake Union. A menu highlight is the Canlis salad, which is in some measure a basic steakhouse salad: chopped romaine with bacon and croutons and cherry tomatoes, all cloaked in a thick, lemony dressing that recalls Caesar (you all did love him once, and not without cause). But a strong scent of the Middle East flows through it as well, courtesy of the Canlis clan\u2019s roots in Greece and Lebanon, with heaps of chopped mint and oregano mixed in with the greens. These combine with the bright, eggy taste of the dressing to elevate the entirety far beyond the confines of a salad to be eaten simply with meat and potatoes. A Canlis salad, properly prepared, is a revelation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/03/magazine/03eat1/mag-03eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "bacon, italian bread, romaine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 419}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 386, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "785 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 heads of romaine, outer leaves discarded, chopped", "4 slices bacon, chopped", "1 cup cubed fresh Italian bread", "1 egg", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1/2 cup olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1/2 cup scallions, thinly sliced", "3/4 cup fresh mint, roughly chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves, roughly chopped", "12 cherry tomatoes, halved", "3/4 cup freshly grated Romano cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the lettuce in cold water, dry thoroughly and put in the refrigerator to chill."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pan set over medium-high\nheat, fry the bacon until it is nearly\ncrisp, then remove to a bowl.
