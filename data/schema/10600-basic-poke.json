{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basic Poke", "description": "Poke (pronounced POH-kay), is a Hawaiian raw-fish salad made with marlin and ahi (yellowfin) or aku (skipjack) tuna. I make my own version of poke now, here where I live in Oregon, when the weather is good and hot. I drive over to my local fish market, and pick up some fresh kajiki marlin, which I cut into cubes. I buy my seaweed pickled in a bottle from an Asian food market, and I chop a small bunch with half a white onion, toss the garnish onto the cubed marlin in a stainless-steel bowl, squeeze a teaspoon or two of fresh wasabi onto it and mix in splashes of tamari sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Garrett Hongo"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/23/dining/Basic-Poke/Basic-Poke-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, tuna", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 194, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "302 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds best-quality tuna or marlin, cut into large dice", "1/4 cup minced white onion", "1/4 cup minced scallions", "3 tablespoons reddish-brown seaweed, like limu kohu or ogo (see note)", "1 tablespoon ground kukui nuts (also known as candlenuts; see note)", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the fish, onion, scallions, seaweed and ground kukui nuts and toss gently with a wooden spoon to mix."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drizzle with sesame oil and sprinkle with salt.
