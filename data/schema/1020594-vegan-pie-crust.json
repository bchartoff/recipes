{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Pie Crust", "description": "Shortening replaces butter in this vegan version of traditional pie dough. Because shortening has a higher melting temperature than butter, you can prepare the dough without any sticky disasters. It also bakes into a beautifully tender and not-at-all-soggy crust. When shopping for a shortening, look for one made with coconut oil, palm oil or a combination of the two.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/05/dining/ejm-vegan-pie-crust/ejm-vegan-pie-crust-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "One (9-inch) pie crust", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, dessert, flour, sea salt, shortening", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 28}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams shortening, roughly cut into 1/2-inch cubes, chilled (see Tip 1)", "3 to 4 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk the flour and salt to combine.
