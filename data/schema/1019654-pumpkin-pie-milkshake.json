Add the spices you most like in your pie \u2014 go heavier on the ginger if that\u2019s your thing, or load up on cinnamon \u2014 and adjust the sweetness to your crowd\u2019s tastes. Even if you don\u2019t drink whisky, there\u2019s a time and a place for bourbon, and this is it. Add a splash or two for the adults; they\u2019ll thank you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/sc-pumpkin-pie-milkshake/sc-pumpkin-pie-milkshake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 milkshakes (About 4 1/2 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "bourbon, cinnamon, ginger, pumpkin, vanilla ice cream, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 92}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 249, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "78 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/180 milliliters heavy cream (or whipping cream)", "1 tablespoon cinnamon", "1 teaspoon sugar", "28 ounces/830 milliliters premium vanilla ice cream", "1/3 to 1/2 cup/80 to 120 milliliters milk", "1 cup/240 milliliters pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "2 teaspoons pure maple syrup", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "5 large ice cubes (about 1 cup)", "2 to 4 tablespoons bourbon (optional)", "Caramel sauce (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whip the cream in a medium bowl until it just holds soft peaks (whip in a chilled bowl for faster results).
