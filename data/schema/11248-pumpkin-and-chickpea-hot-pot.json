{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin and Chickpea Hot Pot", "description": "With a bit of red Thai curry paste, some cans of garbanzo beans and coconut milk, regular pumpkin is turned into an aromatic hot pot that can be served as a mildly spiced vegetarian curry, with more paste added for heat rather than warmth, with plain-cooked rice. Or think of it as a rich, chunky soup and pour into bowls and make sure everyone has a crusty wedge or two of good bread to dunk in, absorbing the sweet, spiced juice. This is good, fragrant weeknight cooking. Feel free to substitute butternut squash for the pumpkin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/21/dining/pumpkin-still/pumpkin-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "chickpea, curry paste, pumpkin, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 311}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 868, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "84 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "20 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "sodiumContent": "1431 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 1/2 cups finely chopped onion", "1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste", "2 teaspoons Thai red curry paste, or to taste (available in Asian markets and specialty food stores)", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "2 pounds peeled seeded pumpkin, cut into 1 1/4-inch chunks", "2 15-ounce cans coconut milk", "1 cup homemade or canned chicken or vegetable broth", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "4 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup loosely packed finely chopped cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large wide pan over medium heat, and add oil.
