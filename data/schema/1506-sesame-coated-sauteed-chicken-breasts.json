Sesame was a novel ingredient for him, he wrote in 1981, introduced to him by the cooking of \u201cthe late Virginia Lee, one of the finest Chinese chefs I have ever met. She used a lot of sesame oil and sesame paste in her flavorings, both in main courses and sauces such as that which accompanies a Mongolian hot pot.\u201d Mr. Franey used sesame seeds as a coating quite a bit after that \u2014 on fish fillets, for example \u2014 and here adapted the idea to a main course, using whole, skinned, boned chicken breasts. \u201cThe dish turned out admirably in texture and flavor,\u201d he wrote. Even better, \u201cit is certainly easy to make, involving nothing more than coating the breast halves with the seeds and sauteing them briefly on both sides in butter. There is a final touch, a light \u2018sauce\u2019 made of hazelnut butter to which a dash of lemon juice is added.\u201d (By that, Mr. Franey meant butter that is browned until it is hazelnut in color.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/dining/sesamechicken/sesamechicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, times classics", "keywords": "chicken breast, sesame seeds, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 628}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 370, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "204 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, about 1/4 pounds each, 2 pounds total weight", "Salt to taste, if desired", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "3/4 cup sesame seeds", "7 tablespoons butter, approximately", "Juice of half a lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place each chicken breast half between slices of wax paper or plastic wrap.
