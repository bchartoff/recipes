The result is a creamy and comforting dessert drink, with an almost puddinglike texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/06/dining/video-holiday-drinks-potato/video-holiday-drinks-potato-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, cocktails", "keywords": "rum, sweet potato, winter", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 8-ounce can diced sweet potatoes in light syrup", "2 ounces spiced rum", "1 egg", "1/2 ounce maple syrup, preferably grade B", "Whipped cream, slightly sweetened", "1 cinnamon stick, or pinch ground cinnamon, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Empty the can of sweet potatoes, including syrup, into a blender.
