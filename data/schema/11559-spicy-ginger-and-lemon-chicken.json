It is made with chicken legs that are skinned and then cooked with lemon and orange peels, fresh ginger, chile powder, cumin, cayenne, garlic and apple cider \u2013 a sweet and spicy mixture that pairs beautifully with the rich, dark meat of the chicken. It can be made ahead and reheated, so it makes a perfect dinner party entree.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacques Pepin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-LEMONCHICKEN/19COOKING-LEMONCHICKEN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "chicken, ginger, lemon, orange, fall, winter, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 89}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 612, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "590 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "6 chicken legs (about 4 pounds), skin removed", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon chile powder", "1 teaspoon cumin", "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1 tablespoon flour", "6 peels of lemon, cut off with a vegetable peeler", "6 peels of orange, cut off with a vegetable peeler", "1/4 cup ginger pieces (washed, but not peeled)", "4 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 cup sweet apple cider"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken with salt and pepper.
