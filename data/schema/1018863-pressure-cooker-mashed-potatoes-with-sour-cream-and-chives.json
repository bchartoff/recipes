That said, if you want to bring the fat content down, you can use less butter (as little as 2 tablespoons will still work). But don\u2019t skimp on the sour cream, which is necessary for both flavor and texture.\n\n<i>This is one of <a href=\"/68861692/7716592-melissa-clark-dinner-in-an-instant\">10 recipes</a> from Melissa Clark\u2019s \u201cDinner in an Instant: 75 Modern Recipes for Your Pressure Cooker, Multicooker, and Instant Pot\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2017).</i>\n\n<i>Melissa Clark\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562277/dinner-in-an-instant-by-melissa-clark/9781524762964/\">\u201cDinner in an Instant\u201d</a> is available everywhere books are sold. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Instant-Recipes-Pressure-Multicooker-ebook/dp/B06XK41BQV/?tag=NYTBks-20&ascsubtag=dinnerinstant\">Order your copy today.</a></i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/25/dining/pressurecookermashedpotatoes/pressurecookermashedpotatoes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, cookbook exclusive, vegetables", "keywords": "butter, chives, parmesan, sour cream, yukon gold potato, gluten-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 132}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 269, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "497 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 cup sour cream, at room temperature", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives", "1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put 1 cup of warm water and the 1 tablespoon salt in the pressure cooker and stir until the salt dissolves.
