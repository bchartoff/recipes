{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orecchiette With Corn, Jalape\u00f1o, Feta and Basil", "description": "Sweet, peak season corn is at the heart of this flavorful and simple-to-make summer pasta. The jalape\u00f1o offers a pleasant kick, and the feta cheese tossed in at the end melts slightly, giving the sauce a silky texture. It\u2019s worth seeking out orecchiette here, as it nicely catches the corn kernels, creating perfect bites. If you can\u2019t find it, fusilli or farfalle would work in its place. Serve with a bright, simple salad alongside and fresh fruit for dessert.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/dining/CH_cornpasta_horizontal/CH_cornpasta_horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "corn, feta, jalape\u00f1o, orecchiette, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 825}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 791, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "113 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "760 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound orecchiette", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 jalape\u00f1o, finely chopped", "5 ears corn, shucked and kernels removed (about 3 1/2 to 4 cups kernels)", "Kosher salt", "8 ounces crumbled feta cheese", "1/2 cup torn basil leaves, plus more for serving", "Flaky salt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
