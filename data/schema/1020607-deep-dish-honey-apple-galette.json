{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Deep-Dish Honey Apple Galette", "description": "Like a pie but with only one crust, like a galette but thicker, this deep-dish number is the best of\u00a0all worlds. The buttery crust (made by hand for flakiest results) dramatically envelopes apples that are sweetened mostly with honey. A splash of vinegar is added for acidity, and, of course, there\u2019s a little cinnamon (if you like). Truthfully, any apple is good here, but the tart baking varieties tend to hold their shape and give a bit more structure to the finished dish. Bake in a 9-inch springform pan for tall, festive sides, or a deep-dish 9-inch pie plate for a more rustic feel.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/13/dining/11Romanrex6/merlin_161933682_c2bd8537-de78-4ada-bea6-920a330971a5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "apple, honey, sesame seeds, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 734}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\u00a0", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams unsalted butter (3 sticks), chilled, cut into 1-inch pieces\u00a0", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar\u00a0", "1/3 cup ice water, plus more as needed\u00a0", "2 1/2 pounds firm, tart baking apples, cored and thinly sliced (about 8 cups)", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters mild-flavored honey", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar, plus 2 tablespoons for sprinkling", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting\u00a0\u00a0", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 large egg", "3 tablespoons raw white sesame seeds (optional)", "Flaky sea salt\u00a0", "Vanilla ice cream, for serving\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Combine flour, sugar and kosher salt in a large bowl, and use your hands to mix well."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the butter to the bowl, and use your palms and fingertips to smash the pieces into the flour until you\u2019ve got large, flat butter pieces that are evenly distributed among the flour.
