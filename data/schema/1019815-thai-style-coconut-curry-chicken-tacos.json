{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thai-Style Coconut Curry Chicken Tacos", "description": "This weeknight chicken dish takes advantage of super flavorful jarred curry paste and pairs it with silky coconut milk to create a meal that comes together in just 20 minutes. Each step in this deceptively simple dish coaxes maximum flavor out of relatively few ingredients: Toasting the curry paste in the pan concentrates its taste, searing the chicken in the mixture ensures it's properly coated, and simmering in creamy coconut milk tenderizes the meat. A splash of lime juice and a spoonful of pico de gallo brighten and lighten the rich curry. Fold the mixture into tacos or try the curry chicken as a topping for grain bowls, cauliflower rice, saut\u00e9ed broccoli or leafy greens.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/dining/Thai-Coconut-Curry-Chicken-Tacos/Thai-Coconut-Curry-Chicken-Tacos-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, tacos", "keywords": "chicken thighs, coconut milk, curry paste, lime, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 110}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 406, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "733 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons canola oil", "3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "Salt and pepper", "1/4 cup unsweetened full-fat coconut milk", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from approximately 2 limes), plus wedges for serving", "1 large tomato, finely chopped (about 2 cups)", "1/2 cup finely chopped red onion", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems", "8 (6-inch) corn tortillas", "1 avocado, sliced (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over low heat.
