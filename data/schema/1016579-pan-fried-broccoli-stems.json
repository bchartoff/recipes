{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Fried Broccoli Stems", "description": "This was an experiment and now it is a keeper. Peel broccoli stems, slice them thin, and pan-fry in hot oil just until the slices are charred on the edges, then flip over and brown for just a little bit of time on the other side. If you do this just right, the medallions will have edges that are slightly crispy with that wonderful fried flavor, and tender interiors. With a little salt (or even without) they are irresistible. One stem\u2019s worth of medallions will disappear quickly, so count on 1 per person (at least!). Although you will use a fair amount of oil for frying, it doesn\u2019t all get absorbed by the broccoli stems.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/17/science/17recipehealth/17recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 167}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 143, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "185 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 to 8 thick broccoli stems", "About 4 tablespoons grape seed oil or olive oil", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel broccoli stems and slice crosswise, very thin, about 1/8 inch.
