You can make the dough in the food processor (do not overprocess), but if you\u2019re willing to incorporate the butter by hand it is of course fine to do it in a bowl. You\u2019re looking for a slightly sticky but not messy dough; start with a half cup of cream and increase it as needed. Serve the baked scones warm, with the best jam you can lay your hands on, and a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, mascarpone or, if you can find it, clotted cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/28/dining/recipes-englishscones/recipes-englishscones-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 scones", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, quick", "keywords": "butter, cake flour, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 744}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 247, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "151 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups cake flour, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "3 tablespoons sugar", "5 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces", "1 egg", "1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream, more for brushing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
