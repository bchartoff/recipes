{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kaffir Lime Meringue Cakes With Lime-Scented Papaya", "description": "Meringue has long been a byproduct of other desserts, an economical way to use up leftover egg whites. This recipe comes from Pichet Ong, the former pastry chef at Spice Market. \n\nMr. Ong whipped egg whites with a small amount of confectioners\u2019 sugar and powdered kaffir lime leaves (made by drying them in the microwave, then mashing them through a sieve). He opted for small, loose piles of meringue and used a spoon to form a well at the center, as you would for mashed potatoes, and baked them using the same method as the torte. Into the well he spooned a tart lime custard (which he also makes in the microwave \u2014 he likes the microwave) and a papaya salad seasoned with Thai chilies and crunchy flakes of Maldon sea salt. \u201cThe sweetness is not a problem when your palate is pulled in different directions,\u201d he added.\n\nThe meringue cushions all of the strong flavors, and the leftover egg yolks are used in the custard. Home economists, you may sleep soundly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/29/dining/Kaffir-Lime-Meringue/Kaffir-Lime-Meringue-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "dessert, lime, meringue, papaya, winter", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 355, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "482 milligrams", "sugarContent": "48 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup confectioners' sugar", "4 large eggs, separated", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "1 cup sugar", "3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons butter", "1 1/2 cups finely diced (1/4 inch) papaya", "1 teaspoon lime zest", "1/4 teaspoon minced Thai chili", "Maldon sea salt", "4 fresh kaffir lime leaves or the finely grated zest of 1 lime"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
