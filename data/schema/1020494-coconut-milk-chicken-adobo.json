{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Milk Chicken Adobo", "description": "When I left home, adobo was a dish I could cook off the top of my head. The name was bestowed by Spanish colonizers, referring to the use of vinegar and seasonings to preserve meat, but the stew existed long before their arrival. It is always made with vinegar, and often soy sauce, but there are as many adobo recipes as there are Filipino cooks. In this version, coconut \u2014 present in three forms: milk, oil and vinegar \u2014 brings silkiness and a hint of elegance. Every ingredient announces itself; none are shy. The braised whole peppercorns pop in your mouth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Angela Dimayuga"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipinorex5-adobo/merlin_160617717_fd914956-d1b1-4f42-8043-9a6748a56183-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, grains and rice, one pot, poultry, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken drumsticks, coconut milk, coconut vinegar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1197}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons coconut oil", "15 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns, plus 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken drumsticks and thighs", "1 cup unsweetened coconut milk", "1/2 cup coconut vinegar", "1/2 cup soy sauce", "8 fresh bay leaves", "Cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat the coconut oil over medium-high until shimmering.
