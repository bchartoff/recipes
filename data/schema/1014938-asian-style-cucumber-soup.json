I believe this Asian take on cucumber soup blows away the \u201cclassic\u201d dairy-based version. \n\nThis time of year is perfect for making dishes with farmers\u2019 market produce. When you see mini-cucumbers, white eggplants, shell beans, baby squash, multicolored carrots and greens whose names you don\u2019t even know, it\u2019s time to go shopping. \n\nNot coincidentally, when you find those vegetables, you\u2019ll also discover herbs, in bushels: mint, parsley, cilantro, basil, chives, oregano, marjoram and more. Thus you will have two of the four necessary ingredients for making vegetable-based summer meals.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, soups and stews", "keywords": "cucumber", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 107, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "922 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium cucumbers", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons rice-wine orwhite-wine vinegar", "1 small chili, stemmed, seededand minced, or 1/4 teaspoon cayenne,or to taste", "2 teaspoons sugar", "3 cups chicken stock, chilled", "1/2 cup minced scallions, both whiteand green parts", "1 cup chopped watercress orarugula (optional)", "1 cup roughly chopped cilantro, mint,Thai basil or a combination."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel cucumbers, then cut them in\nhalf lengthwise.
