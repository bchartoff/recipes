{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pineapple Express", "description": "With its understated, background fruit notes, Plantation Pineapple Rum Stiggins\u2019 Fancy can easily be used in a wide variety of classic cocktail recipes without upsetting the drink\u2019s balance. It makes a good old-fashioned, rum sour or El Presidente. The Pineapple Express, created by Freddie Sarkis of the Broken Shaker in Chicago, is simply a daiquiri with a split of pineapple rum and rhum agricole doing the work usually done by a white rum. The combination adds more richness and character to the drink, though you may not notice the pineapple until the second or third sip. That\u2019s a testimony to the subtlety of the cocktail.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/dining/08PINEAPPLE3/08PINEAPPLE3-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "rum", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 45}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces Plantation Pineapple Rum Stiggins' Fancy", "3/4 ounce 100 proof rhum agricole, preferably Neisson", "3/4 ounce fresh lime juice", "1/2 ounce simple syrup (see note)", "Grapefruit twist"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the pineapple rum, rhum agricole, lime juice and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker three-quarters filled with ice.
