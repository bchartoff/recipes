But it has indubitably increased the snacking that goes on afterward, said Alexander Figura, the chef of Lower48 Kitchen in Denver. That post-meal, late-night snacking has taken on a different kind of intensity now that the munchies are involved. \u201cStoned people gravitate to more extreme flavors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want something very savory or very sweet, or both at the same time.\u201d \n\nHis recipe for sticky pecan pie bites dunked into leftover turkey gravy \u2014 an after-hours snack among chefs he knows \u2014  hits those notes perfectly. The bite-size, bourbon-spiked pecan bars work on their own, too: no gravy or cannabis required. You can bake them up to 5 days in advance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19COLORADO/19COLORADO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "2 dozen bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, pies and tarts", "keywords": "bourbon, gravy, pecan, vanilla, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 226, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "42 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons/170 grams/1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter", "1/3 cup/35 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Pinch salt", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/235 milliliters light corn syrup", "1/2 cup/100 grams light brown sugar", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters heavy cream", "2 tablespoons/30 grams unsalted butter", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters bourbon", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "Pinch salt", "2 cups/200 grams pecan halves", "Leftover turkey gravy, for dipping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together butter, confectioners\u2019 sugar and salt.
