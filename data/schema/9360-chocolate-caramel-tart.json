This recipe, an adaptation of one attributed to the pastry chef Claudia Fleming, came to The Times in a 2000 article by Amanda Hesser about the development of that very trend, and it is a perfect example of how it's done right. Layers of silky caramel and dark chocolate ganache topped with a sprinkling of crunchy, snow-white fleur de sel make this an unforgettable combination of flavors and textures.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/09/dining/09COOKING-CHOCTART3/09COOKING-CHOCTART3-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "10-inch tart (12 to 16 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "caramel, chocolate dough, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1187}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 408, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "243 milligrams", "sugarContent": "42 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup (1 stick) salted butter, at room temperature", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar", "1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa", "1 large egg yolk", "3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "2 cups sugar", "1/2 cup water", "1/4 cup corn syrup", "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "2 tablespoons creme fraiche (available at specialty food markets)", "PInch of salt", "3 1/2 ounces extra-bittersweet chocolate (70 to 85%), chopped", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "Fleur de sel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare chocolate dough: In bowl of an electric mixer, combine the butter, confectioners' sugar and cocoa.
