{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Duck Legs With Plums and Red Wine", "description": "This is a deep, dark, flavorful braise, perfect for cool weather. The plums and red wine add body, sweetness and a touch of acidity to the rich sauce. Look for small Pekin (sometimes called Long Island) duck legs, about 8 ounces each; they cook more quickly and are more tender than the larger Muscovy duck legs some butchers carry. If small duck legs are unavailable, chicken legs may be substituted. You may be tempted to brown the legs in the Dutch oven rather than the skillet called for in Step 2, but a roomy skillet (cast iron if possible) does the job better and saves time in the long run \u2014 you can brown more legs at a time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/19/dining/19KITCHEN-DUCKLEGS1/19KITCHEN-DUCKLEGS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "duck leg, pistachio, plum, red wine, star anise, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 97}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 duck legs, about 4 pounds", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon ground clove", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "Pinch of cayenne", "2 cups diced red onion", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 cup dry red wine", "4 cups chicken broth", "1 (1-inch) piece of cinnamon stick", "2 pieces star anise", "1 bay leaf", "2 pounds small purple free-stone plums, halved, pits removed", "1 tablespoon butter", "1/2 cup chopped parsley", "3 tablespoons finely sliced chives", "1/4 cup roughly chopped pistachios", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay the duck legs on a baking sheet in one layer.
