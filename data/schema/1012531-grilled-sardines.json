Nutritionists say we should eat more, that many types of fish are nutritious and contain fats that seem to protect the heart.  I know from experience that many of them can make for fine meals.  \n \nIf you\u2019ve only had sardines from a can, you may turn up your nose at them. Fresh ones will change your mind. Brush them with olive oil, toss a few sprigs of rosemary onto a hot grill, and grill them. Sardines take two to three minutes to grill and about that long to eat. They\u2019re a rare treat and a great nutritional package, containing omega-3 fats, selenium, vitamin B12, calcium, niacin and phosphorus.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/05/11/health/11recipehealth/11recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low-carb, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, main course, sardines, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 91}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 160, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "197 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["24 medium or large sardines, cleaned", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "A handful of fresh rosemary sprigs", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a hot grill, making sure the grill is oiled.
