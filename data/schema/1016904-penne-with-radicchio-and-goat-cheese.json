{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Penne With Radicchio and Goat Cheese", "description": "I saut\u00e9 most of the radicchio in this recipe in olive oil with garlic and chile flakes, but I hold some back to add at the end for color and texture. The cooked radicchio sweetens a bit but still has a bitter edge. Just before tossing with the cooked pasta I ladle in some cooking water from the pasta, which you should be careful not to over-salt, add the goat cheese and stir until it has melted. The result is irresistible. It will work just as well with other bitter greens like endive and dandelions, as well as with blanched greens like kale.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/24/health/24bitterspenne/24bitterspenne-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 104}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 473, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "72 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "666 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds radicchio (2 large or 4 smaller)", "Salt to taste", "3/4 pound penne", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "3 ounces soft goat cheese (to taste)", "2 tablespoons minced chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Quarter and core radicchio, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch wide strips.
