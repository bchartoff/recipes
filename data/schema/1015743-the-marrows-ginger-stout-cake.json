{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Marrow's Ginger Stout Cake", "description": "This is a rich, fragrant ginger cake with a crunchy raw-sugar coating and moist crumb. The combination of grated fresh ginger root and powdered ginger, along with black pepper and cloves, gives it a particularly intense spice flavor. Make sure to use a good stout here. Since you\u2019ll only use part of a bottle, choose one you\u2019d be happy to finish off while the cake is in the oven. \n\nAs with most gingerbread, this is a good keeping cake, and can be made a day or two ahead. Store it wrapped in foil at room temperature. Then serve it with cream whipped with a little cr\u00e8me fraiche or sour cream for tartness, which will offset all that crunchy sugar coating the cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/26/dining/26Takeaway/26Takeaway-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, ginger", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1062}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 492, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "82 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "136 milligrams", "sugarContent": "64 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "125 grams raw (Demerara) sugar (1/2 cup)", "1 cup stout", "1 cup molasses", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "240 grams all-purpose flour (2 cups)", "1 tablespoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon allspice", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "210 grams dark brown sugar, lightly packed (1 cup)", "200 grams granulated sugar (1 cup)", "3/4 cup safflower oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
