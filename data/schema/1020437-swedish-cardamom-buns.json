The best place to try it would be at Fabrique, a Stockholm bakery that has opened a location in New York. Here, the knotted pastry is at its buttery finest, imbued with the piney warmth of the spice. The second-best place to try it would be at home, in your own kitchen, where, with a few adjustments, you can replicate the original. Yours will use less potent forms of cardamom \u2014 the store-bought ground version and the whole pods, instead of the fresh, coarsely ground seeds painstakingly removed from their shells \u2014 and may look slightly less put-together than those shaped by the professionals. And, unlike cinnamon rolls, these cardamom buns won\u2019t rise as tall or be as fluffy \u2014 but they will taste so good that no one will care.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Charlotte Druckman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/dining/10bunrex/10bunrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "16 to 18 buns", "recipeCuisine": "scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "pastries, project", "keywords": "active dry yeast, butter, cardamom, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 515}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters whole milk", "2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (from one 1/4-ounce packet)", "4 cups/510 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons/90 grams granulated sugar", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick), softened", "2 tablespoons ground cardamom (see Note)", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/250 grams unsalted butter (2 1/4 sticks), slightly softened", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large egg", "20 green cardamom pods", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a small saucepan set over medium-low heat, bring the milk to 105 to 110 degrees.
