Sesame has long been shunned in American desserts, but its addition to a confection can add a nutty, salty undertone, and sesame desserts are now popping up all over the place. These chocolate chip cookies, developed by Ms. Oron, are a great place to start for the home baker seeking more sesame. Rich, savory and sweet, they are one of the rare variations that are just as good as the original.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/14SESAME6/14SESAME6-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 to 18 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "chocolate chips, tahini, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2607}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 306, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "157 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces/113 grams unsalted butter at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters tahini, well stirred", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "1 egg yolk", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/150 grams all-purpose flour, or matzo cake meal (See tip)", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 3/4 cups/230 grams chocolate chips or chunks, bittersweet or semisweet", "Flaky salt, like fleur de sel or Maldon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter, tahini and sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
