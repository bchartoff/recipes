{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Cod Broiled With Miso", "description": "Black cod with miso was not invented by Nobu Matsuhisa, the chef at Nobu in TriBeCa, but he certainly popularized it. His time-consuming recipe, which calls for soaking the fish in a sweet miso marinade for a couple of days, is a variation on a traditional Japanese process that uses sake lees, the sweet solids that remain after making sake, to marinate fish. If you broil black cod with nothing but salt, you already have a winning dish. If you broil it with miso \u2013 the intensely salty paste made from fermented soybeans \u2013 along with some mirin and quite a bit of sugar, you create something stunningly delicious. And no long marination is necessary.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/25/dining/25COOKING-FISHWITHSAUCE2/25COOKING-FISHWITHSAUCE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "black cod fillets, fish, mirin, miso, low-fat, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 710}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 419, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "2672 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup sugar", "1 cup miso, preferably dark", "1/2 cup mirin, sake or white wine", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds black cod fillets (skin may be on or off)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat broiler; set rack 3 to 4 inches from heat source.
