{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cha Yen (Thai Iced Tea)", "description": "This homemade Thai iced tea gets its complex flavor from black tea, rooibos tea, star anise and cloves, and its sweetness from condensed milk. Adapted from the cookbook \u201cBangkok\u201d by Leela Punyaratabandhu, this version is hardly typical: Most Thai iced tea sold on the streets of Bangkok \u2014 or in Thai restaurants stateside \u2014 contains an immoderate amount of sweetened condensed milk and uses a store-bought mix, which contains food coloring. The tea blend used here is intense on its own, but mellowed by ice and milk. Chill the tea fully before pouring it over ice so its flavors don\u2019t get diluted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/14/dining/aw-thai-iced-tea/aw-thai-iced-tea-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "anise, cloves, condensed milk, half and half, sugar, tea, vanilla", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 178}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons loose red rooibos tea leaves (or the contents of 10 rooibos tea bags)", "3 tablespoons loose black tea leaves (or the contents of 7 black tea bags)", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "10 star anise pods, broken into pieces or roughly chopped", "10 whole cloves", "1/2 cup half-and-half", "1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "Ice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add 4 cups water to a medium saucepan.
