This may be doubly true for Swedish ginger cookies, a recipe that I have cherished for years, but I often feel it should come with a special warning. The principal ingredient in a batch of Swedish ginger cookies \u2014 the one that really does the trick \u2014 is 3/4 of a cup of bacon fat. You can never be too certain these days about what people will allow themselves to enjoy. Their ideas about what is good for them may be circumscribed by their upbringing, their religion or their proximity to a pig. However, I suspect that the Swedish cook who came up with this recipe was simply hemmed in by her larder. She had a pan of drippings and some extra sugar and spices, and she made a thin, brown cookie that tasted sweetly of smoke.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Cathy Horyn"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/02/dining/Swedish-Ginger/Swedish-Ginger-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, bacon fat, ginger, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 150}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 300, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "295 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup bacon fat, cooled (from 1 1/2 to 2 pounds Oscar Mayer bacon)", "1 cup sugar, plus 1/4 cup for dusting the cookies", "4 tablespoons dark molasses", "1 large egg", "2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
