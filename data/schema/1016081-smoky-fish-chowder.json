{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Fish Chowder", "description": "This chowder is a more complex and smoky interpretation of a classic New England fish chowder. Made with hot smoked paprika and a little Vermouth or white wine, it\u2019s got more spunk than a simpler, more authentic recipe, without losing the spirit of the sea. If you can\u2019t find fish stock, you can substitute bottled clam juice, or even a good, flavorful vegetable stock. Either way, you\u2019ll end up with perfectly balanced bowl of soup that needs nothing more than perhaps a few crackers on the side to make it shine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/26/dining/26dinner/26dinner-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "bacon, fish, potato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 607}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 410, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "979 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces bacon (about 3 to 4 slices), diced\n", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n", "2 medium leeks, white and light- green parts, thinly sliced\n", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed\n", "1/4 teaspoon hot smoked paprika\n", "1/4 cup dry white vermouth or white wine\n", "2 cups fish stock, store-bought or homemade ", "1/2 pound fingerling potatoes, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds\n", "3 thyme sprigs\n", "2 cups whole milk\n", "10 ounces flaky white fish, such as flounder or cod, cut into 2-inch chunks\n"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a heavy pot over medium-high heat, brown bacon until crisp, about 5 minutes.
