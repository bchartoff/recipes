{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spam Musubi", "description": "Spam, the love-it-or-hate-it canned ham, was introduced in 1937 and gained popularity during World War II, when more than 150 million pounds were shipped to American troops overseas. Soldiers introduced it to locals, who used the product to create spin-offs of regional dishes like Japanese onigiri and Korean budae jjigae. According to Hormel Foods Corporation, residents of Hawaii eat more Spam than those of any other state. A popular way to eat it there is in the tradition of Japanese omusubi: Stack a pan-fried slice of Spam and a rice patty and wrap a piece of roasted nori around it. This version of the dish is adapted from \u201cAloha Kitchen: Recipes From Hawai\u2018i,\u201d a cookbook of classic Hawaiian dishes by Alana Kysar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kiera Wright-Ruiz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/08/dining/kw-spam-musubi/kw-spam-musubi-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for one, for two, lunch, quick, weekday, grains and rice, meat", "keywords": "furikake, mirin, nori, spam, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspooon mirin (optional)", "1 to 2 teaspoons neutral oil, like canola or vegetable", "1 (12-ounce) can Spam, cut horizontally\u00a0into 8 slices", "3 sheets roasted sushi nori, cut into thirds crosswise", "2 teaspoons furikake", "5 to 6 cups cooked short-grain white rice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk the soy sauce, sugar and mirin (if using).

Place a Spam musubi maker mold over it, in the middle, then place a slice of Spam into the mold. (If you don\u2019t have a mold, you can line a clean Spam can with plastic wrap instead, and place a slice of Spam at the bottom.) Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon furikake over the Spam, then fill the mold or can with a generous mound of rice. Press the rice firmly with the musubi maker press or with your hands until it is 3/4- to 1-inch thick, adding more rice as needed."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use the press to hold the rice down with one hand and pull the mold upward to unmold the musubi with your other hand. (If you\u2019re using the Spam can, gently lift the Spam and rice out of the can by gently pulling on both sides of the plastic wrap.) Wrap the nori around the Spam-rice stack, bringing both ends of the strip to the middle, folding one over the other, and flipping it over so the seam is down and the Spam is facing up. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve immediately or wrap with plastic wrap to take with you on the go."}]}
