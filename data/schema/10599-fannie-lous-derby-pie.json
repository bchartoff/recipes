Only Kern\u2019s Kitchen Inc. can make a true \u201cDerby-Pie\u201d \u2014 the creators of the dessert trademarked the term before partnering with the Kentucky Derby Festival \u2014 but while the naming practices are sticky, the concept is universal: a chocolate-chip and walnut-laden batter baked in a pie crust. This version is adapted from author ZZ Packer, who shared her great-aunt\u2019s recipe. Many versions exist \u2014 some spike the batter with bourbon; others swap in varying nuts or crown the pie with whipped cream \u2014 but Fannie Lou\u2019s is easy to assemble, and makes a lasting impression.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Matt Lee and Ted Lee"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/23/dining/Almost-Derby-Pie/Almost-Derby-Pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, pie crust, semisweet chocolate chips, walnut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 191}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 593, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "191 milligrams", "sugarContent": "36 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12319-all-purpose-pie-dough\">(see recipe)</a>", "4 tablespoons butter, melted", "2 large eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup flour", "3/4 cup chopped walnuts", "3/4 cup semisweet-chocolate chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
