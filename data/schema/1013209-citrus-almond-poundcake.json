{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Citrus-Almond Poundcake", "description": "This poundcake is richer, moister and more flavorful than any you\u2019ve tasted, and it\u2019s not difficult to make. (Much of it is done in the food processor; do not pulse more than you must.) The consistency and flavor rely on the almond paste in the batter, and a simple soak of lemon juice, orange juice and sugar; the cake acts like a sponge, absorbing the sweetened citrus juice. A word of advice about this or any other Bundt cake: butter and flour the pan well. Even nonstick Bundt pans can be tricky. There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than having your cake fall partly out, leaving the pretty top bit clinging to the pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/poundcake-still/poundcake-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "almond paste, orange juice, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 97}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 496, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "117 milligrams", "sugarContent": "59 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cubed, plus more for pan", "Flour for pan", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice", "1/2 cup fresh orange juice", "3 cups plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "7-ounce tube almond paste", "7 large eggs", "2 teaspoons lemon zest", "2 teaspoons orange zest", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups cake flour", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
