{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tumble-Jumble Strawberry Tart", "description": "I first had a strawberry tart like this one more than 10 years ago at the Paris cafe La Palette, and I\u2019ve been making my own version of it ever since. It\u2019s simply a crust slicked with some jam and then topped with an abundance of berries; whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is optional. The recipe is straightforward, but the construction is genius. You bake the crust, which is both crisp and tender, to a beautiful golden color and then set it aside. (Use the scraps of dough to make cookies; sprinkle with sugar before baking.) When you\u2019re ready for dessert, you cut and finish only as many servings as you need, ensuring that the crust will always have great texture and the berries will always be fresh and bright. You could use a store-bought crust, but there are so few components in this dessert, it\u2019s good to make each one count.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/14/magazine/14mag-eat/72e1f453e8d34af9bae7038433405964-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, french", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, pies and tarts", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, strawberries, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 242}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/200 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Grated zest of 1 lemon (optional)", "9 tablespoons/130 grams very cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus additional for greasing", "1 large egg yolk", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/2\u00a0cup/120 milliliters strawberry jam", "1 quart/680 grams fresh strawberries, hulled", "Granulated sugar, as needed (optional)", "Whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the flour, both sugars, salt and lemon zest, if you\u2019re using it, in the bowl of a food processor; pulse to blend.
