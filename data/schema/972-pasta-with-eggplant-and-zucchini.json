Like so many of his dishes, it is at once elegant and easy, and no trouble to put together on a weeknight. Saut\u00e9 the sliced eggplant and zucchini until golden while you make a quick sauce of canned crushed tomatoes, olive oil, garlic and herbs in another pot. Throw everything together, and simmer for about 15 minutes. Toss with cooked pasta and a shower of Parmesan.
