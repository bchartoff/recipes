It is typically flavored with sweet Marsala wine, which has a caramel-like flavor, but other wines or liqueurs may be substituted for variation. In this version, espresso coffee and Cognac are used, and the zabaglione is frozen for several hours or overnight. It\u2019s an easy way to make gelato at home, with a light airy texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/09/dining/zabaglione/zabaglione-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "lunch", "keywords": "cognac, espresso, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 68}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 104, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "11 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 egg yolks", "6 tablespoons sugar", "3/4 cup espresso ", "2 tablespoons Cognac", "Cocoa powder and powdered sugar, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put egg yolks in a medium-size mixing bowl.
