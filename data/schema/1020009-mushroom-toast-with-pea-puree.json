It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nTake a bag of frozen organic peas and heat them in a little bit of boiling water for a couple of minutes to get them warm and cooked through, then drain them off and whiz them in a food processor with a hit of olive oil, some lemon juice and, if you have any, some tarragon leaves, until it resembles a thickish pur\u00e9e. Next, saut\u00e9 a bunch of thick-sliced portobellos (count on about two mushrooms per person) in a lot of butter with a little bit of garlic. Really cook those down. Finally, make toast from hefty slices of your favorite bread, spread them with the pea pur\u00e9e, top with the mushrooms and \u2014 dinner!\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17NORECIPE-MUSHROOM-PEA-PUREE/17NORECIPE-MUSHROOM-PEA-PUREE-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bread, peas, portobello, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
