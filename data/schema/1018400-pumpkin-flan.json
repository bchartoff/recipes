{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Flan", "description": "For many Cubans, flan is a birthright. This version comes from Margarita Velasco, who left Cuba for America when she was 10. She got it from a relative who for years made it when Ms. Velasco and her family would gather for big American-style Thanksgiving dinners. Ms. Velasco makes it with three kinds of squash: butternut, a cooking pumpkin like a calabaza and canned pumpkin. But it works just as well with a mix of pulp from the squash and the pumpkin, which you can get by cutting them into large chunks, seeding them and then roasting or boiling. In a pinch, you could use canned pumpkin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/dining/COOKING-FLAN1/COOKING-CUBAN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cuban", "recipeCategory": "dinner, custards and puddings", "keywords": "butternut squash, eggs, half and half, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "67 milligrams", "sugarContent": "32 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/350 grams granulated sugar, divided", "1 cinnamon stick", "2 cups/473 milliliters half-and-half", "4 large eggs, plus 2 large egg yolks", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice (see note)", "1/8 teaspoon fine salt", "1/2 cup/125 grams pumpkin pur\u00e9e (from a speckled hound, calabaza or other cooking pumpkin)", "1/2 cup/125 grams butternut squash pur\u00e9e (see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the caramel: In a heavy saucepan, mix 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water.
