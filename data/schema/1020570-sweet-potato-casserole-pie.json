{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Casserole Pie", "description": "This showstopping dessert, which is inspired by the classic Thanksgiving side dish, is really a pie baked in a springform pan. (Don\u2019t try it in a pie pan because the filling will likely overflow.) What makes this dessert a winner is the textural contrast between the creamy sweet potato filling, the crisp pecan crust and the gooey marshmallow topping. Here are a few tips for best results: Roast the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them because it enhances their flavor, and use smaller sweet potatoes because they are naturally sweeter than larger varieties. Also, it may seem fussy, but chilling the cooked potatoes, then aggressively whipping them, aerates them, resulting in a silkier texture. Once baked and cooled, refrigerate the pie until right before it\u2019s time to serve.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/dining/jg-sweet-potato-pie/merlin_162370008_82cfc608-d37c-4ebb-b60b-7f9938f06521-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "\u00a0One 9-inch deep-dish pie (about 12 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, pies and tarts", "keywords": "cinnamon, evaporated milk, marshmallow, pecan, sweet potato, vanilla, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 286}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds/900 grams small sweet potatoes, unpeeled", "1 1/2 cups/150 grams pecan halves", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/140 grams packed light brown sugar", "4 tablespoons/60 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), softened", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "6 ounces marshmallows\u00a0(about 27)\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using the tines of a fork, carefully poke holes into the surface of each sweet potato.
