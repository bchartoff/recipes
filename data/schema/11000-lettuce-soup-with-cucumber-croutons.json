{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lettuce Soup With Cucumber Croutons", "description": "Soup is the most versatile of dishes. When it is rough-chunked, thick and hearty, it is a homey supper; when it is smooth and delicate like the lettuce soup here, it is the perfect elegant starter. It also happens to be a wonderful way of using up any stray lettuces in your fridge. You do not want to use anything that is unpalatable, but I often start the week planning to eat a lot of salad and then end it having not lived up to my intentions. This recipe is the perfect way of atoning for that.\n\nThis time of year I especially prefer this soup chilled, which makes life much easier because you can cook it in advance. If cold soup is not your thing, do not panic; it is just as good served at room temperature. Either way, this soup is taken up a few notches by being studded, by some cucumber croutons: small, jade cubes cut like toasted-bread dice, only so much more elegant.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/02/dining/Lettuce-Soup-With-Cucumber-Croutons/Lettuce-Soup-With-Cucumber-Croutons-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 2 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, cucumber, lettuce, gluten-free, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 49, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "228 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons butter", "6 scallions, white part only, finely sliced", "8 new potatoes, peeled and diced", "7 cups chicken or vegetable stock", "1 pound Boston lettuce, roughly chopped", "1/3 to 1/2 cup sour cream", "Salt", "2 tablespoons finely sliced chives", "1 cucumber, peeled, seeded and diced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in a large saucepan, and add scallions.
