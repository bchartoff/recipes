{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Swiss Chard Pasta With Leeks, Tarragon and Lemon Zest", "description": "This creamy vegetarian pasta is hearty enough for chilly temperatures while still nodding toward spring with the addition of bright-green chard, leeks and fresh herbs. For texture, it\u2019s topped with toasted panko, a garnish that can go many ways: Instead of using nutritional yeast, which adds tangy flavor here, you can melt a finely chopped anchovy with the butter and toss it with the panko. You could also add some ground coriander, Italian seasoning or herbes de Provence. Toasted panko, plain bread crumbs or even crushed croutons are a solid back-pocket trick to add crunch to any pasta, especially the creamiest kind. Don\u2019t skip the tarragon and lemon zest garnish, which add a fresh note to an otherwise-rich dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/25/dining/aw-swiss-chard-pasta/merlin_169350135_e79fcb6e-cda0-4d5b-87d6-787b4870fbd1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas, vegetables", "keywords": "chard, chicken stock, garlic, heavy cream, leek, lemon zest, nutritonal yeast, panko, parmesan, pasta, tarragon, thyme, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 433}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound green Swiss chard (1 large bunch), washed and trimmed", "2 large leeks (10 to 12 ounces each)", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons nutritional yeast\u00a0", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves", "2 cups chicken or vegetable stock", "1 cup heavy cream", "16 ounces linguine or fettuccine", "3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan", "Fresh tarragon leaves, for garnish", "1 lemon, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
