{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Big Bowl With Spicy Brown Bean, Squash and Corn Succotash", "description": "This version of succotash is lima-bean-free, with a kick that is a lively contrast to the sweet corn. If you have a problem liking succotash, it\u2019s probably because of the lima beans, which have a mealy consistency that is not to everybody\u2019s taste. What\u2019s not to like, though, if you use another bean? Pintos or borlottis are great, and Good Mother Stallards \nfrom Rancho Gordo are luxurious. This succotash has some spice to it, a nice contrast to the sweet corn. Make sure to hold onto the bean broth. I like bulgur with this, but any grain will work.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/01/science/01recipehealth/01recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "american, southwestern", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 27}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "860 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small red or yellow onion, chopped", "1 1/4 pounds summer squash, diced (about 4 cups)", "Salt to taste", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Kernels from 2 ears corn", "2 serrano or jalape\u00f1o chiles, minced", "Freshly ground pepper", "3 cups cooked brown beans, such as Good Mother Stallards, pintos or borlottis, with broth", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro (more to taste), plus cilantro sprigs for garnish", "4 to 5 cups cooked quinoa, brown rice, wild rice, or bulgur (to taste)", "1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco or feta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a strainer or colander over a bowl and drain beans.
