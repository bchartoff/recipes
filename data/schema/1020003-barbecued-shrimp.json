They\u2019re saut\u00e9ed with salt and pepper, then tossed in butter-mounted Worcestershire sauce with lemon, sometimes with a splash of cream. I crank the oven to 450 degrees and make the sauce on the stovetop: diced shallots saut\u00e9ed in butter, a healthy quarter-cup or so of Worcestershire, a little thyme, paprika and cayenne, some salt and then a whole lot more butter, cut into the pan a knob at a time and whisked into velvet. I add to that a splash of cream and a few more healthy cranks of black pepper. Then I roast the shrimp on a greased pan in the oven under a shower of salt and yet more pepper, and serve it on a warm platter with the sauce spooned over the top. Rice, green beans and plenty of good, crusty bread for mopping up make it an ambrosial meal.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17norecipe-bbqshrimp/merlin_147761865_7cec35e5-b94a-44fc-b10a-beaa3664aaf8-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "main course, shallot, shrimp, thyme", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 350}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
