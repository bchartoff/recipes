This recipe is adapted from the version that was served at Schrafft's, an upscale chain of restaurants popular in the northeast in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nFrank G. Shattuck opened its first location on Broadway in 1898.\n\n''It was a much more genteel time then,'' his great-grandson Frank M. Shattuck said. ''Everyone wore hats and hand-made suits. And if you were a lady, it was safe to sit at the soda fountain and drink gin from a teacup.''\n\nFrank M. has never been in the restaurant business; he is an actor and a tailor specializing in dashing $5,000 suits. One day in 1980 he went into the last remaining Schrafft's -- ''It wasn't really a Schrafft's, just a pizza place with a dirty old sign'' -- and made off with 2,500 recipes from the safe. ''I asked the guy if it was O.K. to take them, and he said yes, and a week later I sent him a bottle of Jack Daniel's.''", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Reynolds"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "chicken stock, lobster, mushroom, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 14}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 865, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "105 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "2761 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cooked lobsters, about 1 1/4 pounds each", "6 tablespoons butter", "1 minced shallot", "1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus more to taste", "3/4 teaspoons paprika", "Pinch cayenne", "Salt and pepper to taste", "6 ounces small white button mushrooms, sliced", "3 tablespoons flour", "1 1/4 teaspoons powdered mustard", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock or mild seafood stock, or a combination", "2/3 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
