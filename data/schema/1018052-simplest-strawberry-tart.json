{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Simplest Strawberry Tart", "description": "This gorgeous tart is adapted from \"Sweeter Off the Vine,\" by Yossy Arefi, a cookbook of fruit desserts for every season. It's an ideal vehicle for the ripest strawberries at the height of the season, a dessert that makes more of a splash than just serving berries and cream but still has that simple charm. The only tricky part is the crust, which could crack as you transfer it to a serving board. But if that happens, don't despair. It's meant to be effortlessly loose and casual, and you can cover the damage with swirls of mascarpone and a blanket of berries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Weinstein"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/13/dining/13COOKBOOK1/13COOKBOOK1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, mascarpone, rye flour, strawberries, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 607}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 351, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "261 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup/85 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/85 grams rye flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar", "9 tablespoons/127 grams very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 large egg, lightly beaten, for egg wash", "1 cup/225 grams mascarpone, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 pound/450 grams small, sweet strawberries", "3 tablespoons high-quality strawberry jam"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: Whisk the flours and salt together in a large bowl.
