{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Swedish Almond Cake", "description": "Fika is the Swedish custom of stopping twice daily for coffee, conversation and a little something sweet; the word was created by flipping the two syllables in kaffe. Minutes after I had a fika in the Stockholm studio of the pastry chef Mia Ohrn, I started thinking about what I\u2019d serve at my own first fika. This cake, so much easier to make than you\u2019d guess by looking at it, has become my favorite. The recipe turns out a moist, buttery, tender cake, which would be lovely as is. But when the cake is half-baked, I cook a mixture of butter, sugar, flour and sliced almonds, spread it over the top (a homage to Sweden\u2019s famous tosca cake), put the pan back in the oven and wait for the mixture to bubble, caramelize and create a shell that is a little chewy, a little crackly and very beautiful. It\u2019s a perfect cake for fika, and great for brunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/12/magazine/12mag-eat/12mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, cakes", "keywords": "almonds, butter, flour, milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1260}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 6 tablespoons/200 grams unsalted butter, melted and lukewarm, plus more unmelted butter for greasing the pan", "2 cups minus 2 tablespoons/240 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters whole milk, lukewarm", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "7 tablespoons/100 grams unsalted butter, cut into small chunks", "3/4 cup/75 grams sliced almonds", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons whole milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to 350 degrees.
