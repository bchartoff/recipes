{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lasagna With Spinach and Wild Mushrooms", "description": "Mushrooms enrich this classic spinach lasagna, a family favorite and a great do ahead dish. I like juicy wild mushrooms like maitakes or oyster mushrooms for this. I also prefer bunch spinach to the baby variety, because baby spinach can be a bit stringy when you cook it (however you will be chopping it and blending it into the ricotta here so perhaps that isn\u2019t such an issue). Before you begin to assemble your lasagna it helps to be organized about the quantities of each element that you will need for the layers. It is very frustrating to get to the last layer of your casserole and not have enough sauce for the top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/23/science/23recipeforhealth/23recipeforhealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 365}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 408, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "817 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound spinach, stemmed and washed in 2 changes water if using bunch spinach, rinsed if using bagged baby spinach", "Salt", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus additional for oiling baking dish", "1/2 pound wild mushrooms, such as oyster mushrooms or maitakes, torn or cut into smaller slices if large or in clumps", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "8 ounces ricotta cheese", "1 egg", "1 tablespoon water", "Pinch of nutmeg", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 1/3 to 2 1/2 cups <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016147-simple-marinara-sauce\">marinara sauce</a> (more to taste)", "7 to 8 ounces no-boil lasagna (depends on the size and shape of your dish)", "4 ounces (1 cup) freshly grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large frying pan over high heat and add the wet spinach.
