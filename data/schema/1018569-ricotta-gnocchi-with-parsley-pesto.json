{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ricotta Gnocchi With Parsley Pesto", "description": "Gnocchi are little savory Italian dumplings, most often served as a  pasta course. They are often made from a dough of potato, egg and flour, but there are many kinds. Some are made with cooked semolina, such as gnocchi alla romana, which are baked with cream and cheese. Fresh ricotta is the secret for these exceedingly light, airy dumplings. Bound with eggs and only a handful of flour, they can be served in broth, with a light tomato sauce, tossed with butter and sage leaves, or with a simple green pesto. Look for  the best fresh ricotta: The low-fat commercial type doesn\u2019t qualify. Drain it well before using, or the dough will be too wet. Put it in a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Use the drained liquid whey in soups or smoothies.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/08/dining/08KITCH1/08KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, garlic, parmesan, parsley, pistachio, rice flour, ricotta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 181}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 327, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "283 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh ricotta, about 2 cups, drained well", "Salt and pepper", "3 or 4 tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "2 eggs, beaten", "1/4 to 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, as needed", "Fine semolina flour or rice flour, for dusting", "3 cups flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems", "1 small garlic clove, minced", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup toasted pistachios, roughly chopped for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put ricotta in a large mixing bowl and season generously with salt and pepper.
