{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon-Raspberry Danish With Mascarpone", "description": "This braiding technique looks fancy, but it couldn\u2019t be easier to achieve. The lemon-raspberry-mascarpone filling is pudding-like, which makes it important to weave the dough as tightly as possible to prevent too much leakage (though a little is to be expected). Let the pastry cool completely before glazing and serving. This allows the glaze and the filling to set properly; impatient slicers will be met with a sloppy filling rather than a creamy one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/15/dining/em-lemon-raspberry-danish/merlin_153567099_ad485161-a939-4d2d-ae23-c7947e68859b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breads, pastries", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, lemon, mascarpone, raspberries, vanilla, yeast, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 127}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons instant yeast", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "Nonstick spray, as needed", "2 1/2 ounces/70 grams mascarpone cheese (about 1/3 cup)", "2 ounces/55 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/90 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 large egg white", "1/4 cup/70 grams lemon curd", "Zest of 1 lemon (about 1 tablespoon), optional", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "6 ounces/170 grams fresh raspberries", "1 egg", "1 cup/125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Whole milk, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a small saucepan over low, heat milk until just warm to the touch (about 95 degrees).
