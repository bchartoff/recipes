The hotel has been serving blueberry muffins since it opened in 1927, but in 1971, then pastry chef Charles Bonino set out to develop a better recipe. One of the city's best-known department stores, Gilchrist's \u2013 long since closed \u2013 was renowned for its version, so Mr. Bonino bought dozens of the muffins over the years and would analyze and and try to replicate them. He was never totally happy with the results, even if the guests were. Gunther Moesinger, the pastry chef who succeeded Mr. Bonino in 1982, again made more changes, swapping out shortening for butter, increasing the eggs and blueberries and reducing the baking powder. This recipe is an adaptation of Mr. Moesinger's recipe which results in a plump, crusty-topped muffin. They're best eaten the day they are made.\n\n(After this article ran, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/13/style/de-gustibus-the-battle-over-blueberry-muffins.html\">a reader wrote in</a> to argue that the department store Jordan Marsh's blueberry muffins were the best in Boston, not these.
