{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Japanese Chicken and Root Vegetable Stew", "description": "This vegetable-rich stew is based on a Japanese nimono, a simmered dish flavored with kombu, soy sauce and dried shiitake mushroom caps. Although the ingredients may take some searching (check Japanese or Asian markets, or online), the cooking\u00a0 itself is no harder than the usual chicken soup, and the results are just as comforting. You can substitute other root vegetables for the ones called for here. Just make sure to add the sturdier chunks first (taro, celery root, burdock, kohlrabi, turnip, beets) so they have enough time to cook before adding the quicker-cooking ones (turnips, sweet potatoes, winter squash). If you want to make this vegetarian, you can leave out the chicken. It works equally well. Adding cubes of tofu or pieces of fish or seafood during the last few minutes of cooking is also a nice way to go.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/21/multimedia/clark-japanese-stew/clark-japanese-stew-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "carrot, chicken, daikon, kombu, sake, sansho pepper, sweet potato, taro root, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 138}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 322, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "722 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 to 12 dried Japanese or Chinese shiitake mushrooms (about 1 1/2 ounces)", "1 piece kombu, about 7 by 3 1/2 inches", "1 pound bone-in chicken thighs (2 to 3), skins removed if you prefer (or substitute bone-in breast meat)", "4 ounces taro root, celery root or potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces", "4 ounces daikon or other radishes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (or use kohlrabi)", "4 ounces carrots, yellow beets or lotus root, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 cup sake", "2 1/2 tablespoons Japanese soy sauce or tamari, more to taste", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 ounces sweet potato, white turnip or winter squash, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces", "Rice wine vinegar, to taste", "Ground sansho pepper, shichimi togarashi or good smoky chile powder, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, soak dried mushrooms in water overnight at room temperature.
