{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hamburgers (Tavern Style)", "description": "Here is the hamburger you get in better taverns and bars, plump and juicy, with a thick char that gives way to tender, medium-rare meat. It is best cooked in a heavy, cast-iron skillet slicked with oil or fat. Ask a butcher for coarse-ground chuck steak, with at least a 20 percent fat content, or grind your own. Keep it in the refrigerator until you are ready to cook, and then when you do, form your patties gently. Season after the meat is in the pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/14/multimedia/sifton-hamburgers/sifton-hamburgers-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "burgers", "keywords": "ground beef, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 554}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon neutral oil, like canola, or a pat of unsalted butter", "2 pounds ground chuck, at least 20 percent fat", "Kosher salt and black pepper to taste", "4 slices cheese (optional)", "4 soft hamburger buns", "Lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes and condiments, as desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add oil or butter to a large cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet and place over medium heat.
