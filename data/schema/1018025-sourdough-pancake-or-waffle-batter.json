Many recipes call for doing so after discarding a cup or so of the starter you have, so as to maintain its equilibrium and prevent it from growing too large. This recipe takes advantage of that excess starter, using it as the base of a pancake or waffle batter that ferments overnight and yields a remarkably flavorful breakfast the next day, with minimal effort.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/23/dining/23SOURDOUGH4/23SOURDOUGH4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, pancakes", "keywords": "buttermilk, sourdough starter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 857}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 447, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "897 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 grams <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013152-sourdough-starter\">sourdough starter</a> \u201cunfed\u201d", "1 cup/224 grams buttermilk", "1 cup/120 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon/about 13 grams light brown sugar", "1 large egg", "1/4 cup melted unsalted butter or neutral oil", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams kosher salt", "1 teaspoon/6 grams baking soda"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the sourdough starter in a large bowl and add the buttermilk, flour and sugar, then stir to combine.
