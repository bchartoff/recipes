Though this recipe includes a lot of fall flavors, it is great for summer cookouts, a change from the usual suspects. The key to success is to be sure the foil packet is tightly sealed so no juices leak out. Be aware that the intense heat of the coals will deeply char some of the food that\u2019s right up against the foil, but to us that\u2019s the best-tasting part.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby And Chris Schlesinger"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/01/dining/01HOBO/01HOBO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "barbecues", "keywords": "apple, sweet potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 290, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "492 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup golden raisins", "3 tablespoons Cognac", "2 sweet potatoes, peeled and quartered lengthwise", "2 Golden Delicious apples, unpeeled, cored and quartered", "1 large red onion, peeled and sliced thin", "1/4 cup finely chopped sage", "4 tablespoons butter", "1 tablespoon orange zest (about 1 orange)", "Salt and pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a fire in the grill.
