{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Ricotta With Spring Vegetables", "description": "Here\u2019s a multipurpose dish that is perfect for spring, but can also highlight other seasons. It comes from Dan Kluger at Loring Place in Greenwich Village. He made it in winter, studded with squash and mushrooms. For spring, he scattered pickled ramps, favas and spring onions on top. But he said that other seasonal vegetables like artichokes, peas, morel mushrooms and asparagus could be used. As summer rolls in, there will be a different cast of characters to consider, like zucchini, cherry tomatoes and peppers. The dish works as a first course for four or a lunch dish for two, and could even replace salad and cheeses at a more elaborate dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/29/dining/23pairrex1/merlin_154665375_e68f94ec-84e3-4cd2-befa-90e6f204c9b2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, mushroom, ricotta, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium-thick asparagus, ends snapped, slant-cut in 1-inch pieces", "1 ounce fresh mushrooms, preferably morels or oyster mushrooms, separated in pieces", "1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "12 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese", "1/2 ounce grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 1/3 cup)", "3 tablespoons shredded mozzarella", "1/2 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves", "1 large egg plus 1 yolk", "Salt and ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons pesto", "4 freshly cooked, canned or frozen baby artichoke hearts, quartered", "2 scallions, trimmed and minced", "1 teaspoon fresh mint leaves, in chiffonade", "4 slices sourdough or multigrain bread", "1 clove garlic"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, add the asparagus and blanch 5 minutes.
