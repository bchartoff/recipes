{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thanksgiving Roasted Root Veggies", "description": "This simple recipe for roasted vegetables came to The Times from Dr. Andrew Weil, the popular alternative health physician. It's ridiculously easy, and so versatile. Choose a single vegetable or a combination of potatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnips, rutabagas, beets or sweet potatoes. Cut, then toss with olive oil and paprika or chili powder. Roast until tender and brown. Twenty minutes before they're done, toss several garlic cloves into the pan. The garlic will infuse the surrounding vegetables with flavor, and you can spread the softened cloves on bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/05/health/05well_roots/05well_roots-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, kosher, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, root vegetables, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 148, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "342 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head garlic, separated into cloves and peeled", "1-2 pounds root vegetables, peeled and cut in 1 inch pieces (potatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnips, rutabagas, beets, sweet potatoes)", "1 medium onion, peeled, in 1/4-inch wedges", "2 Tbl olive oil", "1-2 Tbl smoked Spanish paprika or mild red chile powder", "salt and pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put vegetables (except garlic) in a bowl.
