{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "BLT Pasta", "description": "When another summer tomato sandwich just won\u2019t do, try this BLT pasta instead. This clever twist on the classic sandwich substitutes spicy arugula for lettuce and in-season cherry tomatoes for heirlooms, which cook in bacon fat and produce a silky, smoky sauce. If baby arugula is out of reach, baby spinach, watercress or Swiss chard would work well in its place. Serve with a raw, shaved zucchini salad tossed with lemon juice, olive oil and mint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/17/dining/colu-henry-blt-pasta-horizontal/merlin_142422969_b2e26882-221d-44ee-8fd9-efe4ad1d33be-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "arugula, bacon, cherry tomatoes, pasta, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 613}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 502, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "522 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound paccheri pasta or other tubelike shape, such as penne or rigatoni", "8 ounces bacon, diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 pound cherry tomatoes, halved", "Kosher salt and\u00a0black pepper", "5 ounces baby arugula", "1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano, plus more for serving", "Flaky salt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil.
