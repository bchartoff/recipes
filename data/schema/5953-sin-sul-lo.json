{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sin-Sul-Lo", "description": "Sin-sul-lo is a Korean soup of many ingredients, served in a round, cylindrical bowl surrounding a funnel that serves as a chimney. It may be one large pot to serve many or individual pots at each place to serve one guest. The ingredients that go into the kettle of broth can vary, but they often include small beef patties, small meat-filled dumplings, bits of sauteed fish cut into small rectangles, cooked baby shrimp, dried black mushrooms and assorted vegetables - even nuts such as ginkgo and walnut meats. The components of the dish may be made a few hours in advance and left to stand at room temperature until you are ready to assemble and serve the foods.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Craig Claiborne"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beef, fish, mushroom, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["5 large dried black Chinese mushrooms", "1/4 pound white fish fillets such as striped bass or flounder", "Salt to taste if desired", "1/2 cup flour", "3 eggs lightly beaten", "Peanut, vegetable or corn oil", "16 to 20 beef patties for sin-sul-lo (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5955-beef-patties-for-sin-sul-lo\">see recipe</a>)", "16 long, unblemished scallions", "1 large carrot, about 1/4 pound, trimmed and scraped", "20 ginkgo nuts, optional", "12 shelled walnut halves, optional", "4 cups rich beef broth made from any standard recipe", "16 baby shrimp, cooked, peeled and deveined", "24 beef dumplings (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5954-beef-dumplings\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the mushrooms in a mixing bowl, and add warm water to cover.
