{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Toasted-Almond Poundcake With Strawberry-Rhubarb Compote", "description": "Poundcake is like brownies: a baker's challenge that sounds like child's play. The name itself is traditionally half the recipe \u2013 a pound each of butter, eggs, sugar and flour \u2013 but the technique is critical to producing a cake that is so tender it can stand alone but is still sturdy enough to hold up under a fruit compote, ice cream or sauce. This recipe, adapted from Joseph Murphy, a pastry chef at Gotham Bar and Grill, calls for melting the butter first, beating the eggs and sugar together until they are very thick, then whisking in the flours and the butter. Although the proportions are the same as for any other poundcake, the result is almost spongy, with a fine crumb.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/24/dining/24COOKING-TOASTED-POUNDCAKE-STRAW-RHUBARB2/24COOKING-TOASTED-POUNDCAKE-STRAW-RHUBARB2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "almond flour, rhubarb, strawberry, dessert, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 676, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "198 milligrams", "sugarContent": "51 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup (2 sticks) plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "5 large eggs", "1 3/4 cups sugar, plus more to taste", "1 1/3 cups almond flour", "1 1/4 cups cake flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon grated tangerine zest", "2 tablespoons sliced almonds", "2 pounds strawberries, hulled", "4 cups trimmed, sliced rhubarb"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
