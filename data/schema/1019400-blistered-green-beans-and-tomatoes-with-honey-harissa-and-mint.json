{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blistered Green Beans and Tomatoes With Honey, Harissa and Mint", "description": "It\u2019s worth seeking out a well-seasoned cast-iron pan for this recipe as the heat will evenly distribute throughout the surface area helping to ensure beautifully charred, but tender vegetables. Smoky, earthy harissa is given a lift with the addition of honey and lime juice, which is tossed with the green beans and tomatoes and some butter to melt at the end of cooking. Serve with grilled sausages for a fast and flavorful summer meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/colu-green-beans-horizontal/colu-green-beans-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "green beans, harissa, mint, main course, side dish, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 314}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 180, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "502 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons harissa", "2 teaspoons honey", "1 tablespoon lime juice (about 1/2 lime)", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 pound green beans, trimmed", "10 ounces grape or cherry tomatoes", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped mint", "Flaky salt for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, combine harissa, honey and lime juice.
