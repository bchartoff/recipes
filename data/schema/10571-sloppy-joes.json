The sloppy Joe sandwich is one such time machine. \n\nThis version is an adaptation of one developed by Chris Gesualdi, the chef at TriBakery in Manhattan. It's a tribute to the one his mother, Rose, used to make for him as a child, and it is perfect: a sweet and spicy hill of thick saut\u00e9ed ground beef spilling out of a toasted homemade kaiser roll. He tops his with melted cheddar, and that can't be a bad thing. All in all, it is a terrific antidote to adulthood.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Andrea Strong"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/03/dining/sloppy-joe/sloppy-joe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, sandwiches", "keywords": "chipotles in adobo, ground beef, tabasco sauce, tomato paste, tomato puree, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 586}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 371, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "547 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 cup finely diced onion", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "2 pounds lean ground beef", "1 cup tomato paste", "2 3/4 cups tomato puree", "1/2 teaspoon chili powder", "1/2 teaspoon Tabasco sauce", "1 teaspoon pureed canned chipotle in adobo", "1 bay leaf", "12 kaiser rolls or hamburger buns", "12 slices cheddar cheese (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil, and saute onions until translucent, 5 to 6 minutes.
