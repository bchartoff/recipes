{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso-Broiled Scallops", "description": "Miso, the traditional Japanese soybean paste, is one of those convenience foods whose complexity belies its ingredients: it contains only soybeans, salt and grain (usually rice or barley, though others are used too), inoculated with the Aspergillus orzyae bacteria and aged for up to three years. The production process is not unlike that for good hard cheese, and miso is frequently compared with Parmesan. It is equally complex, and both are known for the strong presence of umami, the Japanese word for the fifth taste (after salt, sour, sweet and bitter), roughly translated as ''deliciousness.'' Here, miso is combined with little more than scallops, then allowed to sit for a while before grilling or broiling. The combination and preparation are traditional, the equivalent of slathering something with barbecue sauce before cooking. Of course, miso is a far cry from barbecue sauce: its elegance is unmistakable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/29/dining/29COOKING-MISOSCALLOP2/29COOKING-MISOSCALLOP1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "main course, miso, scallops", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 418}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 205, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1950 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup white miso", "2 tablespoons mirin, fruity white wine or dry white wine", "1/2 cup minced onion", "Salt and cayenne pepper", "1 1/2 pounds scallops", "Juice of one lime"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put miso in a bowl.
