{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Turkey and Brussels Sprouts", "description": "A stir-fry is always a great way to use a little bit of leftover meat with a lot of vegetables. This one is quickly accomplished because the turkey is already cooked and it\u2019s thrown into the colorful, gingery mix at the last minute. Once you add the turkey it\u2019s important to stir-fry only long enough to heat the turkey through or it will be dry and stringy. If you are making this just after Thanksgiving and you happen to have leftover Brussels sprouts too, then you can reduce the cooking time even more, adding them along with the turkey after you\u2019ve stir-fried the red peppers, and just stir-frying to heat through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/26/dining/26MARTHA3/26MARTHA3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, red bell pepper, turkey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 149}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 215, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "690 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry", "1/4 cup chicken, turkey or vegetable stock", "1 tablespoon soy sauce, more to taste", "2 tablespoons grapeseed, canola or peanut oil", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "2 fat garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1 1/2 pounds brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered", "1 bunch scallions, cut diagonally in 1/2-inch lengths, dark green parts separated", "1 red bell pepper, cut in thin 2-inch strips", "1 cup shredded turkey", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "Grains or noodles, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine rice wine or sherry, stock and soy sauce in a small bowl.
