{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Aloo Masala (Spiced Potatoes)", "description": "A little bowl of simply spiced half-mashed potatoes and onion, glistening with fat, is a standard side dish at bustling restaurants that serve <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020908\">dosas</a>. It\u2019s also one of the best vegetable dishes \u2014 inexpensive, quick and delicious \u2014 to add to your repertoire as a home cook. The key to these potatoes is water, not fat. Overcooking them just slightly ensures that they\u2019re tender, and that they hold enough moisture so when you drop them into the hot pan, they break up and meld into the saut\u00e9ed onion mix, becoming almost indistinguishable from it. Though aloo masala is great with a hot dosa, it\u2019s a versatile dish that can also work as a side with other meals.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/tr-aloo-masala/merlin_169211607_6cefcc4e-9792-493e-aa27-f00f217a9621-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, vegetables", "keywords": "cilantro, cumin, ginger, lemon, potato, turmeric, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 284}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes (about 4 cups)", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1 tablespoon urad dal (split black gram)", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1/4 teaspoon black mustard seeds", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped roasted cashews", "1 green finger chile (or serrano chile), finely chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "1 medium yellow onion, chopped", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1/2 lemon, for squeezing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a pot of water to boil over high.
