{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro and Green Bean Salad With Walnuts and Dill", "description": "Farro is a perfect vehicle to showcase summer produce. With its nutty flavor and toothsome texture, the whole grain is a great counterbalance to snappy, sweet green beans. The farro cooks while you prepare the rest of the salad, allowing for an easy-to-assemble meal. Dill and walnuts, a nod to Middle Eastern flavors, are used in the gremolata, but pistachios and mint or hazelnuts and parsley would also work. Feta cheese or ricotta salata tossed in at the end would also be a nice addition. This hearty salad works well on its own, but would also be a fine companion to grilled fish or any other protein. Add the acid just before serving; it makes every ingredient sing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/06/dining/ch-farro-and-green-bean-salad/ch-farro-and-green-bean-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, grains and rice, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "dill, farro, green beans, lemon, shallot, walnut, main course, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 287}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup farro", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts", "1 cup roughly chopped fresh dill", "2 tablespoons lemon zest (from about 2 lemons)", "2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot (from about 1 shallot)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 pound green beans, trimmed", "Black pepper", "Lemon juice or white wine vinegar", "Flaky sea salt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add farro, 3 cups water and a pinch of kosher salt to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.
