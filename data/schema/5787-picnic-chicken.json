Rub chickens with a lemon quarter. Season the cavities with salt and pepper to taste. Fill the chickens with the lemons and garlic, then truss them.

They should be well browned; the high heat crisps the skin and renders a great deal of fat. Remove from oven, transfer to a platter and let cool completely (once covered, there should be little condensation or the skin will get flabby). Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Remove meat from bone, and cut into small pieces before packing."}]}
