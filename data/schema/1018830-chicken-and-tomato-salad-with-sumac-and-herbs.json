{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Tomato Salad With Sumac and Herbs", "description": "Layered flavors are the secret behind this chicken salad, from the chef Sara Kramer of Kismet in Los Angeles. After grilling the chicken and letting it rest, reserve the chicken juice to whisk into a vinaigrette of olive oil and lemon juice. Then add chile crisp, that chile-flake-in-oil condiment some Chinese restaurants have on the table, and augment it with toasted and crushed coriander, fennel seed and cardamom. Kismet makes its own shallot powder with dehydrated shallots, but you could use onion powder instead, or fry up some shallots, garlic or onion, mince them with a chef's knife, and add them to the dressing. Finally, the vinaigrette gets a generous spoonful of sumac for an elegantly tart note. You should use the best-looking herbs and greens at your local greenmarket. If there are several kinds of basil or mint, grab them. This recipe is less a precise formulation than a structure for a dish that you will make your own. If you're tight on time, grill the chicken ahead, even the day before (and, if you can\u2019t grill, poach the chicken in chicken stock with aromatic herbs). When it\u2019s time, assemble the ingredients and serve with grilled bread or a bowl of rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Oliver Strand"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/12/dining/12CHEF2/12CHEF2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "arugula, basil, chicken, chile crisp, cilantro, mint, sumac, main course, side dish, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 64}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 638, "unsaturatedFatContent": "34 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1039 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (4-pound) whole chicken, spatchcocked, or cut into 8 pieces", "Olive oil", "Salt and pepper", "1 white onion", "1 small bunch mint, leaves only", "1 small bunch cilantro, leaves only", "1 small bunch basil, leaves only", "1 small bunch arugula (about a cup), or other flavorful leafy greens, woody stems trimmed", "2 to 3 large ripe tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces", "3/4 teaspoon coriander seeds", "3/4 teaspoon fennel seeds", "Juice and zest of 2 lemons, plus more to taste", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon spicy chile crisp, or other chile oil (see note)", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/2 teaspoon shallot or onion powder", "1 tablespoon sumac, plus more to taste", "Salt and black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly rub the chicken with olive oil, and season with salt and fresh-ground pepper.
