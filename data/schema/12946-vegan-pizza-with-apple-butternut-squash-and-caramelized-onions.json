The creamy white bean pur\u00e9e made by whizzing cannellini beans, oil, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, salt and pepper in a food processor makes this dish seem like a real treat, and the piles of caramelized onions, roasted butternut squash, apple and spinach finish it off beautifully. If you're a half-hearted vegan, consider sprinkling a handful of blue cheese over the top a few minutes before it's done baking.
