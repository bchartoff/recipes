If you\u2019ve made fresh tomato sauce over the summer or you\u2019re still getting wonderful tomatoes at the farmers\u2019 market, use fresh tomato sauce; otherwise, use canned tomatoes for your marinara sauce. You can substitute cooked grains for the Israeli couscous; if you don\u2019t tolerate gluten, try the recipe using cooked brown rice instead.
