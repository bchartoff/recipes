It is incredibly simple \u2013 if you can chop vegetables, boil water and whisk eggs, you can make this dish \u2013 but it's also indubitably luxurious. Everyone will think you slaved for hours when, really, you slaved for about 20 minutes. Timing is everything in this recipe, so be sure to bring your eggs to room temperature before you start, and have all of the ingredients ready before you toss the pasta in the water.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/21/dining/21COOKING_SPAGHETTICARB2/21COOKING_SPAGHETTICARB2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1788}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 430, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "447 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 slices bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces", "1/2 pound English peas, shelled (about 1 cup), or 1/2 cup frozen peas", "1 pound spaghetti", "4 ounces asparagus, sliced diagonally 1/8-inch thick (1 cup)", "10 fresh basil leaves, sliced thin", "5 eggs, whisked, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons whole milk", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for garnish (2 ounces)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat and add the bacon, cooking for about 5 minutes, until crispy.
