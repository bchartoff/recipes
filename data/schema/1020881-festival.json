Using a wire spider or slotted spoon, remove festival from oil and transfer to paper towel-lined baking sheet. Cut into one to ensure the inside is cooked all the way through; it should not look wet. If it is not fully cooked, cook each fritter 30 seconds to 1 minute longer. Transfer to oven to keep warm. Fry remaining festival. Serve hot."}]}
