Either start cooking when your main grilled item comes off the fire or, if making this sauce separately, light a charcoal fire in your grill, putting all the coals on one side, and wait until it has died down to medium. Remove some or all of the pith and seeds from the jalape\u00f1os if you prefer a milder sauce. This relish is particularly good with beef.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby and Chris Schlesinger"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/dining/25PANTRY3/25PANTRY3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "south american", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "fall, summer, garlic, jalape\u00f1o, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 294, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "198 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 to 6 lemons, halved crosswise", "1 red or green jalape\u00f1o, stemmed and halved lengthwise", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 1/2 cups roughly chopped parsley", "1/4 cup minced garlic (roughly 8 large cloves)", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon cumin seed", "Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Coat lemons and jalape\u00f1o lightly with oil and place on grill over medium heat, cut side down.
