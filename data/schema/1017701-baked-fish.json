{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Fish", "description": "Cooking fish for 10 minutes per inch of thickness is an old rule of thumb that works perfectly when roasting fillets or steaks. It\u2019s just enough time to cook the flesh through so that it\u2019s opaque, but not so much that it flakes. The only hitch comes with fillets that are uneven. Use your judgment but err on the side of less is more. You can always put any undercooked parts back in the oven, but you can\u2019t undo overdone. Serve these as is in their purist form, or add your favorite sauce on the side. A pesto, aioli or vinaigrette would work well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/05/dining/mc-broiled-fish/merlin_150935046_c47e8102-4f53-4e8e-8e50-6363cb185f6d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "fish, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 935}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 126, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "274 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 fish fillets or steaks of any kind of fish, skin on or off to taste", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Fine sea salt", "Black pepper", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
