{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Country Captain", "description": "Country Captain is a dish you\u2019ll find throughout the Lowcountry of South Carolina and Georgia, in restaurants and home dining rooms alike. It has been a staple of Southeastern Junior League cookbooks since at least the 1950s and is found in various forms in older cookbooks as far back as the 18th century. It is, simply, chicken fried in butter or bacon fat, then stewed in the oven with tomatoes fragrant with curry and pepper and served over white Carolina rice. Made correctly, it captures exactly that moment of excitement you can feel when first arriving in the region from far away: a sense that everything really is different in the South, that it is the one last, true regional culture in the United States.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/24/dining/sifton-country-captain-horizontal/sifton-country-captain-horizontal-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "bacon, chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 545}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1072, "unsaturatedFatContent": "47 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "78 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "65 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "1579 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup flour", "Kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon dried thyme", "2 tablespoons butter", "3 pounds (about 8) chicken thighs", "4 slices bacon", "1 medium yellow onion, diced", "1 medium green pepper, seeded and diced", "2 ribs celery, diced", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "2 tablespoons curry powder", "3 tablespoons currants", "1 28-ounce can chopped tomatoes and their juices", "3 tablespoons slivered almonds, toasted", "Cooked white rice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the flour, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper and the thyme in a bowl.
