{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Aioli With Roasted Vegetables", "description": "In Provence, the garlic-infused mayonnaise called aioli is typically served with a platter of raw and boiled vegetables and sometimes fish. With its intense creamy texture and deep garlic flavor, it turns a humble meal into a spectacular one. In this recipe, an assortment of colorful roasted vegetables stand in for the raw and boiled ones. It makes a very elegant side dish to an entr\u00e9e of roasted fish or meat, or can be the main event of a vegetable-focused meal. The aioli can be made up to three days ahead and stored in the refrigerator. The vegetables are best roasted right before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/21/multimedia/clark-veg-aioli/clark-veg-aioli-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french, provencal", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, finger foods, vegetables", "keywords": "aioli, beets, broccoli florets, cauliflower, squash, turnip, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 621}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 226, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "520 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small head broccoli, cut into florets and the stem cut into bite-size pieces", "1 small head cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets", "3 medium beets, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch wedges", "3 medium turnips, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch wedges", "1 acorn squash, halved, seeded and cut into 1-inch wedges", "2 bunches scallions, trimmed and halved lengthwise", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "Pomegranate seeds, for serving (optional)", "1 to 3 garlic cloves, grated or mashed to a paste", "1 teaspoon lemon juice, more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste", "1 large egg", "1 large egg yolk", "3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the vegetables:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
