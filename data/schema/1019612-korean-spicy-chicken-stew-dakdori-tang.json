{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Korean Spicy Chicken Stew (Dakdori Tang)", "description": "This recipe, from the Brooklyn chef Sohui Kim, is an ideal one-pot weeknight meal, as everything \u2014 chicken included \u2014 is thrown into the pot. Soy sauce, fiery gochugaru (Korean dried red-pepper flakes), fish sauce and radish kimchi give this stew a deeply funky, satisfying flavor. During the summer, Ms. Kim grills a few of the chicken pieces (see note) and tosses them into the sauce to braise with the sauce. The kimchi called for here is not cabbage kimchi, it is kkakdugi, sometimes listed as cubed radish kimchi or cubed moo radish kimchi, available at Korean grocery stores.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/dining/kim-chicken-stew-horizontal/kim-chicken-stew-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken, cubed moo radish kimchi, gochugaru, gochujang, potatoes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 234}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 447, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1432 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup soy sauce", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "8 cloves garlic, minced", "1/4 cup gochujang", "3 tablespoons coarse gochugaru", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces", "2 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, diced (4 cups), or 12 whole baby potatoes", "1 cup cubed moo radish kimchi", "2 Korean green chiles or 3 Serrano chiles, sliced 1/4 inch thick", "1 bunch scallions, white parts only, cut into 2-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make a seasoning paste by mixing the soy sauce, ginger, garlic, gochujang, gochugaru, fish sauce and sugar in a small bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large sauce pot, combine the chicken with the seasoning paste and 3 cups water.
