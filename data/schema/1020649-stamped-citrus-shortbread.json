{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stamped Citrus Shortbread", "description": "Use cast-iron cookie stamps to leave imprints on this beautifully textured shortbread, which is flavored with tangy orange and lemon zests. The stamps, which are available online, are a fun way to shape and decorate cookies without much effort. (Don\u2019t be afraid to be generous with the flour, on the cookie balls and on the stamps themselves, shaking off excess so you still get a clean imprint.) But if you don\u2019t have stamps, you can roll and cut the dough using a simply shaped cutter, or roll the dough into a log for slice-and-bake cookies.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/ss-citrus-shortbread/merlin_163736658_f0f3dcf3-5a89-4439-9ba7-5f788ed22be1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "butter, confectioners' sugar, flour, lemon, orange, vanilla, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 403}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup/45 grams cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), softened", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 orange (preferably tangelo)", "1 lemon", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon lemon extract", "3/4 cup/75 grams sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 tablespoon melted butter", "1 tablespoon fresh orange juice, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cookies: Add flour, cornstarch and salt to a medium bowl, and whisk to combine.

One at a time, dip a ball of dough into flour and set on work surface. If dough balls soften too much, return them to the refrigerator to firm up for a few minutes. You want it cool, but malleable. Dip cookie stamp in flour, and press down on the ball of dough until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Remove stamp. (If dough sticks to stamp, carefully peel it off.
