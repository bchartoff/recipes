{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlic Broth With Basmati Rice, Turkey and Squash", "description": "This is the kind of soup you can whip up on a whim if you have garlic on hand and either summer or winter squash. You can make a vegetarian version of the soup just by eliminating the turkey. Otherwise it is one more healthy option for your Thanksgiving leftovers. When I made the soup the first time I used a lingering half-zucchini that I found in my sister\u2019s refrigerator. At this time of year you might be more likely to have winter squash on hand. Either will work. Winter squash will take 10 to 15 minutes longer to cook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/25/science/27recipehealth/27recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Yield: Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "french, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 5, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "54 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups water", "10 garlic cloves, crushed, peels removed", "Salt to taste", "1 bay leaf", "2 sprigs thyme or 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/3 cup basmati rice, rinsed", "1 cup sliced or diced winter squash or zucchini", "2/3 cup shredded turkey", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil (optional)", "Freshly ground pepper (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine water, garlic, salt, bay leaf and thyme in a soup pot or saucepan and bring to a boil.
