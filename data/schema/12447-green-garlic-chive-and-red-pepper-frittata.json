{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Garlic, Chive and Red Pepper Frittata", "description": "Green garlic has a small window. At the beginning of the season the bulbs look more like leeks or spring onions than garlic, as they have not yet set cloves. To prepare them just cut away the stalks as you would a spring onion, cut them in half and remove any tough stalk that might be running down the middle, remove the papery outer layers and chop like a scallion or leek. Some farmers sell garlic scapes, the curly, green flowering end of the garlic plant. If you can\u2019t find them at a farmers market, you can find recipes at several Web sites. They can be used in the same way you might use the green parts of scallions.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/05/14/health/nutrition/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "eggs, green garlic, ricotta, gluten-free, healthy, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "314 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 large red bell pepper, seeded and cut in small dice", "2 bulbs green garlic, trimmed of stalks and papery layers, sliced", "Salt ", "6 eggs", "1 cup whole-milk ricotta", "1/4 cup minced or snipped chives", "Freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat in a heavy 10-inch nonstick skillet and add the bell pepper.
