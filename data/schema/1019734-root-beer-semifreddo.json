Root beer can also be used as the basis for a barbecue marinade, best made by first reducing and concentrating the drink. I took bits of some of these applications to make a frozen dessert, a semifreddo that\u2019s got root beer every which way. The root beer is reduced and infused with spices, then used to make a custard and mixed with whipped cream and egg whites. There is also some birch or maple syrup to enhance the texture as well as the flavor, and rum to spike the sauce of apricots poached in \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 root beer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apricots, birch syrup, dark rum, juniper berries, root beer, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 231, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "53 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 12-ounce bottles root beer, preferably made with cane sugar", "1 teaspoon whole allspice", "1 teaspoon juniper berries", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3 large eggs, separated", "4 tablespoons birch syrup or maple syrup, preferably grade B", "1 1/3 cups heavy cream", "1/4 cup dark rum", "4 firm but ripe apricots, pitted and cut in eighths"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a 6-cup metal loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving generous overhang on the sides.
