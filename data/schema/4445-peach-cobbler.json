{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach Cobbler", "description": "Everyone has a different idea about what a cobbler should be. Biscuit-topped? Double-crusted? Cakelike? We\u2019re not here to cast a vote, merely to present a simple Southern cake-style cobbler that makes the most of ripe summer peaches (or the frozen ones languishing in the back of your freezer). All you really need is a bowl, a saucepan, a baking pan and a spoon. When you transfer the batter to the pan, it will not completely cover the bottom, nor will it cover the top of the peaches, but cobble it together the best you can. As it bakes, the batter will rise up along the sides of the pan and through the peaches, developing a crisp exterior and tender interior.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alex Ward"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/27/dining/aw-peach-cobbler/merlin_156816861_1d07d8d3-a56e-4b20-adfc-9b6aca047120-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "weekday, cakes, pies and tarts", "keywords": "butter, flour, peach, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 855}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 343, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "175 milligrams", "sugarContent": "41 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds ripe peaches or 6 cups frozen sliced peaches", "12 tablespoons butter (1 1/2 sticks)", "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (See Tip)", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup milk", "Vanilla ice cream, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
