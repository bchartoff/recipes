No lemon or vinegar, no mustard, no pepper. Quarts of aioli are produced daily, mounted by hand with a wire whisk.\u00a0You can, of course, make aioli with an electric blender or food processor in a matter of seconds, but,\u00a0in \u201cThe Zuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook,\u201d\u00a0the chef Judy Rodgers describes how to make aioli with a mortar and pestle, the old-fashioned way. It takes patience, but the result is sublime. Choose a mild-tasting extra-virgin olive oil, perhaps a French one, or use a mixture of half-olive oil and half-neutral-tasting vegetable oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/06/dining/06kitchrex3-1/06kitchrex3-1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 1/2 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, condiments, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "egg yolks, garlic, olive oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 83}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 250, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "72 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large or 2 small garlic cloves", "Salt", "1 egg yolk", "1/2 cup mild-tasting extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut garlic into a few pieces, and pound them in a mortar.\u00a0Add a pinch of salt, which will act as an abrasive and help you\u00a0smash the last solid bits of garlic."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the egg yolk and stir with the pestle\u00a0to combine the mixture.
