For this recipe, I\u2019ve swapped the broccoli rabe for a rich fennel component, which adds a distinctive flavor profile to the pasta dish. The preparation goes fairly quickly. And as an alternative to tossing the ingredients together before serving, it can be placed in an ovenproof casserole and baked, shingled generously with shards of pecorino on top. Baking at 350 degrees will take about 20 minutes, if the ingredients are hot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/27Pairrex/merlin_169350585_b61dae9f-c1cc-4c88-abac-e852b589942f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "fennel, mascarpone, orecchiette, sausage, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 35}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound sweet Italian sausage with fennel", "1 teaspoon fennel seeds", "1 large fennel bulb, trimmed, cored and chopped (about 2 cups), fronds reserved", "1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 cup)", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "Salt", "12 ounces orecchiette", "1/4 cup mascarpone", "Ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1 ounce pecorino, grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a 3-quart saut\u00e9 pan on medium-low.
