{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Cake Soup With Bok Choy and Edamame", "description": "This fresh soup is a riff on something that a Chinese or Korean mom might make, with rice cakes added to bulk it up. You can find the white, oval disks in most Asian supermarkets; they are made with glutinous rice flour and have a chewy texture. They are precooked, but will rehydrate and soak up more liquid in this soup. If you find that they have soaked up too much, simply add a little more broth or water to thin out the soup. Substituting one to two cups of cooked rice to the soup in place of the rice cakes works well if you don't have access to an Asian grocery store.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/06/dining/sl-rice-cake-soup/sl-rice-cake-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, noodles, soups and stews, vegetables", "keywords": "bok choy, ginger, leek, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 54}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup vegetable oil", "2 medium leeks, trimmed, white and light green parts cut into 1/4-inch rounds", "1 bunch scallions (about 6), whites and greens separated, thinly sliced", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 cups chicken stock", "2 medium heads baby bok choy (about 8 ounces), trimmed, stems and leaves divided, stems cut into bite-size pieces", "2 cups fresh or frozen rice cakes (about 10 ounces)", "1 cup frozen shelled edamame", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a pot, heat oil over medium-high.
