I didn\u2019t have some of the traditional ingredients for pho \u2013 bean sprouts, cilantro, scallions, green chiles \u2013 so I used what I had and it was definitely pho. I used cayenne for heat and a chiffonade of romaine lettuce was a good stand-in for the bean sprouts, crunchy and fresh. Lots of chives stood in for scallions. I did without cilantro or Thai basil but had plenty of Italian basil and mint from my garden.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/01/science/02recipehealth/02recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "asian vegetables, rice noodles, vegan pho broth, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low-sodium, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 146}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 286, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "186 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 recipe <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12400-simple-vegetarian-pho-broth\">ph\u00f4 broth</a> (about 2 1/2 quarts)", "3/4 pound rice noodles, preferably wide ones", "2 medium or 1 large carrot (about 5 ounces) peeled and cut in 1 1/2-inch julienne", "2 cups edamame (can use frozen, thawed)", "6 ounces tofu, cut in matchsticks", "1/2 cup Asian or purple basil leaves, or Italian basil, slivered", "4 scallions, chopped, or 1/4 cup chopped chives", "1 cup chopped cilantro (optional)", "Several sprigs fresh mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Have the broth at a simmer in a soup pot.
