In this recipe, he weighs the eggplant slices down while they roast (like chicken under a brick), which presses out extra liquid and forms a magnificent crust. Finished with a rich, spicy ginger-peanut sauce and sparked with cool, crunchy fresh herbs, it's equally satisfying room temperature as a salad or warm as a vegetarian entr\u00e9e, served with rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/dining/peternell-roasted-eggplant-horizontal/merlin_144070413_29a29034-4ef3-4899-8996-42496badbadd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, eggplant, ginger, peanut, sambal oelek, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 315}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 232, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "440 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 eggplants, about 1 pound each", "Kosher or sea salt", "1/4 to 1/2 cup roasted peanuts, crushed or chopped, more as desired", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 medium garlic clove, pounded to a paste or finely chopped", "2 to 3 tablespoons sambal oelek, Sriracha or other red chile paste, more to taste", "7 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil, more as needed", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, cut into fine julienne", "2 large or 3 small scallions, white and light green parts only, chopped or thinly sliced lengthwise into fine julienne", "1/2 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare two heavy skillets: One large skillet and one medium skillet that fits inside the large one.
