{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Pumpkin Seeds", "description": "The not-so-secret secret to roasting fresh pumpkin seeds \u2014 and crisping them properly \u2014 is making sure they\u2019re really dry. Patting the seeds down with paper towels does a fine job, but drying them out in the oven is even more efficient and effective. Once they\u2019ve toasted slightly, simply dress them with oil and salt, then continue to roast them until lightly golden. Feel free to add spices \u2014 say za\u2019atar, or cinnamon and cayenne \u2014 in Step 3 with the oil and salt. But take note: Some add-ins, like nutritional yeast or raw sugar, may melt under high heat, so sprinkle them onto the seeds just after roasting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/dining/as-roasted-pumpkin-seeds/merlin_162801129_2c290fcc-b008-40db-8077-dfc93834a19f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, fall, oil, pumpkin seeds, salt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 66}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup fresh pumpkin seeds", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To clean the pumpkin seeds of pumpkin slime and flesh, put the seeds in a large bowl filled with cold water.
