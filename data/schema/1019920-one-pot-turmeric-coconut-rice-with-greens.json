{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Turmeric Coconut Rice With Greens", "description": "No matter how you modify this one-pot rice, it can\u2019t help but simultaneously comfort and enliven: The rice is cooked with turmeric, black pepper and rich coconut milk, which is all brightened by a mix of coconut, sesame seeds and lime. The greens, which conveniently cook on top of the rice, can be swapped out for anything that steams in 10 minutes, such as frozen peas or edamame, green beans, broccoli, grated carrots or sliced fennel. While a meal all on its own, this rice would also be great accompanied by tofu, white fish, chicken thighs or stewed black beans. Prepared as written, this dish has a relatively pure, mild flavor, so if you want more oomph, add more turmeric and saffron and season with plenty of salt and pepper as you cook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/dining/as-yellow-coconut-rice/merlin_149991612_12dbd842-8c7e-4719-b321-7105ba358eb5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice", "keywords": "coconut flakes, coconut milk, rice, sesame seeds, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2927}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 369, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "sodiumContent": "866 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups long-grain rice, such as jasmine or basmati", "1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes", "1 tablespoon white or black sesame seeds", "2 tablespoons coconut oil", "1 scallion, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed", "1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "Pinch of saffron (optional)", "Kosher salt", "1 medium bunch kale, spinach or Swiss chard", "1 lime"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse rice until water runs clear.
