{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Easy Chicken With Rice", "description": "You can make a big deal out of chicken with rice -- at its zenith, it becomes paella -- but it is a dish that takes well to short cuts. And even at its simplest, it's a crowd-pleaser.\n\nFor fast weeknight meals, I strip chicken and rice to its essentials: oil, onion, chicken and rice. Stock makes the best cooking liquid, but water works almost as well, because as it simmers with the chicken they combine to produce a flavorful broth. To reduce greasiness, I remove the skin from the chicken before cooking it. (In a moist dish like this one, the skin is not especially appetizing anyway.)\n\nYou can easily vary this dish by using any stock instead of water; by substituting another grain, like pearled barley, for the rice; by saut\u00e9ing or roasting the chicken separately and combining it with the rice at the last minute; by adding sausage or shellfish, like shrimp, along with the chicken, or, most excitingly, by adding strips of red pepper, pitted olives, capers, chopped tomatoes or shelled peas to the initial onion mix.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/12/dining/Chicken-With-Rice-The-Easy-Way/Chicken-With-Rice-The-Easy-Way-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight", "keywords": "chicken, onion, rice, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1116}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 581, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "578 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 medium onions, about 8 ounces, peeled and sliced", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 chicken, cut up into serving pieces", "1 1/2 cups white rice", "Pinch saffron, optional", "Freshly minced parsley or cilantro for garnish", "Lemon or lime wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set 3 cups of water to boil.
