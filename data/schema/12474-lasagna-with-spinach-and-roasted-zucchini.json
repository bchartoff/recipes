{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lasagna With Spinach and Roasted Zucchini", "description": "You may think of lasagna as a rich, heavy dish, but it needn\u2019t be. There\u2019s no need to compensate for the absence of a traditional Bolognese sauce by packing these casseroles with pounds of ricotta and grated cheese. Some of each of those elements is welcome, but I cut the usual amounts by half in this recipe, and it was plenty satisfying. You can get ahead on lasagna by making up big batches of marinara sauce and freezing it, or in a pinch use a good commercial brand. The noodles are no-boil, which really makes these lasagnas easy to assemble. They can be made ahead and reheated, or frozen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/05/30/science/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "healthy, high fiber, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, marinara sauce, no-boil lasagna noodles, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1037}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 372, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "862 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 medium zucchini, cut in half crosswise, then cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 pound bunch spinach, washed and stemmed, or 1/2 pound bagged baby spinach", "3 cups marinara sauce, preferably homemade from fresh or canned tomatoes", "8 ounces ricotta cheese", "1 egg", "2 tablespoons water", "Pinch of cinnamon", "7 to 8 ounces no-boil lasagna", "4 ounces (1 cup) freshly grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
