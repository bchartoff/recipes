{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braai-Spiced T-Bone Steaks", "description": "Grilling meat is practically the South African national sport, crossing lines of wealth, geography and even race. Braai means grill in Afrikaans, and some say it\u2019s the only word recognized in all of the country\u2019s 11 official languages. There\u2019s no reason this braai sout, a fragrant dry rub, can\u2019t be used on steaks other than a T-bone. But the T-bone has had special status there since Archbishop Desmond Tutu, as part of a campaign to bring all South Africans together around the braai, pointed out that the shape of that steak mimics the shape of Africa itself. Serve with whole potatoes roasted in the coals, and drink beer or one of South Africa\u2019s excellent wines.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/dining/25AFRICA-GRILLED-T-BONE-STEAK/25AFRICA-GRILLED-T-BONE-STEAK-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops", "keywords": "fall, summer, main course, t-bone steak", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 181}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 894, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "78 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "sodiumContent": "910 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "3 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons coarse salt", "2 tablespoons white or brown sugar (optional)", "2 tablespoons coriander seeds", "1 tablespoon black peppercorns", "1 tablespoon paprika or 2 teaspoons paprika plus 1 teaspoon cayenne", "1 tablespoon garlic flakes or powder", "1 tablespoon onion powder", "1 tablespoon dried thyme", "4 to 6 T-bone steaks, about 1 1/2 inches thick"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the braai spice: In a grinder or mortar and pestle, grind all the seasonings and herbs until fine."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rub steaks with the braai spice and set aside in refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours.
