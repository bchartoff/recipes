{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lentils With Smoked Trout Rilletes", "description": "A new take on surf and turf, with simply cooked lentils topped with smoked trout. This plate of lentils topped with quenelle-shaped spoonfuls of smoked trout rillettes is not your run of the mill surf and turf combo. It is inspired by a wonderful dish I ate at Buvette, a tiny, lively bistro in Paris. I was there in October, less than a week after I had eaten at its equally popular twin in New York, where the menu was almost identical, except this dish wasn\u2019t offered on the New York menu when I was there (instead I enjoyed brandade). The lentils were simply cooked and came topped with a big scoop of the smoked trout rillettes, a great combo. If I were French I would make the rillettes with lots of butter, but this version has more of a Mediterranean sensibility. Use a fork, not a food processor, to mash the smoked trout, as you want the rillettes to have some texture. Any type of lentil will work here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/09/science/08recipeforhealth/08recipeforhealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, dips and spreads", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, high protein, kosher, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 358, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "912 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups / 14 ounces lentils (green, brown, or black), rinsed and picked over", "1 1/2 quarts water", "1 onion, cut in half", "1 bay leaf", "2 garlic cloves, crushed", "Pinch of cayenne, or 1 dried cayenne pepper (optional)", "Salt", "Freshly ground pepper", "7 to 8 ounces smoked trout fillets, skin and bones removed", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature (may substitute Greek yogurt)", "4 to 6 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt (depending on whether or not you use butter)", "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (to taste)", "1 to 2 tablespoons minced chives (to taste)", "Freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium size pot, combine lentils, water, onion, bay leaf, garlic and optional cayenne.
