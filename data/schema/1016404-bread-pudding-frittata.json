{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bread Pudding Frittata", "description": "At El Rey Coffee Bar and Luncheonette, you can get this rich, silky egg terrine all day long, but it\u2019s particularly wonderful at breakfast or brunch. Although it does take time to put together, you can do all of it well ahead \u2013 up to 24 hours. And the last minute work is minimal (slice an avocado, chop up some fresh herbs). Don\u2019t be tempted to skip the frequent stirring while the dish bakes. It may seem fussy, but in fact is the key to the luscious texture, which is somewhere between custard and bread pudding.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/28/dining/28BRUNCH2/28BRUNCH2-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "avocado, bread, eggs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 21}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 221, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "323 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces soft white bread (Pullman, pain de mie or brioche all work well), cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks (3 1/2 cups)", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "18 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1/3 cup whole milk", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "Sliced avocado, for serving", "Mixed soft herbs, such as parsley, mint or tarragon, coarsely chopped, for serving", "Lemon juice, for serving", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
