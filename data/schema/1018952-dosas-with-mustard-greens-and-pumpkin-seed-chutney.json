You may need to hunt down the ingredients (online or at an Indian market), and you\u2019ll definitely have to soak the lentils and then let the batter ferment for at least 8 hours or overnight. But the crisp and flavorful crepes are well worth the effort. Note that the first dosas you fry might not turn out well\u00a0\u2014 spreading the batter thin enough takes practice. This recipe, adapted from the chef\u00a0Anita Jaisinghani of Pondicheri, calls for filtered water because fluoride can interfere with fermentation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/11/dining/11Appe1/11Appe1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, breads", "keywords": "coconut, coconut water, curry leaves, fenugreek, mustard greens, ragi flour, raw pumpkinseeds, white urad dal, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 36}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 589, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "384 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup white rice (long or short grain)", "1/3 cup white urad dal (see note)", "1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds", "1/3 cup rice flour", "1/3 cup ragi flour or millet flour (see note)", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Coconut oil, as needed for cooking", "1 cup raw pumpkin seeds (pepitas)", "1/2 cup coconut oil", "3/4 teaspoon brown mustard seeds", "2 1/2 tablespoons fresh or frozen curry leaves, chopped", "1 cup finely chopped red onion", "2/3 cup coarsely grated fresh or frozen coconut", "2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1/3 cup coconut water", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/2 tablespoon coconut oil", "1/2 teaspoon whole coriander seeds", "1 small bunch mustard greens, torn into bite-sized pieces (about 6 cups)", "Pinch of fine sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the batter: Rinse the rice and urad dal in cold water, then drain and transfer to a large bowl or container.
