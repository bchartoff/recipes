{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Tikka Masala", "description": "This creamy, spiced curry made with tomato and hunks of chicken is a longtime favorite of Indian food lovers. This version is streamlined a bit, making it not-quite-authentic, but truly accessible to anyone with a well-stocked pantry. It's also adapted for those without a grill, so the yogurt-marinated chicken spends a few minutes under the broiler to replicate the blackened, smoky bits. Finally, chicken breasts or thighs work equally well here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/30/dining/30COOKING-CHICKEN-TIKKA-MASALA/30COOKING-CHICKEN-TIKKA-MASALA-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "curries", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1343}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 641, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1314 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon garam masala", "2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "2 teaspoons hot paprika or 1 teaspoon cayenne", "1\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning", "1 1/2 cups whole-milk yogurt", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice", "6 large cloves garlic, finely grated", "2-inch piece of ginger, finely grated", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, left whole, or breasts, cut in half lengthwise or in thirds if extra large", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee", "1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine garam masala, turmeric, cumin, paprika, 1\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk 1 cup yogurt, lemon juice, 3 cloves of garlic, half the ginger and half the spice mixture together.
