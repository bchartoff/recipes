{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Cheesecake In Nut Crust", "description": "Some cheesecakes are the culinary equivalent of a punch in the gut: too sweet, too heavy, too filling. This one, first published in The Times in 1984, is delightfully different. It's lightly-sweet, slightly tangy and gently laced with spiced pumpkin flavor. The texture is surprisingly airy. Serve slices with a dollop of whipped cream or cr\u00e9me fra\u00eeche.\n\nDon't skip the part of the recipe that calls for allowing it to cool in the oven overnight; it promises a crack-free, glossy top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Marian Burros"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/30/dining/30COOKING-CHEESECAKE3/30COOKING-CHEESECAKE3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H30M", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cream cheese, pecans, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, dessert, fall, winter, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 269}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 531, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "46 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "330 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups ground pecans", "2 tablespoons brown sugar", "1 egg white, beaten until frothy", "1 teaspoon powdered ginger", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon rind", "4 eggs", "3 egg yolks", "2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, softened", "3/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "2 1/2 teaspoons freshly grated lemon rind", "1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch (or use 3 tablespoons flour)", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 pound pumpkin puree, fresh or canned", "Coarsely grated lemon rind for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the crust, mix nuts with sugar, egg white, ginger and rind just until mixture is bound together.
