{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Teff Carrot Cake", "description": "This deeply spiced carrot cake is studded with toasted walnuts and coconut, and sandwiched with a tangy mix of cream cheese and butter. It's also gluten-free, and festive enough to prepare for a special occasion. The cake comes from the San Francisco pastry chef Elisabeth Prueitt, whose interest in baking with alternative flours has led to many exceptional wheat-free creations. Made with teff flour and sweetened with a mix of coconut sugar and granulated sugar, it results in a tender, moist crumb and irresistible texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/09/dining/09TARTINE8/09TARTINE8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "applesauce, carrot, coconut, cream cheese, sweet rice flour, teff flour, walnut, dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 149}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 932, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "104 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "57 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "34 grams", "sodiumContent": "617 milligrams", "sugarContent": "75 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter, for greasing pans", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/140 grams coconut sugar", "3 large eggs", "1/2 cup/125 grams applesauce", "1 pound/455 grams carrots, peeled and grated", "1 cup/236 milliliters coconut oil, warmed to liquid", "Juice of 1 lemon", "1 1/4 cups/170 grams teff flour", "1/2 cup/70 grams sweet rice flour", "1/2 cup/60 grams oat flour", "2 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/45 grams unsweetened shredded coconut", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams toasted walnuts, chopped", "8 ounces/225 grams/1 cup cream cheese, at room temperature", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, at cool room temperature", "3 cups/360 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "Juice of 1 lemon", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
