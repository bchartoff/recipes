In his version, fresh grapefruit are sliced into rounds and very simply dressed with superb olive oil and flaky sea salt. The result is a juicy salad that works particularly well when served with sausages, eggs, and other rich brunch favorites. Or offer it for dinner with grilled or roasted meats. If you can\u2019t get good grapefruit, try it with oranges, tangerines and other citrus.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/28/dining/28BRUNCH4/28BRUNCH4-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, quick", "keywords": "grapefruit, olive oil, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 146}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 100, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "429 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 Ruby Red grapefruit", "Good quality extra-virgin olive oil", "Flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel fruit, pulling and scraping off as much of the white pith as possible.
