{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Muffins With Candied Almonds", "description": "Classic strawberry muffins get a few modern twists in this cheery take. First, egg yolks replace whole eggs, resulting in a richer, more flavorful crumb. The muffins get a double dose of strawberries: diced fresh berries in the batter and an optional dusting of freeze-dried strawberries on top. Finally, a reserved egg white is tossed with sugar and sliced almonds to make a crunchy topping for the muffins. As always, for the best flavor, pick the ripest, brightest strawberries of the bunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/dining/jg-strawberry-muffins/jg-strawberry-muffins-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, breads, cakes, quick breads", "keywords": "almonds, lemon, milk, strawberries, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 129}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups/320 milliliters whole milk", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)", "3 1/2 cups/450 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 eggs, whites and yolks separated", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for the topping", "1 cup/95 grams sliced almonds", "12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), melted and cooled", "2 cups/370 grams fresh strawberries, finely chopped", "1/3 cup/5 grams freeze-dried strawberries (optional)", "1 tablespoon confectioners\u2019 sugar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
