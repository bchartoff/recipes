{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blackberry Corn Cobbler", "description": "This cobbler substitutes fresh, juicy kernels and corn milk for traditional heavy cream, taking advantage of the sweetness of seasonal corn and adding texture to a buttery crust. Grating two large ears of corn should produce enough liquid for the topping, but, if not, you can grate a third ear, or add cream or milk. The rich, crumbly crust also gets some of its moisture from the filling, which is extra syrupy from the mashed blackberries. Serve the cobbler warm with a splash of heavy cream, a dollop of coconut yogurt, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Finishing it all off with a drizzle of dark rum, while not necessary, is especially sweet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/02/dining/jg-blackberry-cobbler/merlin_156440754_6bc62ccb-7cec-4e1d-ab2c-556173542c93-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "blackberries, butter, corn, cornmeal, lemon, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 141}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/60 grams very cold unsalted butter (1/2 stick), cut into cubes, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 pounds/905 grams fresh, ripe blackberries (about 6 1/2 cups), lightly mashed with a potato masher", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar, plus more as needed", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 large ears sweet yellow corn", "1/3 cup/50 grams finely ground yellow cornmeal", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "2 tablespoons heavy cream", "4 teaspoons turbinado sugar, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees and grease the inside of a 9-by-9-inch square casserole dish with butter."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, toss the mashed blackberries with \u2154 cup granulated sugar, \u00bc cup flour, the lemon juice and \u00bc teaspoon salt.
