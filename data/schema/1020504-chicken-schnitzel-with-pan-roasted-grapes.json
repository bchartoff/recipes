{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Schnitzel With Pan-Roasted Grapes", "description": "No matter how you spin it, making schnitzel is a bit of a process. But by starting with thinly sliced chicken breasts, or chicken cutlets, this recipe removes the most time-consuming step \u2014 pounding the chicken \u2014 and makes schnitzel more doable on a weeknight. The contrast in temperatures and textures from the pan-roasted grapes and tangy sour cream make for perfectly balanced bites. Serve with a simple green salad with a lemony vinaigrette.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/dining/lh-chicken-schnitzel-with-grapes/lh-chicken-schnitzel-with-grapes-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken breast, dijon mustard, lemon, panko, red grapes, rosemary, sour cream, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 184}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 cups seedless red grapes, washed and dried (about 12 ounces)", "1 1/2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary", "1 tablespoon sherry or red wine vinegar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup sour cream", "Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs", "4 chicken breasts (about 1 pound total), pounded or sliced to about 1/2-inch thickness", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grapeseed, canola or safflower oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large (12-inch) saut\u00e9 pan over medium.
