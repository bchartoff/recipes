{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beautiful Soup (Vegetable Soup With Beets, Dill and Orange Zest)", "description": "This is a sweet and buttery tomato-onion soup that evolved, many years ago, toward a kind of borscht, but stopped short. Borscht tastes too earthy for my palate. Tomatoes and orange keep the flavor a bit brighter and more acidic. The name comes from the colors: orange carrots, carnelian tomatoes, magenta beets. I serve it at home, at least twice each winter, with snow-white dollops of sour cream floating on top. It looks wonderful, tastes good, and is very healthful. And without my needing to say a word about mincing or dicing, it teaches my children about the satisfaction of a job well done.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Celia Barbour"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/16/dining/Beautiful-Soup/Beautiful-Soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, beet, vegetables", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 259}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 376, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1537 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons butter or 3 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons olive oil", "3 medium onions, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces", "4 cloves garlic, minced", "2 small beets, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice", "4 to 5 medium carrots, cut into 1/2- inch dice", "4 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/2 medium celery root, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice", "3/4 cup chopped dill", "2 quarts beef or chicken stock", "1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes with their juice", "Finely grated zest and juice of 1 orange", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Sour cream, for garnish", "Dark whole wheat sour bread or other hearty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place flameproof casserole or other deep, wide pan over low heat and add butter or butter-oil mixture.
