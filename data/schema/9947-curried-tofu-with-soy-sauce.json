Use canned coconut milk with the caramelized onions. Like heavy cream, coconut milk will thicken a sauce, making it luxurious in almost no time. Then, to add contrasting texture, I decided to use nuts as well. Both walnuts and cashews do splendidly here. But the bottom line is the onions: they really must be browned carefully and thoroughly, without burning.
