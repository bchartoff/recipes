Still, there are a lot of steps involved. For ease of preparation, make the chicken filling up to a day in advance of serving \u2014 the actual building of the pie takes relatively little time. Or assemble the entire pie and refrigerate, unbaked, up to a day ahead. In Morocco, thin pastry leaves called warqa make the pie\u2019s flaky layers, but elsewhere most cooks use readily available phyllo dough. Dusting the exterior with powdered sugar might sound odd, but this traditional combination of sweet and savory is truly beguiling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/dining/20kitchrex1/merlin_150550410_e68503a6-a5ba-4fe1-8fef-80eca36601e0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pies and tarts, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thighs, golden raisins, phyllo, preserved lemon, ricotta, saffron, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 295}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 898, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "68 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "sodiumContent": "906 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds large skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (6 to 8 thighs)", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 teaspoon ground\u00a0turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon crumbled saffron", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "4 cups chicken broth", "1 cup golden raisins, soaked in hot water and drained", "1 pound ricotta", "2 tablespoons chopped mint", "3 tablespoons diced preserved lemon, skin only, rinsed", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1 cup roughly chopped toasted almonds", "1 cup roughly chopped toasted pistachios", "14 (12-by-17-inch) sheets phyllo", "3/4 pound unsalted butter\u00a0(3 sticks), melted", "Confectioners\u2019\u00a0sugar, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chicken filling: Season the chicken thighs generously on both sides with salt and pepper; go heavy on the pepper.
