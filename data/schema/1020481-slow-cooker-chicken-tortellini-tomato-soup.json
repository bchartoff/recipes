{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Chicken Tortellini Tomato Soup", "description": "This satisfying soup is an excellent one-pot dinner to come home to after a long day. It takes only 10 minutes to throw it together in the morning and 10 minutes to finish it in the evening. If you plan to be away for eight hours or more, set the cook time for four hours, then set the slow cooker to auto-switch to warm for the remaining time. (This prevents overcooking.) If you\u2019ll be home when the soup is done and can remove it from the heat, it\u2019s best to cook the chicken for five to six hours. Add only the tortellini you will eat right away. Leftover tortellini will get mushy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/sd-slow-cooker-chicken-tortellini-soup/merlin_161003151_306c755b-5a1d-4d1d-8431-6c9c610cd181-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "balsamic vinegar, chicken stock, chicken thighs, spinach, tomato, tortellini, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 827}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups chicken stock", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, preferably aged", "6 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano (from about 3 to 4 sprigs) or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano", "2 teaspoons onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 3/4 to 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "5 ounces baby spinach", "1 (8- to 10-ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini", "1 cup grated Parmesan, for serving", "Torn or sliced fresh basil, for serving", "Black pepper, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, whisk together the stock, wine and tomato paste until the paste dissolves.
