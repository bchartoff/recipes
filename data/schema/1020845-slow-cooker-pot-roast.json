{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Pot Roast", "description": "A hunk of beef slowly braised in red wine, herbs and garlic makes for a classic pot roast that\u2019s also easily customizable: Add the root vegetables and herbs you like best. The tough chuck roast needs about eight (or more) hours in a slow cooker to become fork tender, but the vegetables are better with a shorter cook time, so add them about four hours after the start. (If this is impossible because you\u2019ll be gone all day, you can add the vegetables in the morning; just make sure you cut them into large chunks and know that the vegetables will be quite soft.) Optional quick-pickled onions add welcome bright flavor and make this simple dish feel special.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/dining/sdg-slow-cooker-pot-roast/merlin_168064500_aefe72a7-0f2e-4ba0-94a5-92e5bdf05743-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, roasts", "keywords": "beef, garlic, herbs, onion, red wine, root vegetables, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 94}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 3 chunks", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "7 ounces frozen pearl onions (or 1 yellow or red onion, peeled and cut into wedges)", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 1/2 cups dry red wine", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "5 fresh woody herb sprigs, such as thyme, sage or rosemary (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme, sage or rosemary)", "1 to 1 1/2 pounds peeled root vegetables, such as a mix of carrots and parsnips, cut into 2-inch chunks", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature (optional)", "2 tablespoons flour (optional)", "1 cup red wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "7 ounces frozen pearl onions (or 1 yellow or red onion, peeled and thinly sliced)", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the beef generously all over with about 1 heaping tablespoon salt.

Cover and cook on low until the beef and vegetables are both very tender, an additional 4 to 5 hours. Check to see if the meat is tender by testing it with a fork; it should be juicy and flavorful, and pull apart easily. If the meat is not yet tender, cover and cook another 1 to 2 hours. (The amount of time can depend upon the leanness or fattiness of your cut, or how hot your slow cooker runs.) Using tongs and a slotted spoon, remove the beef and vegetables to a serving platter. Break the beef into large chunks to serve. Drizzle some cooking liquid over the top of the beef and vegetables, and top with drained pickled onions to serve. Discard the remaining cooking liquid or strain it, refrigerate it, discard the fat and freeze the remaining liquid as beef stock."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If you\u2019d prefer a thicker gravy, strain the cooking liquid into a medium pot and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, combine the butter and flour in a small bowl and knead it together with your fingers until it is uniform, almost like a dough. Once the liquid is boiling, drop the butter-flour mixture into the pot, whisking well to combine. Let it bubble until it is lightly thickened, about 5 minutes, then drizzle some gravy over the pot roast and vegetables, and top with the drained, pickled onions. Serve extra gravy on the side."}]}
