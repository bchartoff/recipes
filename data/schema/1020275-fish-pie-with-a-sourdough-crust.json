{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fish Pie With a Sourdough Crust", "description": "This British fish pie deviates from the traditional potato topping by using sourdough bread as a crust. The result leaves you with a happy balance of crispy bread bits on top and softer bits where the bread has absorbed some of the creamy sauce. You can easily make this pie your own by swapping out the sourdough for any other good-quality white loaf, using other cuts of fish or seafood, such as cod, trout or baby squid, and playing around with whatever herbs you might have on hand. The English mustard is quite a dominant flavor here, and cuts through the richness of the pie itself. If mustard isn\u2019t your thing, feel free to reduce the amount to 2 tablespoons.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/26OTTO-A/merlin_156111507_1df327aa-325c-4f63-afd7-d22fc4ddbb2f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, seafood", "keywords": "halibut, mustard powder, salmon, shrimp, sourdough, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 258}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, melted", "4 slices bacon (about 2 1/2 ounces/70 grams), thinly sliced crosswise", "1 large or 2 small leeks (about 10 ounces/300 grams), trimmed, halved lengthwise, sliced crosswise 3/4-inch/2-centimeters thick and washed well", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1/4 cup/40 grams all-purpose (plain) flour", "3 tablespoons mustard powder", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters whole milk", "1 cup/240 milliliters chicken stock", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup/10 grams roughly chopped fresh tarragon, plus 1 tablespoon reserved for garnish", "1/4 cup/10 grams roughly chopped fresh parsley, plus 1 tablespoon reserved for garnish", "2 tablespoons/5 grams roughly chopped fresh dill, plus 1 tablespoon reserved for garnish", "8 ounces/225 grams boneless, skinless salmon fillets, cut into roughly 1-inch/3-centimeter pieces", "8 ounces/225 grams boneless, skinless halibut fillets, cut into roughly 1-inch/3-centimeter pieces", "6 ounces/170 grams extra-large shrimp (prawns), peeled and deveined, tails removed", "2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)", "8 ounces/225 grams crustless sourdough, cut into 1-inch/3-centimeter cubes", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit/200 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saut\u00e9 pan or skillet, heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high.
