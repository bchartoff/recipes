By the 1860s, it was bottled. At one point, there were other \u201ccups,\u201d numbered 2 through 6, based on brandy, rum and other spirits. But the No. 1, a reddish tonic with citrusy and bitter notes, has always been the star, and it is not quite like anything else on the shelf.\n\nThe Pimm\u2019s Cup\u2019s skeletal components are nothing more than a measure of Pimm\u2019s and roughly three measures of either lemonade, lemon soda or ginger ale (your preference), served over ice in a long glass and typically garnished with cucumber.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/06/dining/06PIMMS2/06PIMMS2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink.", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cucumber, gin, pimm's no. 1, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 97}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup sugar", "1 1/4-inch-thick slice of unpeeled cucumber", "1 1/2 ounces Pimm\u2019s No. 1", "1/2 ounce gin, preferably Beefeater", "1 ounce lemon juice", "Seltzer or sparkling water", "Lemon wedges, for garnish", "Mint, for garnish."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make a simple syrup: in a small pan, heat sugar and 1 cup water; boil until sugar is melted.
