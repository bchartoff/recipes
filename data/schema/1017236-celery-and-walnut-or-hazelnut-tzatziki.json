{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Celery and Walnut (or Hazelnut) Tzatziki", "description": "Tzatziki, the creamy Greek salad made with cucumber, yogurt and lots of garlic is already one of my favorite dishes, and I think I may like this adaptation made with celery even more. The celery never loses its crunch or distinctive flavor. Walnuts and walnut oil add another dimension, which is nutty and crunchy. You could also try something new and use hazelnuts and hazelnut oil. Serve this as part of a mezze spread, as an appetizer or as a salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/14/science/receiphealthtzatziki/receiphealthtzatziki-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 195, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "362 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups very thinly sliced celery (about 1/2 pound celery stalks)", "Salt", "1 medium garlic clove (more to taste)", "1 1/4 cups Greek yogurt (more to taste)", "1/3 cup (1 ounce) finely chopped walnuts or hazelnuts", "2 tablespoons walnut oil or toasted hazelnut oil", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Chopped fresh dill (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place celery in a colander and salt generously.
