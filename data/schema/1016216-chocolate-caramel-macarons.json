{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Caramel Macarons", "description": "There are American macaroons, usually generously sized, coconut-based confections. And then there are French macarons, diminutive and almond imbued. This recipe skews French, but with a twist. Instead of the typical buttercream or ganache filling, there\u2019s a crunchy caramel candy layer in between the cocoa layers. These are fudgy little confections more like candy than cookies. They also happen to be both gluten-free and can be kosher for Passover, if you use kosher-for-Passover confectioners' sugar. You can make the macarons five days ahead, but don\u2019t fill them more than a day ahead. Or serve them without the caramel for something slightly less sweet, but just as intense.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/multimedia/clark-macaroon/clark-macaroon-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "About 2 1/2 dozen filled macarons", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, gluten-free, kosher", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 218}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 93, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "26 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["180 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar (1 3/4 cups), see note ", "95 grams almond flour or ground almonds (1 cup)", "30 grams natural unsweetened cocoa powder (5 tablespoons) ", "1/4 teaspoon fine salt ", "3 large egg whites, at room temperature ", "255 grams granulated sugar (1 cup plus 3 tablespoons)", "57 grams bittersweet chocolate (2 ounces), chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line two or three baking sheets with parchment or nonstick baking mats.
