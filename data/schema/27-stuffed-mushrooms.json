{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffed Mushrooms", "description": "This classic hors d'oeuvres recipe first appeared in The Times in a February 1981 column by Craig Claiborne on the then-popular topic of no-salt cooking. Mushrooms, he said, are \u201cthe one basic ingredient best suited to a no-salt cookery,\u201d noting a \u201cdepth of flavor\u201d and \u201ca meat-like consistency.\u201d  We may have relaxed our beliefs regarding our salt consumption, but this more than 30-year old recipe remains a reader favorite. It's also blessedly easy to make. After removing the stems from the mushrooms, you simply saut\u00e9 the caps with a little butter, lemon juice and black pepper (we won't tell if you add a little salt). Make a simple stuffing of chopped mushroom stems, shallots, garlic, celery, thyme, egg, bread crumbs and shredded Gouda. Stuff the mushroom caps, drizzle with butter and bake for about 15 minutes. See? The 1980s weren't so bad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Craig Claiborne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05COOKING-STUFFSHROOMS1/05COOKING-STUFFSHROOMS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, bread crumbs, cheese, mushroom, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 586}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 146, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "331 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds mushrooms", "4 tablespoons butter", "Juice of 1 lemon", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/3 cup coarsely chopped shallots", "1/2 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 cup coarsely chopped celery, optional", "1/4 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 small bay leaf", "1/4 cup coarsely chopped parsley", "1 egg, lightly beaten", "1/4 cup fine fresh bread crumbs", "1/4 cup grated cheese, preferably low-sodium cheese, such as Gouda", "Salt and pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove and reserve the mushroom stems.
