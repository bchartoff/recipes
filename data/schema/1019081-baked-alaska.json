{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Alaska", "description": "Baked alaska is a real toil, no doubt \u2014 you have to attend to the cake, the ice cream and the meringue, in the same way a mason lays stone. But there is plenty of opportunity for fun and flourish once the foundation is secure: You can divide the meringue among several pastry bags with varying sized tips to make dramatic and interesting variegated patterns of piped meringue. You can play with the shape of the cake by freezing the semifreddo in a coffee drip cone or a large-format flexible ice cube tray. And when you toast the meringue with a kitchen torch, you can hold the flame near and far, lingering in spots and moving briskly in others, to create extra drama and eye appeal. Try spooning flaming kirsch down its slopes. If you want to go even further, try replacing the white sugar with brown sugar in the meringue for a sophisticated pale-beige meringue that contrasts beautifully when toasted just to golden. Or see what you think of the results using other decorative colored sugars \u2014 keeping in mind, though, that after all that work down on your knees laying stone, you want to look up at a cathedral, not Fudgie the Whale!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/03/magazine/03mag-eat2/03eat2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H45M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, project", "keywords": "dessert, heavy cream, pistachio, pistachio paste", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 79}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 429, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "57 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "73 milligrams", "sugarContent": "49 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 1/2 tablespoons (150 grams) butter", "150 grams egg whites (from about 5 large eggs), room temperature", "1/8 cup (25 grams) whole almonds, toasted, cooled, then finely ground", "1/2 cup (80 grams) whole pistachios, toasted, cooled, then finely ground", "1 1/2 cups (160 grams) powdered sugar", "Pinch salt", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon (50 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons (10 grams) unsweetened pistachio paste", "1 cup (198 grams) sugar", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon (133 milliliters) freshly squeezed lemon juice", "2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) water", "6 large egg yolks", "Zest of 3 lemons", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups (355 milliliters) heavy cream", "2 cups (396 grams) sugar", "1 cup (245 grams) egg whites, room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the pistachio cake:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat.
