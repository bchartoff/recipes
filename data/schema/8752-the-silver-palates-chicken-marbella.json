With its chirpy tone and \u201cMoosewood\u201d-in-the-city illustrations, the book, published in time for Mother\u2019s Day in 1982, gave millions of home cooks who hadn\u2019t mastered the art of French cooking the courage to try sophisticated dishes like escabeche, wild mushroom soup and that new thing called pesto. This recipe, also in the book, came to The Times in a 2007 article celebrating the 25th anniversary edition. The briny-sweet combination once seemed as risky (capers! prunes!) as the East Village, but now it's considered as classic as Grand Central.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Christine Muhlke"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/03/dining/03COOKING-CHICKENMARBELLA1/03COOKING-CHICKENMARBELLA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, one pot, roasts", "keywords": "chicken, garlic, olive oil, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1728}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 928, "unsaturatedFatContent": "40 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "59 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "56 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1079 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup olive oil", "1/2 cup red wine vinegar", "1 cup pitted prunes", "1/2 cup pitted Spanish green olives", "1/2 cup capers, with a bit of juice", "6 bay leaves", "1 head of garlic, peeled and pur\u00e9ed", "1/2 cup fresh oregano, chopped, or 1/4 cup dried oregano", "2 teaspoons of salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper", "2 chickens, 3 1/2 to 4 pounds each, quartered", "1 cup dry white wine", "1 cup brown sugar", "2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, vinegar, prunes, olives, capers and juice, bay leaves, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper.
