{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Sausage, Squash and Sage Brown Butter", "description": "Whether you\u2019re after a night in with your special someone or your sweatpants, this is your pasta: a cozy combination of spicy sausage and squash that\u2019s glossed with nutty, sage-spiked butter and Parmesan. It\u2019s inspired by the cavatelli with sausage and browned sage butter at Frankies 457 Spuntino in Brooklyn \u2014 the most ordered dish on dates, according to the owners, but appealing no matter the occasion, according to us. The key to making the dish sing is the unsexy color (brown). You'll want to get a hard sear on the sausage and the squash, and let the butter bubble until brown and toasty. If you\u2019re looking for a vegetarian option, omit the sausage. The meat will be gone, but the comfort won't be.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/13/dining/as-squash-sage-pasta-horizontal/merlin_143375325_7b882119-5fdc-4972-afb0-e24e3fa0db6e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "butternut squash, hot italian sausage, parmesan, pasta, sage, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1214}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1073, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "97 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "62 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "842 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound cupped or tubed pasta, like orecchiette or penne", "1 pound hot Italian sausage links", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the pasta", "3/4 pound peeled butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 2 cups)", "Salt and pepper", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "8 sage leaves", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil.
