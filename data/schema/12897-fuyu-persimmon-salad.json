{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fuyu Persimmon Salad", "description": "The Fuyu persimmon, round and squat and rather tomato-shaped, is the kind you can eat raw. You want to buy the ones that have turned truly orange (if they are greenish-gold, let them ripen for a few days), then peel them and slice them. The flesh is firm but sweet. Eat them plain, in the Japanese fashion, with a pot of tea. Fuyus persimmons make wonderful salads, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/31/dining/31KITCH1_SPAN/31KITCH1_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "celery, persimmon, radicchio, fall, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 45}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 148, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "178 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 shallot, finely diced", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3 Fuyu persimmons", "1/2 cup thinly sliced tender celery stalks and leaves", "1 head radicchio, leaves torn into 2-inch wide ribbons", "Chunk of Parmesan, for shaving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the vinaigrette: put diced shallot in a small bowl with a pinch of salt.
