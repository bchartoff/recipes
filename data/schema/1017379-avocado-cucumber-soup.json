Each month, the 24 women of the club gather over their best tableware to share recipes and cooking tips. English cucumbers work well for this recipe, but cucumbers fresh from the garden are a great choice if you have them. The soup could also be blended and served chilled in small cups and passed around on a tray for a cocktail party.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/27/dining/cucumber-soup/cucumber-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, avocado, cucumber, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 117}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups plain yogurt (not Greek)", "2 cups half and half", "Salt and white pepper to taste", "1 1/2 avocados, finely diced", "3 small English cucumbers, peeled, seeded and finely-diced", "1 tablespoon grated onion", "1 cup cold chicken broth", "Fresh chives", "Crisp crumbled bacon", "Toasted, chopped almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine yogurt, half and half, salt and pepper in a large container and mix until smooth.
