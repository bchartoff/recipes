In just 15 minutes, you\u2019ll have nicely seared sausages, tomatoes and peppers, all of which have released juices that you should dunk bread into or spoon over pasta or rice. Experiment with adding cumin, paprika, oregano or red-pepper flakes in Step 1, or swap the garlic for scallions or red onion. You could also scatter crumbled feta, lemon slices, olives, pickled hot peppers or string beans across the top in the last few minutes of broiling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/as-sheet-pan-sausage-with-peppers-and-tomatoes/as-sheet-pan-sausage-with-peppers-and-tomatoes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, sausages, vegetables", "keywords": "garlic, peppers, sausage, shallot, tomatoes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1044}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh sausage, such as sweet or hot Italian sausage", "1 pound sweet or mild peppers, such as mini sweet peppers, bell or Cubanelle, seeded and sliced into 2-inch strips if large", "1 pound cherry or grape tomatoes", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "2 shallots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch wedges", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler with a rack 6 inches from heat source.
