Place this pulp, along with the tomatoes, nuts and piquillo peppers, in the bowl of a food processor. Squeeze the garlic from its skin and add it. Pulse a few times to blend it and then, leaving the processor on, pour olive oil through the feed tube in a thin stream. The sauce should become thick and creamy, like a mayonnaise. About 1 cup of oil should be enough. To sharpen it, season with salt and add a tablespoon or two of vinegar and red wine. Serve with grilled scallions. (Brush with olive oil, season with salt and grill until charred and soft or roast in a 350-degree oven; peel to tender part, then serve.)."}]}
