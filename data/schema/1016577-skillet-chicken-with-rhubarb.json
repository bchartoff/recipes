{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken With Rhubarb", "description": "In this savory skillet dinner, rhubarb, onions and garlic are simmered with white wine and butter into a rich sauce for browned chicken parts. I call for a whole, cut-up chicken here, so you\u2019ll have the different parts to choose from at the table. (Just be sure to watch the breasts carefully; they might finish cooking before the dark meat.) But you can use your favorite chicken part instead. Thighs and drumsticks work particularly well. This dish goes nicely with polenta, which also helps brighten the rather drab color of the brightly flavored sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/dining/mc-skillet-chicken-with-rhubarb/merlin_151792017_ac3b44e6-7f6b-4fc6-820f-551748c4d903-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday", "keywords": "chicken, green garlic, rhubarb, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 397}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1103, "unsaturatedFatContent": "48 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "77 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "81 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "1797 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (5 1/2-pound) whole chicken, cut into eight pieces", "1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1 teaspoon black pepper, more as needed", "5 sprigs thyme, preferably lemon thyme", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 bunch spring onions or scallions, white and light green stalks thinly sliced (slice and reserve greens for garnish)", "2 stalks green garlic, thinly sliced, or 2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "3/4 pound fresh rhubarb, cut into 1/2-inch dice (3 cups)", "1 tablespoon honey, or to taste", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken dry and season with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
