{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Stuffing", "description": "The challenge with developing a vegan version of classic Thanksgiving stuffing is figuring out how to achieve that signature texture without the eggs. In this recipe, a few simple steps make it possible: First, vegetable broth is added to the stuffing mixture twice; once while it\u2019s in the skillet, and again just before baking. Finely chopped, toasted pecans add texture, but also act as a sort of flour, absorbing the broth and binding the mixture together. Finally, the stuffing is baked under foil for the first 20 minutes, which ensures that the top doesn\u2019t dry out before the entire dish is finished. The end result is a traditional stuffing that will have everyone \u2014 vegans and otherwise \u2014 coming back for seconds.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gena Hamshaw"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/05/dining/gh-vegan-stuffing/merlin_163633290_a46c7dcb-e2e4-4871-9c7a-713012c298cb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, breads, stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "bread, broth, celery, onion, parsley, sage, thyme, vegan butter, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 192}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (1-pound) baguette or peasant loaf, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 10 cups)", "1/2 cup pecans\u00a0(2 ounces)", "4 tablespoons vegan butter, plus more for greasing the dish", "1 large onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)", "3 to 4 celery stalks, chopped (about 2 cups)", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage leaves", "2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves", "1/4 cup chopped parsley", "3 cups low-sodium vegetable broth", "Kosher salt and black pepper\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before you make the stuffing, place the bread cubes on a sheet pan and leave them out overnight, uncovered, to dry out.
