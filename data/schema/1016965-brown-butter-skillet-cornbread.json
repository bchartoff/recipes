{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Butter Skillet Cornbread", "description": "This lightly sweet cornbread has a crunchy, buttery crust, which comes from baking it in a hot skillet. If you have a cast-iron pan, this is the time to use it. The heavy, heat-retaining material will give you the darkest color (which equals the most flavor). But any large ovenproof skillet will work. And if you don\u2019t have a skillet big enough to hold all the batter, you can either halve the recipe or bake the cornbread in 9-by-13-inch pan. (Brown the butter first in a saucepan.) Your bread won\u2019t have the same dark crust, but the moist crumb flavored with brown butter and maple syrup is ample recompense.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/05/multimedia/clark-maple-cornbread/clark-maple-cornbread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "butter, buttermilk, yellow cornmeal, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2068}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 265, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "341 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks)/170 grams unsalted butter", "1/2 cup/120 ml maple syrup", "2 1/4 cups/530 ml buttermilk", "3 large eggs", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams yellow cornmeal, fine or medium-coarse grind", "1/2 cup/65 grams whole wheat flour", "1/2 cup/60 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 tablespoons/18 grams baking powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons/9 grams kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon/5 grams baking soda"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
