{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Potted Shrimp", "description": "In the history of British cuisine, potting perishable foods \u2014 that is, sealing ingredients in a crock under a thin layer of clarified butter \u2014 was a way to preserve them. Thanks to modern refrigeration, preservation is no longer the point, but luscious, buttery potted dishes are still popular throughout Britain. Here, diced shrimp are aggressively seasoned with anchovy, celery seed, lemon zest and garlic before being sealed into ramekins. Potted shrimp is a very rich dish, best served in small quantities with hot toast on the side to melt the solidified butter back into a creamy sauce. Or, scoop out the shrimp and butter and mix it with hot pasta to create an instant scampi-like dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/23/dining/spiced-potted-shrimp/spiced-potted-shrimp-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "anchovies, anchovy fillets, celery seeds, shrimp, thyme, appetizer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 350, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "399 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups unsalted butter (3 sticks)", "4 anchovy fillets, chopped", "2 teaspoons fresh thyme or lemon thyme, minced, more for garnish", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon mace (or nutmeg)", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Pinch cayenne", "Pinch celery seed", "1 pound peeled shrimp, cut into 1/4-inch dice", "1 garlic clove, grated on a Microplane or minced", "Lemon wedges, for serving", "Tabasco, for serving", "Hot toast, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
