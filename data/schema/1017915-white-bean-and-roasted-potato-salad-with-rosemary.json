{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Bean and Roasted Potato Salad With Rosemary", "description": "Freshly cooked white beans hold their shape better than canned ones, so unless you\u2019re really pinched for time, cook the beans yourself for this hearty, lively winter salad. Serve it as a side dish for roasted meats or chicken. If you omit the anchovies in the dressing (use capers instead), it would be an excellent meatless main course. If you have time, it's best to give the beans a proper soak (4 to 12 hours); if not, just tack 30 to 60 minutes onto the cooking time, adding more water as needed to keep them entirely covered.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/13/dining/13APPE2/13APPE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, beans, greens, yukon gold potato, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 156}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 359, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "474 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups dried cannellini or Great Northern beans", "1 1/2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt, more to taste", "2 bay leaves, torn", "1 garlic clove, smashed", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 3/4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch chunks", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "8 cups hearty winter greens, kale, collard greens, cabbage or mustard greens", "2 teaspoons lemon juice, more to taste", "4 anchovy fillets (see note)", "2 garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, more to taste", "Large pinch kosher salt, more to taste", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon", "1 tablespoon chopped rosemary", "Large pinch red chile flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the beans in a bowl or pot, cover with water by 2 inches and add 1 1/2 tablespoons salt.
