{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caesar Cocktail", "description": "Sometimes it seems there are as many Caesar recipes as there are Canadians of drinking age. The building blocks are usually the same: vodka, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, lime juice, spices (for the rim of the glass) and clam-tomato juice, be it the standard Mott\u2019s Clamato or one of the newer brands. But every bar and citizen has a special twist, usually in the departments of spices and garnish. This recipe is an adaptation of the one used by the bartender London Richard at his restaurant Sorso, near Calgary, Alberta. For vodka, he prefers Calgary\u2019s own Burwood Vodka. For the spiced rim, the nationally popular mix known as Montreal steak spice plays a part. The garnish is a pickled pineapple and a bacon-wrapped, cream-cheese stuffed pickle. This version is a bit less complicated. But since a Caesar is a form of individual expression, follow your creative urge wherever it takes you. As long as you\u2019ve got the Clamato and a decently complex spiced rim, you\u2019ll end up with a wonderfully savory eye-opener that may render the Bloody Mary a dim memory.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/17/dining/17Caesar4/17Caesar4-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "canadian", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "clamato juice, vodka", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 198, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "490 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon celery salt", "1/2 teaspoon garlic salt", "1/2 teaspoon steak seasoning", "1/4 ounce lime juice (from about 1/2 a lime), and more for coating the rim of the glass", "2 ounces vodka", "2 dashes Worcestershire sauce", "2 dashes hot sauce", "4 ounces Mott\u2019s Clamato or other tomato-clam juice", "A pickled vegetable (green beans are popular), for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Blend the celery salt, garlic salt and steak seasoning.
