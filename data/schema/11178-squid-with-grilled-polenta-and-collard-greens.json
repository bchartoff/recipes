Hold the sac with one hand and with the other reach inside and pull away the head and tentacles. With your fingers, scrape away the dark skin on the outside of the sac under cold running water.

Cut the tentacles from the head above the eyes. Reserve the tentacles and discard everything else. Cut the squid in rings a quarter of an inch wide. Cut the tentacles in half.
