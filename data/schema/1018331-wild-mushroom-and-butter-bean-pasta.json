{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wild Mushroom and Butter Bean Pasta", "description": "This is a great pasta for autumn, hearty and deeply flavorful. Wild golden chanterelle mushrooms are especially nice and often available in the fall; choose small, firm, unblemished ones. Otherwise use a mixture of pale oyster mushrooms, including royal trumpets. End-of-summer fresh shelling beans work well here, or any dried white bean, such as cannellini. The simple complementary flavors of olive oil, pancetta, garlic and rosemary are just right, mingling with lightly browned mushrooms and creamy beans. Make sure to keep the pasta firmly al dente. To get the best rosemary flavor, chop it at the last moment, and toss a rosemary sprig into the pot while the pasta is cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/05/dining/05KITCH-WEB1/05KITCH-WEB1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "butter beans, chanterelle mushrooms, pasta, rosemary, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 225}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 409, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "478 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups fresh butter beans or other shelling beans (from about 2 pounds in the pod), or 1 cup dried cannellini or other white bean, cleaned", "1 small bay leaf", "Salt and pepper", "3 ounces thickly sliced pancetta or slab bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide lardons", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium red onion, diced", "12 ounces wild chanterelle mushrooms, thickly sliced or chopped or a mixture of pale oyster mushrooms", "3 or 4 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, to taste", "1 teaspoon freshly chopped rosemary, plus a sprig for the pasta pot", "1 pound bucatini, spaghetti or other dry pasta", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley", "Parmesan or pecorino cheese, grated (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put beans in a pot and cover with water by 2 inches.
