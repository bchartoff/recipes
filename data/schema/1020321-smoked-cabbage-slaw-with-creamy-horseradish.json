{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoked Cabbage Slaw With Creamy Horseradish", "description": "This slaw acquires its smoke flavor not through grilling the greens, but by cold smoking. The advantage is that you flavor the leaves with smoke without cooking them, so the cabbage remains audibly crisp. Cold smoking can be done on a grill or in a smoker, or even in your kitchen using a stove-top smoker or hand-held smoker. The secret is to smoke the shredded cabbage over a pan of ice to keep it from cooking. Horseradish and mustard fire up the traditional creamy mayonnaise dressing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/07/dining/02slawrex3/merlin_158645790_af947f47-c4a3-4fcd-84bc-65f277e34e18-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, slaws, vegetables", "keywords": "apple, carrot, celery seeds, cider vinegar, green cabbage, horseradish, mayonnaise, fall, summer, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 Honey Crisp or other firm apple", "1 small head green cabbage (about 1 1/4 pounds), quartered through the core", "1 small white onion, peeled and quartered", "2 carrots, trimmed and peeled", "1/2 cup yellow raisins", "Ice, for smoking", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "3 tablespoons prepared horseradish", "2 tablespoons cider vinegar, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon celery seed", "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set up your smoker following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and heat to 225 degrees.
