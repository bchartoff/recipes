It requires no eggs either, which means no custard, so it's much simpler to make.\n\nThe recipe even works with skim milk, if not quite as brilliantly. With skim milk or half-and-half, this is a much less fat-laden ice cream than one made with six eggs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/31/dining/Custard/Custard-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 generous pint", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "cornstarch, cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 210}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups light cream, half-and-half or milk (whole or skim), or a combination", "1/2 cup sugar", "Pinch of salt", "1 vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 tablespoons cornstarch"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put 2 cups cream, half-and-half or milk, the sugar and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat.
