The dish is served in a lacquered octagonal container resembling a wooden candy box with a lid. When the lid is lifted, there is a center section in which small, round, thin pancakes are stacked. Around the center are eight receptacles that hold various savory, finely shredded foods to be added to each pancake before folding, dipping into a mustard-soy sauce and eating. The fillings can vary from table to table but normally include such things as shredded beef, mushrooms, carrots and cucumbers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Craig Claiborne"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beef, mushroom, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["8 large dried Chinese mushrooms", "1/4 pound boneless loin of beef without fat", "1 long, smooth-skinned cucumber of the sort sometimes referred to as burpless", "1 onion, about 1/8 pound, peeled", "1 carrot, about 1/4 pound, trimmed and scraped", "24 Korean pancakes (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5951-korean-pancakes\">see recipe</a>)", "1 tablespoon Seasoning Sauce (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5952-seasoning-sauce\">see recipe</a>)", "Peanut, corn or vegetable oil", "Salt to taste if desired", "3 eggs, separated", "1 teaspoon cold water", "Mustard sauce (see recipe)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the mushrooms in a mixing bowl, and add warm water to cover.
