{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef Barley Soup With Lemon", "description": "With a higher ratio of broth to barley than one usually sees, and the addition of plenty of fresh baby spinach, this beef barley soup is a little lighter than most of its kind. However, it\u2019s still a substantial, satisfying meal that gets a heady aroma from spices (coriander, cumin and paprika) and a brightness from lemon. If you like your meals with a kick, top this with thinly sliced jalape\u00f1o, which will wilt slightly from the heat of the soup. Leftovers freeze perfectly for at least three months, though if using the jalape\u00f1o, don\u2019t add it until serving time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/15/dining/15APPE1/15APPE1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, beef stew meat, leeks, parsnip, pearl barley, spinach, turnip, fall, winter, high fiber", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1466}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 320, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "809 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound beef stew meat, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1 teaspoon black pepper, more as needed", "2 tablespoons olive oil, more as needed", "3 small or 2 large leeks, thinly sliced", "3 celery stalks, diced", "1 fennel bulb, diced", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "3/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika", "Large pinch cayenne, optional", "1 quart beef or chicken stock", "3 sage sprigs", "2 rosemary sprigs", "2 bay leaves", "2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks", "2 parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks", "2 large turnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "3/4 cups pearled barley", "8 ounces/8 cups baby spinach or baby kale", "1/4 cup chopped parsley", "Finely grated zest of 1 small lemon, plus fresh lemon juice to taste", "Thinly sliced jalape\u00f1os or other chiles, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season beef with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
