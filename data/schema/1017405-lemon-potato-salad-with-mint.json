{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Potato Salad With Mint", "description": "This light and refreshing potato salad is the antithesis of the usual, creamy, mayonnaise-based recipes. The mint and scallion add a bright, herbal flavor while the sprinkle of chile lends a kick. Make this the morning you plan to serve it and let it marinate at room temperature all day long. Or refrigerate for longer storage but be sure to bring it to room temperature before serving. Other herbs like cilantro, parsley, tarragon and sage can be substituted for the mint; adjust the quantity to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20POTATO3/20POTATO3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "mint, potato, Turkish pepper, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 874}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 212, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "333 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds small waxy white or yellow potatoes, roughly about the same size", "Juice of 1 lemon, more for serving", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and light green parts, more for serving", "1/4 cup torn mint leaves, more for serving", "1/4 teaspoon Turkish pepper, more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place whole unpeeled potatoes in a large pot with enough salted water to cover by 1 inch.
