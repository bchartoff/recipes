{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Chicken Legs With Wild Mushrooms", "description": "A good roasted chicken is a simple pleasure, but a braised chicken dish is always more interesting. Here, dried wild mushrooms, smoked bacon and red wine perfume the sauce to give these chicken legs depth and character, with a flavor nearly similar to a game bird. Using turkey broth makes this braise even more heady. For a quick, concentrated broth, simmer 2 pounds of meaty turkey wings with 6 cups water for about an hour. Finding a\u00a0dried wild mushroom is not like hunting for its fresh counterpart in the forest. Most Italian delis and nearly all supermarkets sell little packets of dried wild mushrooms.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/28/dining/28kitchenrex1/merlin_146065869_2d15c95d-3132-49e5-bfc6-7ed0e2c77a6c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "bacon, chicken legs, morels, porcini, potato, wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 214}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 833, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "51 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "46 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1653 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce dried porcini", "1 ounce dried morels", "6 large chicken legs (about 4 pounds)", "Salt and pepper", "4 tablespoons unsalted\u00a0butter (1/2 stick)", "2 cups finely diced onion", "3 ounces thick-cut bacon, sliced crosswise 1/4-inch wide", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Pinch of cayenne", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 cup red wine", "4 cups turkey or chicken broth", "1 bay leaf", "1 large thyme sprig", "1 1/2 pounds small yellow-fleshed potatoes", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse porcini with warm water (they are often sandy), then place in a small bowl, cover with hot water and soak until softened, about 15 minutes.\u00a0In a separate bowl, soak the morels in hot water."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
