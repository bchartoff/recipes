{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian Mushroom Wellington", "description": "Classic beef Wellington is a technical feat in which a tenderloin is topped with foie gras or mushroom duxelles, then wrapped in puff pastry and baked. This vegetarian version is less exacting yet just as impressive. Seared portobello mushrooms are layered with apple cider-caramelized onions and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, which are seasoned with soy sauce for flavor and bolstered with walnuts for texture. The rich mushroom filling is vegan, and the entire dish can easily be made vegan, too. Swap in vegan puff pastry, a butter substitute in the port reduction and caramelized onions, and an egg substitute for brushing the puff pastry. If you want to prepare ahead, saut\u00e9 the mushrooms and onions in advance and refrigerate them, then assemble the dish the day you plan to bake and serve it. Prepare the port reduction as the Wellington bakes, or skip it entirely and serve with cranberry sauce for a touch of tangy sweetness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/05/dining/aw-mushroom-wellington/merlin_163633167_473a653a-a909-42e2-94c3-0788f950a163-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastries, vegetables", "keywords": "apple cider, mushroom, port, portobello, puff pastry, rosemary, thyme, yellow onion, fall, winter, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 832}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large portobello mushrooms, each about 3 inches wide (8 to 10 ounces total)", "1/2 cup\u00a0plus\u00a05 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 pounds mixed mushrooms, such as shiitake, oyster and cremini", "4 shallots, finely chopped (about 1 packed cup)", "6 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary", "1/3 cup port, or 1 to 2 tablespoons good-quality aged balsamic vinegar", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "1 cup finely chopped toasted walnuts (about 4 ounces)", "Ice, for cooling", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 medium yellow onions (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into 1/4-inch rounds", "3/4 teaspoon light or dark brown sugar", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1 cup apple cider or apple juice", "1 tablespoon good-quality aged balsamic vinegar (optional)", "All-purpose flour, for dusting", "1 (14-ounce) package puff pastry", "1 large egg, beaten", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large shallot, minced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns", "1 1/2 cups good-quality port", "1 1/2 cups vegetable stock", "3 fresh thyme\u00a0sprigs", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wipe the portobello mushrooms clean using barely moistened paper towels.
