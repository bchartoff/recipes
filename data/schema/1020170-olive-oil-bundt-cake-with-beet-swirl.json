{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Olive Oil Bundt Cake With Beet Swirl", "description": "Sweet roasted beets and extra-virgin olive oil add earthiness to this delicate Bundt cake, a baking project that promises stunning results. Roasting the beets beforehand concentrates their sweetness, and stacking thick layers of batter \u2014 one flavored with olive oil, the other with beets \u2014 creates bold swoops of red within the baked cake. Allow the cake to cool completely before slicing to avoid blurring the lines. Because of its lightly sweet notes, this cake is equally at home at breakfast or brunch, as a snack or dessert. To dress it up further, serve with lightly sweetened whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/dining/jg-beet-cake/merlin_153033708_8321aaec-cb9a-484a-ab8a-9f855223e5b6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "beets, lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 141}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 398, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "327 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds/570 grams raw beets, trimmed, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil plus 2 tablespoons, and more for greasing", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3 1/2 cups/450 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "1 tablespoon lemon zest plus 1/2 cup/120 milliliters fresh lemon juice (from 3 or 4 lemons)", "5 eggs, beaten", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
