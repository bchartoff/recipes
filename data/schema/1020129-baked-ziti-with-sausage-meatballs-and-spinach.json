{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Ziti With Sausage Meatballs and Spinach", "description": "Baked ziti is meant to feed a crowd, and this one surely does. \u201cCheater\u201d meatballs made with uncased Italian sausage are strewn throughout the sauce for heft, and baby spinach lends a pop of color. Because ricotta has a tendency to dry out when baked, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is added to ensure a more velvety texture, but sour cream thinned out with a little heavy cream works just as well. The whole dish can be assembled and baked ahead the day before. Bring it to room temperature before warming, then broil right before serving for crisp edges.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/28/dining/ch-baked-ziti-with-sausage-meatballs/ch-baked-ziti-with-sausage-meatballs-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, pastas", "keywords": "cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, pasta, pecorino, ricotta, sausage, spinach, tomato, ziti, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 391}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 567, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "906 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound sweet Italian sausage (pork, turkey or chicken), casing removed", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves, roughly chopped", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "2 (28-ounce) cans whole San Marzano tomatoes with their juices", "5 ounces baby spinach", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound ziti, penne or other short, tubular pasta", "1 (15-ounce) container ricotta", "7 ounces cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (about 1 scant cup)", "1 cup grated pecorino", "3/4 pound fresh mozzarella, cut or torn into 1/2-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using your hands, shape the sausage into about 35 (1-inch) meatballs."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a deep 12-inch skillet or a Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium.
