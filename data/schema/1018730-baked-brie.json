Don\u2019t be tempted to use a fancy, artisan brie from a cheese shop here. This recipe works best with the regular kind of brie you find at the supermarket; fancier bries may leak out of their pastry. Choose any flavor jam for the topping. Orange or ginger marmalade will give you something tangier than, say, raspberry and cherry jam, which are sweeter, more mellow options.\u00a0While a wedge of brie will work in this recipe, a round of brie looks prettiest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/06/dining/25COOKING-BAKEDBRIE1/25COOKING-BAKEDBRIE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 or more servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, brie, jam, puff pastry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 951}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 43, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "32 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 piece of brie, 4 to 8 ounces, cold", "1 sheet puff pastry, chilled but not frozen", "2 tablespoons thick jam or marmalade, any flavor", "1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water", "1 tablespoon demerara sugar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.\u00a0Using a large chef\u2019s knife, cut the white rind off the brie and discard (this works best when the cheese is very cold)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Roll the chilled dough to about 1/8-inch thick.
