{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Lemon Pasta", "description": "This astonishingly delicious pasta dish is surprisingly easy to make. Just combine the zest of two lemons, heavy cream, salt and pepper in a saucepan, and let it come to a boil. Pour over freshly cooked egg noodles, add fresh lemon juice and toss. Cook for a couple minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly and cloaks the noodles in a rich, creamy, lemony brightness. It's luxurious weeknight cooking at its best.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Barbara Kafka"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/dining/bk-creamy-lemon-pasta/merlin_148333125_37bb211c-7509-43e3-891f-39a1930df3ed-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "egg noodles, heavy cream, lemon juice, fall, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2729}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 361, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "270 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces wide egg noodles", "Zest and juice of 2 lemons; zest cut in very thin strips 1 inch long", "1 cup heavy cream", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Lots of freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
