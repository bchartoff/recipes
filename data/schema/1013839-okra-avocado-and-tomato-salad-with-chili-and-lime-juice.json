{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Okra, Avocado and Tomato Salad With Chili and Lime Juice", "description": "This lively combination is inspired by one of my favorite Mexican salads, which is made with diced cooked cactus paddles (nopales), onion, tomato and avocado. Cactus paddles are gooey, like okra, so I figured okra could stand in for nopales in this salad. The result is prettier and, I think, tastier -- and certainly easier to work with than cactus. There is no need for oil in this salad. If you want less viscosity, you can marinate the okra in vinegar and salt first (see this week\u2019s other recipes), but you will lose the beautiful color. You must serve this right away.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/14/science/15recipehealth/15recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves four to six", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "avocado, okra, tomato, healthy, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 28}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 97, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "471 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound okra", "1 jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded if desired, minced", "1 Hass avocado, cut in small dice", "1 pound tomatoes, cut in small dice", "1 small white or red onion, chopped, soaked for five minutes in cold water, then drained and rinsed optional", "Salt to taste", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "5 to 6 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "1 to 2 ounces crumbled queso fresco or feta for serving optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the stems and tips from the okra, and place it in a steamer above 1 inch of boiling water.
