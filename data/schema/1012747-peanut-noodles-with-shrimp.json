{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peanut Noodles With Shrimp", "description": "Don't order takeout. You can make these super easy Thai-inspired peanut noodles at home for a fraction of the cost. First, make a quick peanut sauce of peanut butter (chunky or smooth, your call), lime juice, lime zest, sugar, fish sauce and water. Toss rice noodles into boiling water and remove from heat to soften. Meanwhile, saut\u00e9 the shrimp with a heady combination of scallions, carrots, garlic and chile (for a meatless version, leave out the shrimp or substitute tofu). When the noodles are soft, but not mushy, drain and toss with the shrimp, vegetables and peanut sauce. Garnish with herbs and lime wedges. Now go directly to your junk drawer and throw away all of your takeout menus.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/dining/23COOKING-PEANIES-SHRIMP2/23COOKING-PEANIES-SHRIMP2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, one pot", "keywords": "main course, peanut butter, rice noodles, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 709}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 706, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "100 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1049 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "3 limes", "1/3 cup peanut butter, chunky or smooth", "1 tablespoon sugar", "2 tablespoons nam pla (fish sauce)", "12 to 16 ounces rice noodles (not vermicelli)", "2 tablespoons peanut oil", "1 pound raw shrimp, peeled", "1 bunch scallions, sliced", "2 grated carrots (about 1 cup)", "2 tablespoons chopped garlic", "1 minced fresh hot chile, like jalape\u00f1o or Thai, or more to taste", "Freshly ground pepper", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, mint or Thai basil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it.
