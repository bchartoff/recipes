{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Glazed Carrots With Orange and Ginger", "description": "When carrots are cooked, it\u2019s often a sad affair. They are boiled to death and presented almost as an apology. Yet when they\u2019re treated with the respect they deserve, even ordinary supermarket carrots can be among the most reliable and enjoyable of vegetables, especially from fall through spring. This braise-and-glaze technique can be varied at will and can also be used with other roots, like beets, turnips and radishes. Once you have the hang of the technique, changing the flavorings is a snap. Try substituting a mixture of half balsamic vinegar, half water or soy sauce similarly diluted for the orange juice, adding a few cloves of peeled garlic with the carrots. Or add a half cup or so of chopped onions, shallots, scallions or leeks, or of chopped pitted dates or raisins, dried currants or even dried tomatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/15/dining/15COOKING-GLAZED-CARROTS2/15COOKING-GLAZED-CARROTS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "carrot, ginger, orange juice, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 258}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 118, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "335 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound carrots, trimmed and peeled if necessary, cut into 1/4-inch coins or sticks", "2 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon minced or grated peeled fresh ginger", "1/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice", "1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "Chopped fresh parsley, dill, mint, basil or chervil leaves for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all ingredients except lemon juice and garnish in a saucepan no more than 6 inches across.
