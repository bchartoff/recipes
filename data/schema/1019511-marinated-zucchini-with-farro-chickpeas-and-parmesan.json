{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Marinated Zucchini With Farro, Chickpeas and Parmesan", "description": "Zucchini\u2019s a tricky vegetable, prone to mushiness. Here, we avoid those pitfalls: By pan-frying planks, you\u2019ll get tender, rich insides with golden-brown exteriors. And when you pair these cooked pieces with delicate raw zucchini ribbons (don\u2019t call them zoodles!) you\u2019ll get just a glimpse of this vegetable\u2019s full potential. A generous handful of arugula, and a bed of farro and chickpeas, fill out the rest of the meal. Cooking the chickpeas along with the farro may seem strange, but it will make the canned beans softer, creamier, and more flavorful than simply dumping them into the salad. For added crunch and flavor in every bite, roughly chop the zucchini noodles and the planks before tossing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jampel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/23/dining/farro-zucchini/farro-zucchini-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 112}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 377, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "496 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup farro", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "1 pound small zucchini and/or summer squash, ends trimmed", "7 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 garlic clove, minced", "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "1 cup of your favorite soft, fragrant herb, like basil, mint, tarragon, or a combination, roughly torn or cut", "Black pepper", "2 cups arugula", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "Parmesan, for shaving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse and drain the farro and chickpeas.
