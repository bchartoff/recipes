{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tomato, Fresh Fig and Blue Cheese Salad", "description": "Whether you get them from your backyard garden or the local farmers' market, tomatoes are one of summer\u2019s sweetest staples. In the kitchen, one of the best things a cook can do with a surfeit of ripe summer tomatoes is not to cook them. With such tasty beauties available (and given the tomato-pleasing heat), salads make more sense. Start simply by slicing big tomatoes into rounds and cutting smaller ones into wedges and the cherry and grape varieties in half. Very gently toss them with fresh herbs, balsamic vinegar, olive oil and good salt. Use whatever you\u2019ve got to hand to dress up the pile. Here, we\u2019ve used some crumbled blue cheese for tang, fresh figs for sweetness and a sprinkle of toasted pine nuts for crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/08/dining/08APPE/08APPE-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "cheese, figs, tomato, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 494}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 237, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "230 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3 tablespoons pine nuts", "1 large or 2 small ripe tomatoes, about 8 ounces, thinly sliced", "1/2 pound fresh figs, cut into quarters", "1 ounce crumbled blue cheese, like Fourme d\u2019Ambert, more to taste", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar and salt.
