{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shortbread Plum Tart With Honey and Cinnamon", "description": "Based on a classic\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017854-gateau-breton\">g\u00e2teau Breton</a>, this buttery tart is filled with a fresh plum compote flavored with honey, rosemary and cinnamon instead of the usual pur\u00e9ed prunes. You can make the compote and dough a few days ahead, but this tart is best served within 24 hours of baking. After that, the center starts to turn mushy from the moisture released by the fruit. Serve it on its own, or with a dollop of whipped cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/05/dining/05apperex1/merlin_142874943_c1fed7ef-3a45-4d92-b2ae-40eb56420209-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, fall, summer, honey, plum", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 288}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 353, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "61 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/200 grams plus 1 to 3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 1/3 cups/290 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "8 ounces/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), diced, plus more for greasing pan", "1 large egg", "5 large egg yolks", "4 large plums, halved, pitted, and sliced 1/4-inch thick (about 2 1/4 cups)", "2 tablespoons full-flavored honey such as wildflower", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 small sprig rosemary (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, process 1 cup sugar until powdery and fine, about 1 minute.
