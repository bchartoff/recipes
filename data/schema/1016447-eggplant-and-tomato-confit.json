Unlike its cousin, ratatouille, the vegetables are cooked together for a very long time here, until they meld into a confit. The authentic dish includes a couple of finely chopped anchovies, which season the dish as it simmers. They\u2019re optional here, but worth including for a deep, rich flavor. They won\u2019t make the dish taste like anchovies.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/09/10/health/nutrition/eggplant.tomconfit.jpg/eggplant.tomconfit.jpg-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 23}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 124, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "766 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds (2 large or 3 medium) eggplant, roasted", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 medium onions, finely chopped", "3 to 4 large garlic cloves, to taste, minced or pressed", "3 pounds fresh ripe tomatoes, or 2 (28-ounce) cans, with juice, peeled, seeded and chopped", "1/8 teaspoon sugar", "2 anchovy fillets, soaked for 5 minutes in water, rinsed and finely chopped (optional)", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 fresh basil sprig", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon slivered fresh basil leaves (more to taste)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Roast the eggplant, allow to cool and cut into 1-inch dice."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, heavy nonstick skillet and add the onions.
