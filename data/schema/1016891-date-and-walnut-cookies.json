It was contributed by Wilma Miller, who credits the recipe to her great-aunt. Ms. Miller wrote that the original recipe called for two pounds of walnuts, but that she prefers it with pecans \u201cand not that many.\u201d That makes sense. Mixing in even a pound of nuts requires the arms of a sturdy farm wife. The recipe yields enough for an entire church supper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19IOWA/19IOWA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 7 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, dates, pecans, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 331}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 110, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "59 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/350 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon/5 grams salt", "1 teaspoon/3 grams cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon/1 1/2 grams ground cloves", "8 ounces/2 sticks/227 grams soft unsalted butter", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams light brown sugar", "3 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 tablespoon/13 grams baking soda", "1 pound/450 grams chopped pitted dates", "1 pound/450 grams chopped walnuts or pecans", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
