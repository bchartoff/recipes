{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "New Mexican Pozole", "description": "In New Mexico, there is abundance and generosity and plenty of comfort food at holiday parties. Posole, the savory and hearty, rather soupy stew made from dried large white corn kernels simmered for hours, is traditional and easy to prepare. Stir in a ruddy red pur\u00e9e of dried New Mexico chiles to give the stew its requisite kick. This is satisfying, nourishing, fortifying fare. The corn stays a little bit chewy in a wonderful way (canned hominy never does), and the spicy broth is beguiling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/04/dining/04KITCH_SPAN/04KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, pozole", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 533}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 588, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "54 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "567 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds dried hominy (posole), available in Latino groceries, soaked overnight in cold water", "3 ounces dried red New Mexico chiles (about 10 large chiles)", "2 pounds fresh pork belly, cut in 2-inch cubes", "2 pounds pork shoulder, not too lean, cut in 2-inch chunks", "Salt and pepper", "1 large yellow onion, peeled, halved and stuck with 2 cloves", "1 bay leaf", "1 tablespoon chopped garlic", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted until fragrant and coarsely ground", "2 cups finely diced white onion, soaked in ice water, for garnish", "Lime wedges", "Roughly chopped cilantro, for garnish", "Toasted Mexican oregano, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain soaked hominy and put in large soup pot.
