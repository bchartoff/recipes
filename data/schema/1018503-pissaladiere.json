{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pissaladi\u00e8re", "description": "Sweet, caramelized onions, briny anchovies and olives make the up the topping for this traditional Proven\u00e7al tart. This version calls for a yeasted dough, which makes the tart somewhat like a pizza. But puff pastry, which Julia Child preferred, is also traditional, and quite a bit richer. If you\u2019d rather use that, substitute a 12- to 16-ounce package for the yeast dough, and bake the tart at 375 degrees until the bottom and sides are golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Pissaladi\u00e8re makes great picnic fare, in addition to being a terrific appetizer or lunch dish.
