{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Sugar Caramel Corn", "description": "This crunchy caramel corn gets its complex spiciness from a combination of turmeric and coconut palm sugar. The recipe is adapted from Jessica Koslow, of Sqirl restaurant in Los Angeles, who riffed off a dish her friend, the chef Angela Dimayuga, brought for Thanksgiving one year. Make sure to use a very large pot here, you\u2019ll need plenty of room to toss the popped corn with the caramel. This popcorn keeps, stored airtight at room temperature, for up to 5 days. But chances are it will be gone long before.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/27/dining/27apperex2/merlin_139780512_5285200c-134f-4349-8e20-b1254d264f55-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "About 13 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "coconut palm sugar, virgin coconut oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "98 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons virgin coconut oil", "3 tablespoons grapeseed oil", "1/2 cup popcorn kernels", "1 cup coconut palm sugar", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 1/4 teaspoons turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a very large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stock pot set over medium-high heat, heat both oils and 3 popcorn kernels.
