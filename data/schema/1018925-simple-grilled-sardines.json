{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Simple Grilled Sardines", "description": "Grilled fresh sardines are often offered on restaurant menus, but it\u2019s very easy to make them at home, whether over hot coals or under the broiler. At the fishmonger, look for firm, shiny, glistening specimens. Sardines are a sustainable fish choice and are high in healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Most importantly, they are extremely delicious. For a Mediterranean touch, grill the fish on fig leaves: After cooking the sardines on one side, lay four fig leaves on the grill and place two fish, cooked side up, on top of each leaf to finish cooking. The fig leaves will add a subtle perfume to the sardines (they look beautiful, too), but they are not edible.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/20/dining/20KITCHEN2/20KITCHEN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, fennel, sardines", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 297, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "683 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 fresh sardines (about 1 1/2 pounds), cleaned and scaled", "Salt and pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 medium fennel bulbs, trimmed and very finely sliced", "Lemon wedges", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire or stovetop grill pan, or light the broiler."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season sardines inside and out with salt and pepper and paint both sides lightly with olive oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay sardines on the grill and cook them on one side for about 2 minutes, until nicely browned.
