{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bouillabaisse With Orange Zest, Fennel and Saffron", "description": "This Mediterranean fish stew is more difficult to spell than to prepare, and it is traditionally neither an id\u00e9e fixe nor the centerpiece of a grande bouffe, but a spur-of-the-moment combination of the day's catch. Trying to duplicate the real bouillabaisse is an exercise in frustration, as the traditional combination of fish is not found in American waters. But creating an admirable local version is no more difficult than making clam chowder. Though some will argue that bouillabaisse must contain fish stock, any time you add a few pounds of fish to a simmering stew there is enough fish essence to make stock superfluous. If additional liquid is needed, water will do just fine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, soups and stews", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 382, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "61 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1593 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon olive oil\u00a0", "2 medium onions, roughly chopped\u00a0", "Zest of 2 navel or other oranges\u00a0", "2 teaspoons fennel seeds\u00a0", "Big pinch saffron, optional\u00a0", "1 dried chile, or cayenne to taste\u00a0", "1 28-ounce can of tomatoes, including juice\u00a0", "1 to 1 1/2 pounds monkfish, catfish, or blackfish, cut into 1-inch cubes\u00a0", "3 pounds hard-shell (littleneck) clams, cockles or mussels, well washed\u00a0", "1 to 1 1/2 pounds shrimp or scallops, cut into bite-size pieces if necessary\u00a0", "1 to 1 1/2 pounds cod or other delicate white-fleshed fish, cut into 6 large chunks\u00a0", "1 tablespoon minced garlic\u00a0", "1 cup roughly chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put olive oil in a casserole or large saucepan over medium heat.
