They are made with egg whites for leavening and contain no flour, so they are a great gluten-free alternative. The batter comes together fast, although it will seem like the egg whites can\u2019t possibly provide enough moisture. Just keep stirring with a strong spoon and a very thick batter will quickly materialize.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/03/dining/03COOKFIGHT4/03COOKFIGHT4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "chocolate, pecans, dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 475}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 143, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "87 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/300 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 cup/90 grams dark cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon/6 grams kosher salt", "5 ounces/135 grams 72 percent chocolate, preferably with nibs, chopped", "1 1/2 cups/135 grams chopped, toasted pecans", "4 large egg whites, room temperature", "1/2 cup/100 grams sugar cubes, crushed, for the tops"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
