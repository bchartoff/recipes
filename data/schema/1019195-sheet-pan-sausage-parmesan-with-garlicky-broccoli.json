So the sausage juices can mingle with the tomato sauce and melted cheese, without compromising the roasted garlicky broccoli to serve alongside. You can use hot or sweet Italian sausages here, or a combination \u2013 as long as you can remember which is which for serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/28/dining/28appetite4/28appetite4-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, sausages", "keywords": "broccoli, mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 631}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 517, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1211 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 clove garlic, thinly sliced", "Large pinch crushed red pepper flakes", "1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes", "1 large sprig basil", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 small bunch broccoli (about 12 ounces), cut into 1-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 pounds hot or sweet Italian sausage, pricked all over with a fork", "1/3 cup fresh ricotta", "3 cloves garlic, 2 thinly sliced, 1 finely grated or minced", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup shredded mozzarella", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese", "Chopped basil or parsley, for serving", "Italian bread, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
