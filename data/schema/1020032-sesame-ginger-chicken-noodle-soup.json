{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame-Ginger Chicken Noodle Soup", "description": "This noodle soup is a grown-up riff on an old college favorite: Taiwanese instant ramen. The scent of the simmering, chicken-and-ginger broth conjures vivid memories of late-night instant-noodle snacks. This version has all of the good qualities of the store-bought kind, but it\u2019s richer in flavor thanks to the bone-in chicken breast (bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs would work too). It hits all the comforting notes of a typical chicken noodle soup, brightened by a hint of sesame oil, fresh scallions and a heavy dose of ginger used in the broth and as a garnish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/12/dining/sl-sesame-chicken-soup/sl-sesame-chicken-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken breast, ginger, rice wine, scallion, sesame oil, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 164}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 682, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1665 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, plus more for serving", "2 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "Kosher salt", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, sliced, plus extra julienned ginger, for garnish", "1/4 cup rice cooking wine or any type of white wine", "12 ounces fresh ramen noodles or 8 ounces dried ramen noodles", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "Ground white or black pepper, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons sesame oil in a medium pot over medium.
