{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tamarind Cream Pie", "description": "With its bright, fruity acidity and a bittersweet depth, tamarind makes for an especially complex cream pie that\u2019s a bit like Key lime, but with a molasses-like edge. This is a good dessert to prepare ahead: You can bake and chill the pie up to 3 days ahead, then add the whipped cream and orange zest up to 6 hours before serving. Keep the pie refrigerated until just before you cut it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/dining/19apperex-pie/merlin_153515910_2b07d427-6b14-4eba-bda8-d0812ddc4ffd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "condensed milk, graham cracker crumbs, tamarind, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 142}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 509, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "273 milligrams", "sugarContent": "36 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/170 grams graham cracker crumbs (from about 11 sheets of crackers)", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick), melted", "1 large orange", "4 large egg yolks", "1 (14-ounce/400-gram) can sweetened condensed milk", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters tamarind paste, extract or concentrate (see tip)", "1 to 2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice, to taste (from 1 lemon or lime)", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 tablespoon confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees, and place a rack in the center of the oven.
