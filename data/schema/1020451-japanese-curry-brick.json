{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Japanese Curry Brick", "description": "This recipe for buttery curry brick comes from the cookbook author and teacher Sonoko Sakai, who wanted a homemade alternative to the industrial, store-bought cubes that make the thick, spicy sauce for Japanese curries. Sakai wanted to avoid palm oil, preservatives and artificial ingredients, so her version starts with whole toasted spices, ground into a fine powder and stirred into a gently browned roux of butter and flour. Feel free to play with the spice proportions \u2014 increase the chile powder for a hotter curry or the kombu for more sweetness. No matter how you tweak it, the best part about Sakai\u2019s recipe is that it makes enough for several meals, and you can store the extra curry bricks in the fridge or freezer, so you\u2019re ready to make a curry whenever you like (see the note below for instructions).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/magazine/15mag-eat/15mag-eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "3 large curry bricks (27 small cubes)", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, curries, poultry", "keywords": "butter, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander seeds, flour, mustard seed, orange zest, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 302}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (2-inch) cinnamon stick, pounded into small pieces", "1 dried bay leaf", "1 tablespoon brown mustard seeds", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "1 tablespoon fennel seeds", "1 tablespoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds", "1/2 teaspoon whole cloves", "2 cardamom pods", "1 dried shiitake mushroom, broken into pieces", "1 (1-inch strip) dried kombu, cut into bite-size pieces", "1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns", "1 orange, zested", "1 tablespoon ground turmeric", "1 tablespoon ground ginger", "1 tablespoon sea salt", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams unsalted butter (3 sticks)", "2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet, toast cinnamon, bay leaf, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, cloves and cardamom pods over medium heat, stirring until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
