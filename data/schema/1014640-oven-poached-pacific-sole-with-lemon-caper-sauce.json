{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oven-Poached Pacific Sole With Lemon Caper Sauce", "description": "A fish piccata of sorts, this dish is easy to make and the lemon-caper sauce marries well with delicate varieties like sole, fluke or flounder, as well as more robust fish like swordfish. Start by laying fish fillets out in a baking dish and seasoning them with salt and pepper. Finely chop some shallots and briefly cook them in a skillet before adding wine. Pour the wine and shallots over the fish, cover with foil and bake until opaque and the fish pulls apart easily when gently probed with a fork. Meanwhile, whisk together garlic, capers, lemon juice and olive oil. When the fish emerges from the oven, pour the liquid from the dish back into the skillet to make a pan sauce. Reduce it to about 1/4 cup \u2014 thicker than you may imagine \u2014 stirring all the while. Add the garlic-caper mixture and some chopped parsley, whisk together and serve on top of the fillets, the mild flesh of the fish bathing in the bright, brawny flavors of the sauce.
