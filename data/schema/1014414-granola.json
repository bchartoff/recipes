{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Granola", "description": "This somewhat clumpy granola isn\u2019t too sweet, so you can feel a little virtuous when you snack on it. It is best to eat it soon after baking, while the clumps still hold; they will eventually fall apart once you put the granola in a jar, but there are enough right after you bake it to qualify it as snacking food in addition to breakfast. Don\u2019t stir it when you bake it and when it is done let it cool completely on the baking sheet; that is the trick to clumping. The technique of leaving a \u201cdonut hole\u201d in the middle when you spread the granola on the baking sheet comes from www.brighteyedbaker.com. It helps the granola bake evenly.
