{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Purple Barley Risotto With Cauliflower", "description": "Purple prairie barley is an heirloom grain that originated in Tibet. High in protein, the grain has the chewy texture of regular barley but with a dark purple hue. If you can\u2019t find purple barley, make this delicious risotto with the regular type, preferably whole hulled barley that has not been pearled. (Pearl barley cooks more quickly, but many of the nutrients are lost when it\u2019s pearled.) Whichever you use, cook the barley ahead of time so that the dish doesn\u2019t take too long to make. Purple prairie barley takes about one and a half hours to cook if unsoaked, about one hour if soaked. A cup yields just under 4 cups cooked barley.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/02/23/science/23recipehealth/23recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves four to six", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, one pot", "keywords": "barley, cauliflower, gluten-free, healthy, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 17}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 596, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "102 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "24 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "748 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 small head cauliflower, separated into small florets, then broken into smaller pieces or sliced 1/2 inch thick (about 4 heaped cups)", "1/2 cup fruity red wine, such as a C\u00f4tes du Rhone", "4 cups cooked purple prairie barley (1 cup uncooked) or hulled barley", "2 cups vegetable or chicken stock", "1 cup thawed frozen or fresh peas", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "2 ounces Parmesan, grated (1/2 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil over medium heat in a large, heavy nonstick skillet or saucepan, and add the onion.
