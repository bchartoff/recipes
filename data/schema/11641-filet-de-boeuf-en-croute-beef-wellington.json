Place flour into a food processor. Cut the butter into tablespoon-size pieces and drop one by one into the flour to coat. Pulse about 5 times until butter is finely chopped. Combine the eggs, oil, 1 tablespoon water and the salt and blend with a fork. With the food processor running, pour the egg mixture in and process until dough starts to form. Stop and scrape the sides and bottom. Process just until the dough forms shiny, damp clumps, adding about 1 tablespoon more water if necessary. Turn out onto a work surface and knead lightly to make a smooth ball. Flatten into a 1 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a food-storage bag.
