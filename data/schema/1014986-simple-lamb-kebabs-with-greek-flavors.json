{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Simple Lamb Kebabs With Greek Flavors", "description": "In days gone by, Italian dressing might have been a go-to marinade for lamb. After you soak, say, some lamb skewers in this dressing for a while and then grill them, what you get is grilled lamb with a kind of vague mix of vinegar, oil and faded herb taste. Contrast this with grilling the lamb, then putting it in a bowl and adding an acidic flavor, like lemon juice or vinegar, the oil and whatever herbs you choose. You\u2019ll get the smoothness of the oil, the sharp hit of the acid (in this case, lemon juice), the aroma of the herbs (in this case marjoram) and the sweet meatiness of the lamb, each distinct flavor complementing and reinforcing others.\n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby And Chris Schlesinger"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/21/dining/21JPGRILLING3/21JPGRILLING3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 entree servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "lamb, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 94}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 782, "unsaturatedFatContent": "43 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "65 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "691 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds boneless leg of lamb", "1/4 cup plus 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and pepper to taste", "Juice of 2 lemons", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1/3 cup roughly chopped fresh marjoram"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a fire in your grill; when the coals are covered with gray ash and the temperature is medium high (you can hold your hand 5 inches above the coals for 3 to 4 seconds), you\u2019re ready to cook.
