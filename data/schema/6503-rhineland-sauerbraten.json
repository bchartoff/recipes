And because the moisture tenderizes the meat, even the least expensive cuts gradually take on savory overtones.\u201d She accompanied her article with this luscious sauerbraten, which benefits greatly from larding the meat with bacon or salt pork, and is even better the day after it is prepared.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mimi Sheraton"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT4H45M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "german", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project, sauces and gravies, times classics", "keywords": "bacon, beef, beef rump, carrot, onion, pickling spices, raisins, salt pork, wine vinegar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 53}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 609, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "1096 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 pound rump of beef (top or bottom round can be used but they are not quite as good)", "1/2 pound salt pork for larding", "2 teaspoons salt", "3 cups wine vinegar (approximately)", "3 cups water (approximately)", "1 large onion, sliced", "2 bay leaves", "8 cloves", "8 peppercorns", "1 tablespoon pickling spices", "1 large carrot, scraped and sliced", "4 slices bacon", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 large onions, sliced", "1 bay leaf", "6 cloves", "3 tablespoons flour", "2 tablespoons sugar", "lemon juice to taste", "1/2 cup white raisins, soaked in warm water", "Tomato puree or sour cream (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rump or round of beef should be well larded with thin matchstick strips of bacon or salt pork.
