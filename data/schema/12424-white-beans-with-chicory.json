The authentic dish is a warm pur\u00e9e of skinned dried fava beans, served with cooked greens, usually chicory, a bitter green that is in the same family as escarole. If you are getting big heads of escarole or another hearty bitter lettuce called Batavia in your C.S.A. baskets, use the tough outer leaves for this and save the tender hearts for salads.
