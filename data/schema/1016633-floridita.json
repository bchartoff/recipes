{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Floridita", "description": "The Floridita is a classic daiquiri riff, which takes its name from a bar in Havana. There, a bartender named Constante tinkered with another bartender\u2019s recipe, adding to it a small quantity of maraschino liqueur and a good amount of crushed ice. Since then, many others have played with the formula, and two separate recipes emerged, each with many variations: the Floridita Daiquiri, and the Floridita Cocktail. The Floridita Daiquiri frequently retains the crushed ice; the Floridita Cocktail is often served straight up, as in this recipe, and its tartness is enhanced by the addition of grapefruit juice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/06/magazine/06DRINK_FROZEN_FLORIDITA/06DRINK_FROZEN_FLORIDITA-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 19}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 93, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces white rum (I prefer Brugal)", "Juice of \u00bd lime", "\u00bd ounce fresh grapefruit juice", "\u00bc ounce maraschino liqueur", "1 teaspoon simple syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Shake with ice, and strain into coupe.
