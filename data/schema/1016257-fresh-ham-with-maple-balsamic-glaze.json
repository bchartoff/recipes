{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Ham With Maple-Balsamic Glaze", "description": "Think beyond pink. Here is a recipe for a fresh ham \u2014 uncured, unsmoked, straight from the butcher \u2014 roasted slowly in the oven beneath a shower of salt and pepper, glazed with maple syrup and balsamic vinegar, and finished with a mixture of toasted pecans and candied ginger. It makes for a holiday centerpiece of some distinction, and marvelous sandwiches afterward. Those with access to good pork, free-ranging and fed well, with lots of fat, do not have to brine the meat before cooking. But if you\u2019re picking up a supermarket ham, it is a good bet to do so.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/16/dining/16EASTER_SPAN-recipe/16EASTER_SPAN-recipe-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "ham, maple syrup, pecans, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 347}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1157, "unsaturatedFatContent": "46 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "81 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "73 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "sodiumContent": "838 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 10- to 12-pound butt or shank portion fresh ham, skin on", "4 teaspoons kosher salt", "4 teaspoons ground black pepper", "1 cup maple syrup", "1/2 cup balsamic vinegar", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 cup pecans, toasted", "1/2 cup candied ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
