{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Milk and Honey Cake", "description": "The flavor of this ultrabuttery layer cake, adapted from Odette Williams\u2019s \u201cSimple Cake\u201d (Ten Speed Press, 2019), can be as mild or pronounced as you like, depending on the variety of honey you use. Clover honey will give you something gentle and mellow, while more assertive buckwheat or chestnut honey have more depth. You can serve the cake plain, with dollops of the whipped cream on the side, for a casual gathering, or frost and fill it, adding berries or other fruit, for a more celebratory affair. It makes an excellent birthday cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/dining/03bakingbookrex4/03bakingbookrex4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "berries, butter, buttermilk, honey, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 367}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), at room temperature, plus more for greasing", "2 1/4 cups/290 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk (shake carton before measuring)", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters honey, plus more for whipped cream and serving", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "Fresh berries, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
