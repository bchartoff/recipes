{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Provencal Spice Rub", "description": "This rub from the south of France can be used with lamb or beef, but is particularly delectable with chicken and game. For chicken, marinate two 3-pound chickens, split in half, in the refrigerator for 6 hours. Place the chicken on the grill, skin side down. Cook over hot coals until the skin is charred, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken and cover the grill. Continue cooking slowly until the meat is opaque at the bone, about 20 to 25 minutes. For duck breast, marinate two 10-to-12-ounce breasts in the refrigerator for 6 hours. Grill, skin side down, until charred, about 5 minutes. Turn the breasts and continue grilling until medium-rare, about 3 to 5 additional minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "One cup", "recipeCuisine": "french, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "dry red wine, juniper berries, mint, olive oil, orange, red onion, low-sodium", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 160, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "7 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon juniper berries", "1 whole clove", "1 teaspoon white peppercorns", "1 1/4-inch cinnamon stick", "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "2 teaspoons dried savory", "1 tablespoon dried thyme", "1 red onion, peeled and minced", "2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "1/2 cup fresh mint leaves", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 teaspoon grated orange rind", "1/4 cup red wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grind all dried spices and herbs together in a spice mill or coffee grinder until finely ground.
