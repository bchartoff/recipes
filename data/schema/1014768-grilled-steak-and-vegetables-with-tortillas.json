{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Steak and Vegetables With Tortillas", "description": "Here's an idea: Spend the same $30, or $50 or $100 or $300 on meat that you now spend each week or month, but buy less and buy better. You might compare this to an annual purchase of 20 $5 T-shirts made by child labor versus one of five $20 T-shirts made by better-paid and better-treated workers from organic cotton. Expensive meat from real farms is a more extreme example of this less-is-better policy. Then cook the meat differently than you used to. Take this vague interpretation of fajitas, one that focuses on grilled vegetables and makes beef a supporting player. A pound or so of tender, fatty rib-eye or sirloin goes a long way with this recipe. And it makes a lovely impression if you present it whole before slicing or chopping. You can cook everything in a cast-iron skillet (you will most likely need more than one, or you will have to cook in batches) instead of on a grill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/29/dining/20130529-FLEX-slide-TDCI/20130529-FLEX-slide-TDCI-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "flour tortillas, steak, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 996, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "101 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "18 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "2021 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ears of corn, shucked", "1 avocado, halved and pitted", "8 radishes, trimmed", "1 fairly firm mango, peeled and halved", "4 limes, halved", "1 large zucchini, sliced lengthwise", "2 large bell peppers or poblanos, cored and halved", "1 bunch scallions, trimmed", "1 head romaine lettuce, outer leaves removed, but left whole", "Olive oil", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1 to 1 1/4 pounds rib-eye or strip steak (about an inch thick)", "8 to 12 small flour tortillas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for direct cooking; the heat should be high on one side and medium on the other, with the rack about 4 inches from the flame.
