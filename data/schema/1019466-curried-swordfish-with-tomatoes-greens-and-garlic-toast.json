{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Curried Swordfish With Tomatoes, Greens and Garlic Toast", "description": "For a decade, swordfish was dangerously overfished. Over time, the North Atlantic swordfish stock has been rebuilt, and swordfish caught by American vessels are now sustainably fished. One thing hasn\u2019t changed: Handled incorrectly, swordfish can be tough or dry. Searing, then steaming with the moisture that comes from braising greens and ripe, on-the-vine tomatoes, yields a moist and succulent steak. Make sure to use small grape or cherry tomatoes. When the tomatoes burst, the juices meld with the curry powder and the fat (ghee or oil) for a flavorful, spoonable sauce. Drizzle any extra over garlicky bread with a generous squeeze of lemon. If you don\u2019t have ghee, cook the fish in a mixture of butter and vegetable oil, which will give you all the high-heat flexibility of ghee with the rich, flavorful finish of butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/dining/sc-Curried-Swordfish-With-Tomatoes--Greens-and-Garlic-Toast/sc-Curried-Swordfish-With-Tomatoes--Greens-and-Garlic-Toast-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "curry powder, mustard greens, swordfish, tomatoes, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 193}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 630, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1025 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons ghee or olive oil", "1 tablespoon Madras curry powder", "2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "1 1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "4 (8-ounce) swordfish steaks", "1 small bunch mustard greens or other braising greens, like kale or chard (about 6 ounces), stemmed and torn into big bite-size pieces", "10 ounces\u00a0grape or cherry tomatoes", "1 ciabatta loaf or baguette, sliced", "1 large garlic clove, peeled", "1 lemon, cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the ghee or oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until melted.
