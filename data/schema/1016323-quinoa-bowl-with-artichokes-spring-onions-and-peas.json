{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quinoa Bowl With Artichokes, Spring Onions and Peas", "description": "Lately I\u2019ve been into \u201cbig bowls\u201d \u2014 layered grain and vegetable meals in a bowl \u2014 in a big way. I cook up a pot of grains and let the vegetables I\u2019m finding at the market inspire how I\u2019m going to build the bowl. Spring onions, artichokes and peas are the focus of this seasonal bowl, and there\u2019s a lot happening here as far as flavor goes. The onions and peas are sweet, but roasting also gives the onions a lovely bitter-edged char, as it does for the artichokes. I\u2019m a recent convert to roasted artichokes; you coat them with olive oil after trimming them, and throw them into a hot oven, where the hearts soften while the edges of the leaves crisp and char. The flavors are intense. I hardly want to prepare them any other way. Garlicky yogurt garnishes and moistens the quinoa and vegetables, and brings more lusty flavor to the dish. You can be flexible with big bowls. If you don\u2019t have quinoa in the pantry, use another grain: bulgur, rice, farro. Couscous would also work. If you want more protein, add a poached egg or even some shredded or sliced chicken breast. And if you want to sprinkle a little feta or Parmesan over the top, be my guest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/03/science/08recipehealth/08recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "artichoke, peas, quinoa, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 50}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 565, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "23 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1413 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon, cut in half, plus more lemon juice for drizzling", "4 medium or 2 large artichokes", "1 generous bunch spring onions", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "Salt and pepper", "1 1/2 pounds peas, shelled", "1/4 cup chopped dill, mint or fennel fronds, or a combination", "1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste)", "1 to 1 1/2 cups Greek yogurt or <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/health/nutrition/25recipehealth.html?ref=yogurt\">drained yogurt</a>, to taste", "3 cups cooked quinoa", "Chopped preserved lemon or dukkah, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
