{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Almond Cake", "description": "This exquisite recipe came to The Times in a 2001 article by Amanda Hesser about the first meal her now mother-in-law, Elizabeth Friend, prepared for her. The meal ended with this simple almond cake. Ms. Hesser wrote: \u201cIt had a crust, fragile like a dry leaf, that led to a moist, downy layer of ground almonds and sugar. It was a perfect dessert. And it punctuated one of the great meals of my life.\u201d It's not the prettiest cake in the world \u2013 Ms. Friend called it \u201cthe Shar-Pei of cakes\u201d because it crumbles on the edges and falls in the middle \u2013 but it is flawless otherwise. If you care about looks, dust it with confectioners\u2019 sugar and top it with fresh berries as we've done in the picture. It also improves with age and can be made 1 to 2 weeks ahead. Store it covered in or out of the fridge. Finally, this recipe makes two 8-inch cakes, so give one away or freeze one for a rainy day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/dining/20COOKING-ALMOND-CAKE1/20COOKING-ALMOND-CAKE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "2 8-inch cakes, 8 servings each", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "almond extract, butter, flour, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 507}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 661, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "326 milligrams", "sugarContent": "49 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 sticks butter, softened, more for buttering pan", "2 cups sifted all-purpose flour (measured after sifting)", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar", "7-ounce tube almond paste", "4 egg yolks, room temperature", "1 teaspoon almond extract", "1 cup sour cream", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for sifting over cake"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
