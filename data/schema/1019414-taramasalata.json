{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Taramasalata", "description": "While this is a sturdy and reliable recipe for making the greek cod roe spread called taramasalata from scratch, funnily enough it doesn't call for cod roe. I've come to prefer the commonly available and affordable salmon roe instead. If you are putting together a greek meze plate \u2014 with feta and kalamata olives, some marinated octopus and skordalia \u2014 save the brine from the feta and use it to season the taramasalata instead of lemon juice and see what you think. It lends a great acidity. Be sure to take the extra step of grating the cooked potato instead of more conveniently throwing it into the food processor and whizzing \u2014 to avoid a gluey texture. It'll keep in the fridge for a week and can be used a few ways all summer \u2014 add a grated white onion and toss with shaved celery and diced tomatoes as a salad dressing. Or thin with a little of the potato cooking water and some good olive oil and consider it as a sauce for whole grilled fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/15/magazine/15mag-Eat-image3/15mag-Eat-image3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "A generous 3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "panko, potato, salmon roe", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 101}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 233, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "76 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces salmon roe", "Juice of 1/2 to 1 lemon", "1 clove garlic peeled", "8 ounces panko soaked in water and squeezed", "Olive oil", "8 ounces peeled, boiled Yukon Gold potato (about 2 medium potatoes)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place roe in the food processor with lemon juice.
