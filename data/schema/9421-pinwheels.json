Gather all leftover scraps of pie dough into a ball. Add a couple drops of cold water to moisten the dough. Flatten the dough and roll into a rectangle, as thin as for pie crust. Moisten the perimeter with a little cold water and sprinkle the entire area with cinnamon-sugar. Roll the dough up tightly lengthwise into a long cylinder. Pinch the seam closed. Slice into rondelles about 1/2 to 1-inch wide and place them on a cookie sheet. Bake for 15 minutes until they are just golden."}]}
