The general consensus is something crisp, salty and delicious. (In France, Champagne with potato chips is considered the perfect pairing.) Cheese wafers and cheese straws are always crowd pleasers. They\u2019re easy to prepare\u2014basically, it\u2019s flaky pastry dough with grated cheese mixed in\u2014and variations are endless. Use Cheddar, Parmesan or whatever cheese suits your fancy. Add rosemary, black pepper, smoky paprika or cumin seeds. Make several kinds in different shapes. With a little extra effort, you can even make savory palmier-style hearts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/21/dining/21KITCH1_SPAN/21KITCH6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 7 dozen, depending on shape", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butter, cheddar, cheese, parmesan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 123}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 41, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "21 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/280 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams kosher salt", "1/2 pound/227 grams cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut in 1/4-inch pieces", "4 ounces/110 grams coarsely grated cheese (Cheddar, Gouda, Gruy\u00e8re or Parmesan), plus more for sprinkling", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters cold milk", "2 egg yolks mixed with 2 tablespoons/30 milliliters cream for egg wash, or 1 whole egg beaten", "Flaky salt, for sprinkling", "Cumin seeds, black pepper, rosemary or smoked paprika, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put flour and salt in mixing bowl.
