Like the shoulders of pigs and cows, it is a hardworking muscle rippled with intramuscular fat, which makes it ideal for stewing or braising. But the shoulder\u2019s not that hardworking, which keeps it tender enough to be subjected to the shorter blasts of heat typically reserved for more elegant cuts. Here, it's braised in a flavorful mixture of prunes, red wine and spices until tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/08/dining/Braised-Lamb-With-Red-Wine/Braised-Lamb-With-Red-Wine-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch", "keywords": "lamb shoulder, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 779}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 537, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "652 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds lamb shoulder", "1 cup pitted prunes", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "Salt and pepper", "1 chopped onion", "2 teaspoons minced ginger", "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon", "1 1/2 cup red wine", "1/2 cup stock or water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut lamb into 2-inch cubes.
