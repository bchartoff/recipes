{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Mushrooms With Gremolata and Quinoa", "description": "When I discovered how delicious Brussels sprouts are when the edges are lightly browned, whether by pan-roasting or oven-roasting, they became a top winter vegetable in my house. Both the Brussels sprouts and the mushrooms roast quickly in a hot oven. I roast them separately so that the juice from the mushrooms doesn\u2019t prevent the Brussels sprouts from browning properly. You can serve the roasted vegetables with quinoa but I also love them with polenta, pasta and other grains.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/04/science/06recipehealth/06recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 277}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 214, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "557 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half if small, quartered if large", "1 pound mushrooms or oyster mushrooms, halved if small, quartered if large", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 to 2 garlic cloves, finely minced", "1/4 cup finely minced flat-leaf parsley", "2 teaspoons finely chopped lemon zest", "2 to 3 cups cooked quinoa (to taste)", "Crumbled feta or goat cheese for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
