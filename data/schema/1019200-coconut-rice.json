To make it, simply replace half of the cooking water with coconut milk. It becomes a meal if you serve it with a fried egg, finely sliced pickled chiles with a little of their pickling liquid and some crushed peanuts. And if you wanted to turn it into dessert, serving it with ripe fruit like cut mango on top, you could stick to the recipe below, but bump the sugar up to 2 tablespoons.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/21/dining/00RICEGUIDE9/00RICEGUIDE9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian, indonesian, malaysian, thai", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "coconut milk, rice, dairy-free, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 564}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 96, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "243 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup long-grain white rice, such as jasmine", "3/4 cup coconut milk", "1 scant tablespoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "3/4 cup water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the rice a few times, until the water that drains away runs almost completely clear."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put in a medium, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat with coconut milk, water, sugar and salt.
