{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Trini Chana and Aloo", "description": "This savory, herbal Trinidadian chickpea-and-potato curry is an island adaptation of a common north Indian dish. It comes from the Trini cooking teacher Dolly Sirju, who dislikes comparisons of Trinidadian food to Indian. \u201cIndia is totally different than Trinidad,\u201d she says. This dish swaps out tomatoes, ginger and whole spices for Madras curry powder and waves of cilantro-like flavor. Serve it with steamed white rice or roti flatbread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Francis Lam"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/04/magazine/04eat/04mag-04eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, curries", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 258}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "275 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound dried chickpeas, soaked overnight in 4 cups of water", "1 1/2 ounces culantro (1 packed cup),(*see note) plus more for garnish", "Kosher salt", "3 fat cloves garlic, smashed", "1/4 to 1 habanero chile, to taste", "1 large russet potato", "1/4 cup vegetable oil", "2 1/2 tablespoons Madras curry powder", "1/2 tablespoon ground turmeric"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium Dutch oven or heavy soup pot, add water to cover the chickpeas by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over high heat, skimming the foam, then lower to a simmer.
