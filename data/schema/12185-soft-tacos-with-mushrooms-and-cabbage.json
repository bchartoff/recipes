Mushrooms are an excellent source of vitamins and many minerals, particularly selenium, copper, potassium, phosphorous, zinc, and manganese \u2013 and they contain a powerful antioxidant called L-ergothioneine. They're used medicinally throughout Asia for their immunity-boosting properties. They also contain more protein than most other vegetables, and their meaty texture makes them a perfect choice for vegetarians. Cabbage possesses phytochemicals like sulforaphane, which protects the body against cancer-causing free radicals, and indoles, which help metabolize estrogens. It\u2019s also an excellent source of vitamins K and C, and a very good source of  dietary fiber, vitamin B6, folate, manganese and omega-3 fatty acids.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/20/science/22recipehealth/22recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "cabbage, mushroom, tortilla, dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 225}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 226, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "929 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 pound mushrooms, cut in thick slices", "1 bunch scallions, white and light green parts, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 small head cabbage", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "1/4 to 1/2 cup Chipotle Ranchera Salsa", "8 corn tortillas", "Queso fresco to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil.
