{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rainbow Quinoa Salad With Fava Beans and Herbs", "description": "Each of the three varieties of quinoa in rainbow quinoa -- red, black and blond \u2013 has a different texture, which is one of the things I like about the blend. The black grains are the hardest and never splay, and the red grains are harder than the white grains. The mixture takes about 5 minutes longer to cook than blond quinoa alone. I like to toast the grains in a hot pan first, for a richer flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/12/health/12recipehealth/12recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fava beans, parsley, quinoa, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 324, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "663 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup rainbow quinoa", "2 cups water", "Salt to taste", "2 pounds fava beans", "1/2 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill", "2 tablespoons chopped chives", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or Champagne vinegar", "1 small garlic clove, pur\u00e9ed", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons grapeseed oil", "Small leaves romaine lettuce, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the quinoa in a strainer and rinse several times with cold water.

Hold several beans in one hand and use your other thumb and forefinger to pinch off the eyes; have a bowl for the shelled favas close at hand, and this will not take a very long time."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Transfer the quinoa to a large bowl.
