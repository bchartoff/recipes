It\u2019s an easy dough to put together. It\u2019s a great vehicle for all kinds of vegetables, just as pizza is. Three variations on the flour mix follow the recipe; you can use more whole-wheat flour or less than is called for in this recipe, which uses half whole-wheat and half all-purpose. When I use Community Grains whole-wheat flour, a California flour made from ancient strains of wheat that is milled in such a way that it is very fine but retains all of its nutrients, I can get away with using a lot. Coarser whole-wheat flours are best used in combination with all-purpose.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/14/science/13recipehealth2/13recipehealth2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "1 large focaccia or 2 smaller focacce, 12 to 15 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "appetizer, dairy-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 55}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons (8 grams) active dry yeast", "1 teaspoon (5 grams) sugar", "1 1/2 cups (340 grams) lukewarm water", "2 tablespoons (25 grams) olive oil, plus 1 to 2 tablespoons (25 grams) for drizzling", "250 grams (approximately 2 cups) whole-wheat flour", "200 to 220 grams (approximately 1 2/3 to 1 3/4 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour or bread flour, plus additional as needed for kneading", "1 3/4 teaspoons (13 grams) salt", "Coarse sea salt", "2 to 4 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary, thyme or sage", "Pitted black olives", "Roasted red peppers, diced or sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a standing mixer, or in a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water.
