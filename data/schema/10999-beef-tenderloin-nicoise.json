{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef Tenderloin Ni\u00e7oise", "description": "It is human nature to want to spend money on food for an important occasion. It is not necessary, but we still do it. And every now and again, that feels good. A beautiful fillet or tenderloin of beef is something special: Even those who do not cook know that. The joy is that these cuts are simple to prepare, needing nothing except to be roasted, rested and sliced. The accompanying vegetables are not served in great heaping bowls on the table, but are chopped and added as an abundant garnish to the welcoming platter of meat. I have called this style ni\u00e7oise because the components \u2013 potatoes, tomatoes, olives and beans \u2013 take their inspiration from that traditional stalwart, the salade ni\u00e7oise.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/16/dining/16COOKING-BEEF-NICOISE1/16COOKING-BEEF-NICOISE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch", "keywords": "beef tenderloin, haricot vert, potato, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 136}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 756, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "891 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 beef tenderloin, about 4 1/2 pounds", "1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "Sea salt", "8 egg-size new potatoes, peeled", "Extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup haricots verts or other fine green beans, in 1-inch lengths", "3 ripe plum tomatoes", "Pinch of sugar", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup pitted black olives, halved", "1/4 cup basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
