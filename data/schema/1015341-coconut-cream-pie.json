Using a food processor or pastry cutter, blend butter and shortening into the flour mixture until pea-sized pieces form. Slowly add the water until the dough just comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, flatten into a disk, and refrigerate for at least one hour. Roll out chilled dough on a floured surface until it is large enough to create a 1-inch overhang on a 9-inch pie pan. Using a fork, poke several holes along the base of the crust. Finish the rim of the crust to your liking and chill until firm, 30 minutes. Line with parchment paper and pie weights. Bake until the edges are pale golden and the crust will hold its shape, 25-30 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment and weights and bake until the crust is dry and pale golden, 5-10 more minutes. Remove from oven and cool."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the filling: Decrease oven temperature to 325 degrees. Pour evaporated milk, cream and sugar into a saucepan. Over medium heat, bring to a boil, then immediately remove from heat. Using a whisk attachment on an electric mixer, beat egg yolks until they appear pale and fluffy. Add cornstarch and butter; continue beating until they are fully incorporated. Add vanilla, coconut extract and cream of coconut. Set the mixer on a low speed and slowly add the warm cream mixture to the egg mixture. Pour the filling back into the saucepan and cook over low heat for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until the custard has thickened to the consistency of runny yogurt. Pour coconut filling into the baked pie shell and bake until the edges are barely puffed and the center wobbles like Jell-o when you give the pan a shuffle, about 20 minutes.
