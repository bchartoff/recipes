{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Duck With Cherries and Red Wine Vinegar", "description": "Classic French duck dishes, like Caneton aux C\u00e9rises (roast duckling with cherries) are for the most part considered too formal or just old-fashioned, relics from a bygone era. An updated version, however, can have great appeal. This interpretation uses a pan-roasted large Muscovy duck breast instead of a whole bird, as easy to cook as a steak. A pungent spice rub imbues it with big flavor. The sauce maintains some classic elements, like red wine vinegar and caramelized sugar, for a sweet-sour aspect, but fresh ginger and cayenne are added for more dimension and spark. Note: Muscovy breasts are quite lean and are best cooked rare to medium-rare (rosy); otherwise the meat will be dry.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/04/dining/04KITCH1/04KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "cherries, duck, red wine vinegar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 150}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 230, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "661 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 Muscovy duck breasts, about 1 pound each", "Kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "1/2 teaspoon allspice berries", "4 cloves", "2 bay leaves", "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds", "1/4 cup turbinado or raw sugar", "1/2 cup red wine vinegar", "1/2 cup red wine", "1 cup chicken broth", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "Pinch of cayenne", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons butter", "1/2 pound ripe cherries, left whole or halved and pitted", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon kirsch or Cognac"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim excess fat from duck breasts, leaving a 1/4-inch layer covering the breast.
