{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pear Crumb Cake", "description": "When it comes to crumb cake, the cake itself is often an afterthought, with all the attention going to the moist brown-sugar crumbles on top. Not so here. This recipe, based on a sour cream pound cake, has a velvety texture and buttery flavor that\u2019s good enough to stand on its own. Of course, the thick pile of large crumbs only sweetens the deal, as does the juicy layer of honey and lemon-spiked pears in between the cake and crumbs.  You can bake this cake a day or two ahead; keep it loosely wrapped at room temperature (the refrigerator will make the crumbs soggy). And if you don\u2019t like pears, feel free to substitute about a cup of any gently cooked fruit you do like \u2013 apples, fuyu persimmon, pineapple, blueberries, grapes, even leftover cranberry sauce \u2013 will all work nicely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/26/dining/26BRING/26SUPERREEF-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack, cakes", "keywords": "dessert, pear", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 352}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon/14 grams unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters honey", "2 small or 1 1/2 large pears, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "Pinch of salt", "1 1/3 cups/165 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/65 grams dark brown sugar, lightly packed", "1/3 cup/65 grams light brown sugar, lightly packed", "1 teaspoon/8 grams ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon/2 grams ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon/1 gram fine sea salt", "1 stick/113 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/133 milliliters sour cream", "3 large eggs", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon/3 grams baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon/2 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams fine sea salt", "1 stick/113 grams softened unsalted butter, cut into pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
