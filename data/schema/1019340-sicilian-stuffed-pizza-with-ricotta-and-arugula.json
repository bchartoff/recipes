{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sicilian Stuffed Pizza With Ricotta and Arugula", "description": "At a pizzeria in the small Sicilian town of Vallelunga-Pratameno, about a couple of hours' drive from Palermo, you could get nearly any kind of pizza, but the house specialty didn\u2019t look like a pizza at all. To make it, the dough was stretched as usual, then slid naked, with no toppings, onto to the oven\u2019s stone floor. In no time at all, the dough began to puff up until nearly spherical, like a giant pita bread. It was taken from the oven, split open and filled with fresh local sheep\u2019s milk ricotta and a large handful of arugula. To serve, it was cut into wedges, like a heavenly sandwich. My version includes a few anchovies and strips of roasted pepper, but even without them, it is delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/06/dining/06kitchenrex/06kitchenrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "anchovies, pecorino, pizza dough, sweet pepper, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 91}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "772 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Fine semolina, for dusting", "8 ounces pizza dough (store-bought or homemade), rolled in a ball and held at room temperature (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017931-pizza-dough\">see recipe</a>)", "8 ounces very fresh ricotta, drained", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "6 to 8 anchovy fillets, rinsed and blotted", "A few strips of roasted sweet pepper", "A few basil leaves", "Salt and pepper", "Crushed red-pepper flakes", "1/4 cup grated aged pecorino cheese, such as pepato", "2 large handfuls arugula, preferably not too tender"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn oven to 450 degrees and put a pizza stone on the middle shelf to heat for 20 to 30 minutes.
