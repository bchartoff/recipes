{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ash-Roasted Potatoes", "description": "You don\u2019t need a real recipe for these potatoes, but you do need a charcoal grill because these ash-baked tubers won\u2019t work with gas. The recipe is a throwback to when clans of kids roamed New York City streets in the early 20th century, building fires in abandoned lots and baking potatoes into the ashes for a hot snack. The potatoes turn so sooty black that it can be hard to tell them apart from the coals, especially in the twilight. The timing of when they will be done will vary depending upon the size of your potatoes and the heat of your fire. Stab them with a skewer to see when they are tender within. To eat, carefully break a potato open and scoop out the smoky, fluffy flesh with a spoon, seasoning it with salt and butter to taste. Or go old-school and wrap the potatoes in a newspaper to protect your fingers before breaking them open and biting the flesh directly from the burned shells.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/01/dining/01APPE_INLINE/01APPE_INLINE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 55}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 164, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "13 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 potatoes, any kind (or use as many as you like)", "Butter, for serving", "Salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a large and very hot charcoal fire.
