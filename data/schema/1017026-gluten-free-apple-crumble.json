{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gluten-Free Apple Crumble", "description": "In this unusual recipe by Alice Medrich, adapted from her gluten-free cookbook \"Flavor Flours\" (Artisan 2014), a combination of white rice flour and oat flour make for an apple crumble with a distinct crunch and butterscotch-like flavor. Ms. Medrich also uses an interesting technique with the apples, baking them halfway through before adding the crumble mixture, which keeps the walnuts from becoming too dark. She also doesn\u2019t peel the apples, though you may if you\u2019d rather. If you can\u2019t find oat flour, you can make your own by grinding rolled oats in a food processor or blender until powdery.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/03/dining/03BOOK_FOOD4/03BOOK_FOOD4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, pies and tarts", "keywords": "apple, unsalted butter, walnuts, white rice flour, dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 90}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 392, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "80 milligrams", "sugarContent": "40 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds/900 grams apples, diced into 3/4-inch pieces", "2 to 3 tablespoons/ 30 to 45 milliliters lemon juice, to taste", "2 tablespoons/25 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon/10 grams white rice flour", "1 cup/100 grams finely chopped walnuts", "1/2 cup/100 grams firmly packed light brown sugar", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2/3 cup/100 grams white rice flour", "1/4 cup/25 grams oat flour", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 1/4 teaspoons/9 grams ground cinnamon", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
