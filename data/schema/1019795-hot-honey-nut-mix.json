Serve them next to olives and cheese at a party, keep a stash in your tote or office snack drawer, or tie a bag of them up with a bow.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/27/dining/as-hot-honey-nuts/as-hot-honey-nuts-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, honey, nuts, seeds, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 304, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "137 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups unsalted, roasted whole nuts (such as cashews, pecans, pistachios or a mix)", "1 cup seeds (such as pumpkin, sesame, millet, quinoa, sunflower, nigella or a mix)", "1/4 cup honey", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter\u00a0or coconut oil", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon turbinado sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
