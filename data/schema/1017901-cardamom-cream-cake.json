{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cardamom Cream Cake", "description": "Layer cakes are always festive, particularly when they are four-layered, fluffy and cloudlike. This one, based on the flavors of an Indian dessert called ras malai, combines rose water, ricotta cheese and cardamom. Egg whites in the batter and mascarpone in the buttercream give the cake an especially ethereal texture, while a cardamom-infused milk syrup keeps it moist. Make sure to use cold, straight-from-the fridge mascarpone and yogurt for the frosting; it can curdle if you try to beat it when the ingredients are too warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/23/multimedia/clark-cardamom-cake/clark-cardamom-cake-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cake flour, cardamom, heavy cream, mascarpone, ricotta, rose water, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 405}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds/680 grams fresh whole-milk ricotta (2 1/2 cups)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream", "3/4 cup/95 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar (see tip)", "1 teaspoon rose water, or to taste", "2 cups/475 milliliters whole milk", "4 cardamom pods", "6 tablespoons/75 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons rose water, or to taste", "12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter, softened (1 1/2 sticks), more for greasing pan", "3 cups/330 grams cake flour, more for flouring pan", "4 large egg whites", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon rose water", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon/20 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter, softened (1 1/2 sticks)", "1 cup/125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 teaspoon rose water, or to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 cup/240 milliliters cold mascarpone", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters cold Greek yogurt", "1/3 cup/50 grams pistachios, toasted and chopped", "Candied rose petals, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain the ricotta in a fine mesh sieve placed in a large bowl for 1 to 2 hours until very thick.
