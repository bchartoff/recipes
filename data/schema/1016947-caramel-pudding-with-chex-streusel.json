But jobs cooking burgers in turn-and-burn dives led to high-end ski resorts, and then culinary school. Now he\u2019s among a few chefs who are cracking the code of how to make Utah restaurants individual, seasonal and profitable. (Working against 100-mile-an-hour wind gusts and the state\u2019s labyrinthine liquor laws isn\u2019t easy.)\n\nHandle, which opened in Park City in September, is his first restaurant as chef and owner, but he knows the local palate backwards and forwards. \u201cPudding always sells,\u201d he said. Pudding, like Jell-O (Utah\u2019s official state snack) is a staple at Mormon gatherings, where sugar is a favorite indulgence. (Alcohol and nicotine are forbidden by the church.) His sneaky and delicious twist on butterscotch pudding has a breath of whiskey from the High West Distillery across the street; you may leave it out. The Chex streusel brings back every Thanksgiving Day, as he snacked endlessly on bowls of Chex Mix while watching football.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19UTAH/19UTAH-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, custards and puddings", "keywords": "chex cereal, heavy cream, whiskey, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 71}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 731, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "sodiumContent": "529 milligrams", "sugarContent": "53 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/220 grams brown sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters corn syrup", "3 cups/720 milliliters heavy cream", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters whole milk", "1 vanilla bean, halved and seeds scraped", "1 large egg, plus 3 large yolks", "5 tablespoons/40 grams cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon salt, more to taste", "5 tablespoons/70 grams butter, cubed", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters whiskey, preferably High West Double Rye (optional)", "1/4 box/85 grams Chex cereal", "1/2 cup/110 grams brown sugar", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/2 cup/63 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon/1 gram ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon/3 milliliters vanilla extract", "Salt and freshly grated nutmeg, to taste", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 cup/226 grams mascarpone cheese", "1 cup/240 milliliters maple syrup", "Sea salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the budino: Combine brown sugar, corn syrup and 2 tablespoons water in a large heavy pot.
