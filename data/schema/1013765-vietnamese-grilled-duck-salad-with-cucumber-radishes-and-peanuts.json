{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vietnamese Grilled Duck Salad With Cucumber, Radishes and Peanuts", "description": "This zesty, cool and satisfying dish is worth making on any steamy summer night. The duck (you could use flank steak in a pinch, or for value) is marinated in a Vietnamese-inspired combination of soy sauce, lime, ginger, garlic, rice wine vinegar and fish sauce. The meat is grilled over indirect heat, and the result is meat beautifully infused with the flavors of the marinade.  A crunchy slaw of cucumbers, radishes and carrots strewn with herbs and roasted peanuts finishes off the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/dining/25COOKINGweb2/25COOKINGweb2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, salads and dressings", "keywords": "carrot, cucumber, duck breast, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 41}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 491, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "2127 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup soy sauce", "3 limes", "2 tablespoons grated ginger", "2 teaspoons toasted (Asian) sesame oil", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "4 duck breast halves 2 1/2 pounds, rinsed and patted dry", "2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar", "2 teaspoons Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce", "3 small jalape\u00f1os, seeded", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive or peanut oil", "Kosher salt", "black pepper", "1 large cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced", "2 large carrots, peeled and coarsely grated", "1/3 pound radishes, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro, plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup chopped mint, plus more for garnish", "1/3 cup chopped salted roasted peanuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together 1/4 cup soy sauce, juice and zest of 1 lime, ginger, and sesame oil.
