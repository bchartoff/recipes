Even bars in Cuba, the drink\u2019s homeland, play pretty fast and loose with daiquiri variations. The lime shortage of 2014 inspired me to try it with lemon instead, and the result is bracing and a little disorienting (in a good way) \u2014 like a union between a traditional daiquiri and a Tom Collins. And I like what the distinctive funkiness of rhum agricole adds to the drink. Swap in different fresh, seasonal citrus juices whenever the mood strikes (but adjust the amount of simple syrup accordingly, as other fruits are inherently sweeter than lemons). I\u2019m thinking a daiquiri with clementine juice will hit the spot come winter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/06/magazine/06drink/06drink-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces rhum agricole blanc (like Neisson)", "1 ounce fresh lemon juice", "\u00bd ounce simple syrup", "Lemon verbena for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Shake all ingredients except lemon verbena with ice, and strain into a cocktail glass."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Garnish with verbena."}]}
