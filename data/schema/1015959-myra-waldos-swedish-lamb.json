Mr. Claiborne recommended this one in a column in the newspaper four years later: a leg of lamb roasted above carrots and onions, broth, hot coffee, cream and a sprinkling of sugar. Really! The result on the plate is remarkable in the way the richness of the sauce mingles with the big taste of the lamb. All we needed to do to improve it was exchange the beef broth Claiborne used (too tinny in flavor) for some of the low-sodium chicken variety.
