{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Omelet", "description": "This recipe is for a basic French omelet with three eggs: enough for a hearty breakfast or brunch, or a light supper for one. The key to mastering this recipe is controlling the heat so the eggs do not brown, and whisking the eggs in the skillet so they set on the exterior but remain fluffy inside. A good nonstick or well-seasoned carbon-steel skillet is central to cooking the ideal omelet, which should be tender and slightly runny. Once you\u2019ve got the technique down, you can play around with your seasonings, adding minced herbs, grated cheese, diced ham or saut\u00e9ed vegetables.
