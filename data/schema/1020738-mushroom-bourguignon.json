{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom Bourguignon", "description": "Meaty mushrooms simmered with pearl onions, wine and carrots make for a rich, wintry Bourguignon-style stew. The quality of the stock here makes a big difference, so if you\u2019re not using homemade, buy a good brand. If you\u2019re a meat eater, beef broth adds a familiar brawny character to this dish, but mushroom or vegetable broth work just well, especially because the whole dish is rounded out with a tamari for depth. For the best flavor, use as many kinds of mushrooms as you can get, and let them really brown when searing; that caramelization adds a lot of depth to the sauce. Maitake mushrooms give this a brisketlike texture, in a very good way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/dining/31lessmeat2/merlin_166152300_0264611b-15a4-4fee-a6ec-b1849725d790-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "dry red wine, leek, mushroom, pearl onion, fall, winter, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2597}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons butter or extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 pounds mixed mushrooms, such as portobello, cremini, white button, shiitake or oyster, cut into 1-inch chunks (about 10 cups)", "8 ounces peeled pearl onions\u00a0(2 cups), larger ones cut in half", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 large leek or 2 small leeks, white and light green parts, diced (1 1/2 cups)", "2 carrots, thinly sliced", "3 garlic cloves (2 minced, 1 grated to a paste)", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups dry red wine", "1 1/2 cups beef, mushroom or vegetable broth", "1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce, plus more to taste", "3 large fresh thyme branches or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 bay leaf", "3 to 4 ounces chanterelle or oyster mushrooms, thinly sliced (about 1 cup)", "Smoked paprika, for serving", "Polenta, egg noodles or mashed potatoes, for serving", "Chopped flat-leaf parsley, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add 2 tablespoons butter or oil to a large Dutch oven or pot and set it over medium heat.
