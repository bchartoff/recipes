{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butternut Squash and Fondue Pie With Pickled Red Chiles", "description": "Cheese lovers unite: This pie is seriously, intensely cheesy. Raclette is a semihard cheese from the Swiss and French Alps that eats well when melted. If you can\u2019t get your hands on some, replace it with equal amounts of Gruy\u00e8re. The heat and acidity of the pickled chiles help cut through the richness, but a zingy green salad would also pair well here. You can serve this pie warm, but it tastes just as good at room temperature, so it's a perfect bake-ahead option.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/dining/11ottorex/merlin_162292590_04c780eb-bb45-442f-bb67-be365f078a79-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastries, pies and tarts, vegetables", "keywords": "butternut squash, dry white wine, gruy\u00e8re, heavy cream, phyllo, raclette cheese, fall, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 285}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons/65 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar", "1 red serrano chile, very thinly sliced at an angle into rounds, seeds and all", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 small butternut squash (about 1 3/4 pounds/800 grams), peeled, halved, deseeded and cut into 1/2-inch/1 1/2-centimeter-thick half-moons", "1 3/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "3 tablespoons and 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, plus extra for greasing", "1 yellow onion (about 5 ounces/150 grams), peeled and cut into five 1/2-inch/1 1/2-centimeter-thick rounds", "6 garlic cloves, crushed", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters dry white wine", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped, plus 5 extra sprigs", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream (double cream)", "1 large egg plus 2 yolks", "1 tablespoon cornstarch (cornflour)", "4 1/2 ounces/125 grams Gruy\u00e8re, grated (about 1 1/2 lightly packed cups)", "4 ounces/115 grams raclette, grated (about 1 1/3 lightly packed cups)", "7 sheets phyllo (filo) pastry (about 10-by-13 inches/26-by-34 centimeters each, or similar), thawed if frozen"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit/230 degrees Celsius.
