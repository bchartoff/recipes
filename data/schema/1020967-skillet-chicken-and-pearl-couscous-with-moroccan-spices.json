{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken and Pearl Couscous With Moroccan Spices", "description": "This one-pan meal, which is inspired by the tagines of North Africa, is prepared in a deep skillet or Dutch oven instead of the traditional clay pot. Briefly marinate bone-in chicken thighs in lime juice, garlic, cumin and olive oil, then brown and set aside. (If you\u2019re short on time, skip the marinade; simply add the ground cumin when you\u2019re toasting the other spices in the chicken fat.) Stir in harissa, cinnamon and turmeric, toast until fragrant, then add quick-cooking pearl couscous and the chicken, so everything finishes cooking together. Top the finished dish with a fistful of roughly chopped tender herbs and lime zest for a jolt of brightness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/25/dining/ch-moroccan-chicken/merlin_170016399_a730fbd8-51fd-4700-b061-3b3e573076e6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, couscous, cumin, leek, lime, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 thighs)", "1 teaspoon fresh lime zest plus 1/4 cup juice (from 2 limes)", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "3 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "1 large leek, trimmed, rinsed of grit then thinly sliced into rings (about 1 1/2 cups), or 1 medium yellow onion, chopped", "1 tablespoon harissa paste, tomato paste or chile-garlic sauce", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 1/4 cups pearl couscous or orzo", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock", "1/2 cup roughly chopped mixed tender herbs such as parsley, cilantro and mint (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the chicken thighs, lime juice, olive oil, garlic and cumin.
