This is a fine alternative to the packaged stuff. Instead, make the sauce by blending cottage cheese with milk in a food processor. It\u2019s not yellow, but it has that creamy, cheesy taste. Make sure to blend the sauce well so that it won\u2019t be chalky. This is a good sauce for penne or fusilli (though other kinds of pasta will work). You can add vegetables, like broccoli, which really catches the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, casseroles", "keywords": "healthy, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 79}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 269, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "216 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup nonfat or low-fat cottage cheese", "1/4 cup low-fat milk (more as desired)", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus additional for the table", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "3/4 pound pasta (such as penne, fusille, spaghetti, fettucine)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil.
