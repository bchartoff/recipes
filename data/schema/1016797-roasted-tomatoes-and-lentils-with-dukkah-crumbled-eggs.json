{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Tomatoes and Lentils With Dukkah-Crumbled Eggs", "description": "At once homey and inspired, this recipe from Diana Henry lifts stewed lentils out of the quotidian by topping them with harissa-roasted plum tomatoes, runny-centered eggs, and a pungent, Middle Eastern nut-and-spice mix called dukkah. Ms. Henry calls for making the dukkah with a mortar and pestle, which helps maintain a chunky, rustic texture. A food processor works, too, just add the nuts last so they don\u2019t turn into paste, and don\u2019t overdo the processing. You\u2019re looking for coarsely rather than finely ground. You can make the dukkah, lentils and tomatoes a few days ahead. Just heat them up before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/10/dining/10COOKBOOK2/10COOKBOOK2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "dukkah, eggs, hazelnuts, lentils, sesame seeds, tomatoes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 45}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup hazelnuts (skins on)", "1/3 cup sesame seeds", "1 teaspoon nigella seeds", "1 tablespoon sunflower seeds", "3 tablespoons coriander seeds", "1 tablespoon white peppercorns", "1 1/2 tablespoons cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon ground paprika", "1/2 tablespoon sea salt flakes", "12 large plum tomatoes, halved", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 teaspoons store-bought harissa", "1/2 tablespoon sugar", "Salt and black pepper, to taste", "6 extra-large eggs", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1/2 yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 celery stalk, finely chopped", "1 1/3 cups Puy or green lentils", "1 sprig of thyme", "1 bay leaf", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make dukkah, put hazelnuts in a dry skillet and toast over high heat until nuts smell roasted.

Toast coriander seeds until fragrant and coarsely grind. Repeat with peppercorns and cumin seeds. Combine nuts, seeds and toasted spices with the paprika and sea salt.
