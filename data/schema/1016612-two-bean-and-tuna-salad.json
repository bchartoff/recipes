{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Two-Bean and Tuna Salad", "description": "This is the most amazing version of tuna and bean salad I\u2019ve ever tasted. It incorporates crunchy green beans, a red onion made a little milder by soaking in water, tuna and a bean of your choice. I\u2019ve used a lush bean called Good Mother Stallard, which really makes this salad stand out. You can substitute borlotti beans, pinto or white beans. If you\u2019re using canned beans, rinse them first. Whichever bean you choose, you\u2019ll have an amazing light and satisfying meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/01/science/02recipehealth/02recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 Servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low calorie, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 85}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 256, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "457 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound green beans, trimmed", "1 small red onion, cut in half and sliced in half-moons (optional)", "2 5-ounce cans tuna (packed in water or olive oil), drained", "1 1/2 cups cooked Good Mother Stallard, borlotti, pinto or white beans (if using canned beans, rinse)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley", "2 tablespoons chopped chives", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh marjoram or sage", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar", "Salt to taste", "1 garlic clove, minced or pur\u00e9ed", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons bean broth", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium-size pot of water to a boil and add salt to taste.
