{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Risotto With Sausage and Parsley", "description": "This is a very simple if slightly stove-intensive dinner, a two-pot meal that comes together serially to achieve a hearty whole. I use sweet Italian sausage most of the time, but the hot varieties work as well, and always the richest chicken stock available \u2014 sometimes adding bouillon to my homemade stock for the extra oomph it provides. The key is stirring, stirring, stirring the rice as you add the stock, taking care to incorporate each ladleful entirely into the rice before adding more. Taste often at the end, and adjust the seasoning as you like, but do not stint on either the lemon juice or the parsley, as their brightness acts as a terrific foil to the rich, unctuous quality of the rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/21/magazine/21mag-eat1/21mag-21eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "arborio rice, italian sausage, parmesan, white wine, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1153}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 589, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "959 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds sweet or hot Italian sausage", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste", "5 to 6 cups chicken stock, ideally homemade", "1 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large onion, peeled and diced", "1 1/2 cups Arborio rice", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1/2 cup packed and roughly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "1/2 of 1 lemon", "1/2 cup finely chopped Italian parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "With the tip of a small, sharp knife, slit open the sausage casings.
