{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet and Spicy Grilled Chicken Breasts", "description": "Brown sugar gives these grilled chicken breasts a glistening glaze and caramel-like sweetness, while mustard powder and cayenne add an earthy kick. If you don\u2019t want to bother making a mustard sauce for dipping, just serve these with dollops of good, strong Dijon mustard on the side. A crisp salad and some grilled corn completes the meal. And if you prefer dark meat, this recipe will also work with boneless, skinless thighs, though you might have to add a minute or so to the cooking time. Or use a combination of breasts and thighs for maximum crowd appeal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/22/dining/22GRILLCHIXSWEETSOUR/22GRILLCHIXSWEETSOUR-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "barbecue", "recipeCategory": "barbecues", "keywords": "chicken breast, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1007}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 282, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "458 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts", "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard powder", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne", "1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "4 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "2 teaspoons minced fresh chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place chicken breasts between two sheets of parchment or plastic wrap.
