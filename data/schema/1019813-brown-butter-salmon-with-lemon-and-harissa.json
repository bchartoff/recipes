{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown-Butter Salmon With Lemon and Harissa", "description": "More put-together than thrown-together, this weeknight salmon gets an upgrade with a tangy and spicy brown butter-harissa sauce. To make it a complete meal, serve the fish with a simple lemony salad and maybe a bowl of grains or roasted or boiled potatoes. This salmon is meant to be enjoyed on the medium-rare side. If you prefer your fish more well done (or if the fillet is especially thick), increase cooking time by a few minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/12/dining/12romanrex1/merlin_143108520_28482b08-47be-4f5a-aa4c-5fc56d261efe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, seafood", "keywords": "dill, harissa, lettuce, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 440}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 545, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "717 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds skin-on salmon fillet (or use 1 1/2 pounds of individual fillets)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 garlic cloves, sliced", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons harissa paste", "4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more for serving", "1 small shallot, thinly sliced into rings", "2 heads Little Gem lettuce or 1 head butter lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces", "1/4 cup dill leaves, finely chopped, plus more for serving", "4 thick slices of country bread, toasted, or boiled potatoes (optional)", "Aioli or mayonnaise (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
