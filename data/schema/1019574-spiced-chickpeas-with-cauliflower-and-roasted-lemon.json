{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Chickpeas With Cauliflower and Roasted Lemon", "description": "In this hearty, meatless main course, chickpeas and potatoes are coated in a tomato-tinged spice paste and roasted until crunchy and browned. At the same time and in the same oven, cauliflower and tomatoes are cooked along with thinly sliced lemons until soft and caramelized. Just before serving, everything is tossed altogether and drizzled with an herbed, garlicky yogurt sauce. It\u2019s a complete and satisfying meal that\u2019s perfect for vegetable lovers.\u00a0Meyer lemons work particularly well\u00a0here\u00a0because they are milder and sweeter than regular lemons. But use whichever you can find.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/dining/26apperex2/26apperex2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "cauliflower, chickpea, dill, potato, yogurt, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 717}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 595, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "16 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1493 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt, as needed", "1 lemon, preferably a Meyer lemon, thinly sliced and seeded", "1 (2 1/4-pound) head of cauliflower, cut into bite-size pieces (about 8 cups)", "1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved", "2 jalape\u00f1os, seeded and thinly sliced", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon tomato paste", "1/2 teaspoon Tabasco or other hot sauce", "3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 (14- to 16-ounce)\u00a0can chickpeas, drained and blotted dry", "1 pound baby or fingerling potatoes, cut into quarters", "2 rosemary sprigs", "3/4 cup plain whole-milk yogurt (or substitute soy, nut or coconut milk yogurt)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh dill or mint, plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup chopped fresh basil, plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup chopped parsley, plus more for garnish", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "Fresh lemon juice, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position racks in the top and bottom thirds of oven and heat to 425 degrees.
