{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Catalan Stew With Lobster and Clams", "description": "Romesco, the delicious rust-colored sauce from the Catalan region of Spain, is justly popular, served alongside grilled fish or as dip for vegetables. It is typically made with fresh and dried red peppers, roasted almonds and hazelnuts, a fair amount of garlic, and day-old bread fried in olive oil. Sometimes, however, instead of being used as a sauce, it is added to a fish stew. Known as romesco de peix or simply romescada, it may contain several kinds of fish and shellfish. In this version, which features lobster and clams, rather than stirring in the romesco at the end, the ingredients are added in stages from the beginning, for depth of flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/17/dining/17KITCHEN1/KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "clams, hazelnut, lobster, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 311}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 396, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "46 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1191 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 lobsters, about 1 1/2 pounds each", "1/4 cup whole almonds", "1/4 cup hazelnuts", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 slices day-old bread from a large French or Italian loaf, crusts removed", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "Salt and pepper", "2 dried \u00f1ora chiles or 1 dried ancho chile, stems and seeds removed", "1 fresh red Fresno chile, seeds removed and finely chopped", "3 canned piquillo peppers, chopped (optional)", "1 teaspoon piment\u00f3n dulce (sweet Spanish paprika)", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 cup fresh or canned tomato pur\u00e9e", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "12 littleneck clams or 24 manila clams, rinsed", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Boil or steam lobsters for 10 minutes, then rinse with cool water.
