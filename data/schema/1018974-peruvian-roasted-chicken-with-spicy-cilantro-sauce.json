{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peruvian Roasted Chicken With Spicy Cilantro Sauce", "description": "Burnished-skinned, deeply flavored and more than just a little spicy, it\u2019s no wonder that Peruvian chicken has become something of an obsession here in the United States. There are dozens of way to make this dish, but most recipes call for two different kinds of Peruvian chile pastes \u2014 aji amarilla and aji panca \u2014 to add the necessary complexity and heat. You can find them at South American markets and online. But in a pinch, you can substitute a red chile paste (like sriracha or sambal) for the aji amarillo, and ground pasilla chile powder for the aji panca. The flavors won\u2019t be traditional, but the chicken will still be tasty \u2014 especially when slathered with the irresistibly creamy, spicy cilantro sauce that goes alongside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/dining/mc-peruvian-chicken/merlin_146806653_43c09c3c-dcc6-42b6-ac62-409d4bde8577-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "aji amarillo paste, chicken, cilantro, lime juice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1737}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon aji amarillo paste or another chile paste such as sriracha or sambal", "1 tablespoon lime juice", "1 teaspoon aji panca paste or 1 teaspoon pasilla chile powder", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 (3 1/2- to 4 1/2-pound) chicken, halved (see Note) or 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed", "1 cup cilantro leaves and tender stems", "3 to 4 jalape\u00f1os, seeded and diced", "1/4 cup/1 ounce crumbled feta cheese", "1 garlic clove, chopped", "1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice, more to taste", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano or basil", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 tablespoon aji amarillo or other chile paste (see headnote)", "1/2 teaspoon honey", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Lime wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the marinade: In a large bowl, whisk together garlic, soy sauce, aji amarillo paste, lime juice, aji panca paste, mustard, cumin, pepper and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add chicken halves, turning to coat them all over with marinade.
