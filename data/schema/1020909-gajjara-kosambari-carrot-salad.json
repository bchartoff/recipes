If fresh coconut isn\u2019t available, keep a bag of frozen grated coconut in the freezer. It\u2019s easy to find at most Indian grocery stores and, when you have it on hand, you can bring this salad together in less than five minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/11/dining/09Indianrex4/merlin_169211703_f1cf8288-458d-4dba-98c5-e95377e91723-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "snack, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, carrot, coconut, cumin seeds, mustard seed, serrano chili, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1 green finger chile (or serrano chile), halved lengthwise", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1/2 teaspoon white sesame seeds", "1/4 teaspoon black mustard seeds", "1/4 cup moong dal (split green gram), soaked for 1 hour, rinsed and drained (optional)", "3 large carrots, peeled and roughly grated", "2 tablespoons fresh or frozen grated coconut", "Handful of cilantro leaves and tender stems, chopped", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 lemon, for squeezing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small skillet, heat the oil over medium.
