It is similar to risotto, but a bit on the soupy side, and less rich. A flavorful homemade chicken broth is essential. Look for peas that haven\u2019t quite filled their pods \u2014 larger peas will be starchier. Asian markets and some farmers\u2019 markets carry leafy pea tendrils, but any tender greens are fine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/30/dining/30KIT6/KIT-7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "editors' pick", "keywords": "peas, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 67}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 434, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "935 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons butter", "1 medium onion, diced", "1 cup arborio or carnaroli rice", "Salt and pepper", "6 cups hot chicken broth", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "3 ounces pancetta, diced", "6 scallions, chopped", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "12 fresh sage leaves", "8 ounces shucked English peas, about 2 cups", "4 ounces pea tendrils or shoots (or use baby spinach)", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "2 ounces grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in a heavy, wide saucepan over medium high heat.
