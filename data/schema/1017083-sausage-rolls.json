{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sausage Rolls", "description": "Though the concept of sausage wrapped in pastry exists in every cuisine in one way or another, the British have claimed sausage rolls as their own. They are always welcome, especially at holiday time. Boxing Day, a national holiday in Britain, celebrates the traditional post-Christmas servants\u2019 day off, when upper-class families were forced to fend for themselves and subsist for a day on a lavish buffet of leftover feasts from the week. Sausage rolls are often part of the spread.\n\nA pleasantly spiced homemade sausage mixture is easy to make up with a pound or two of ground pork shoulder, not too lean. They are usually made with all-butter puff pastry (often frozen store-bought, a good option); these are wrapped in a very flaky lard and butter pastry. Both the pastry and the sausage filling can be made a day ahead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/24/dining/24KITCHEN1/24KITCHEN1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "24 sausage rolls", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sausages", "keywords": "main course, pork lard, pork shoulder, puff pastry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 357}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 147, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "122 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/250 grams all-purpose flour, more for dusting", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "4 tablespoons/50 grams pork lard", "4 ounces/113 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick), cut in 1/4-inch cubes", "1/2 cup /118 milliliters ice water", "2 pounds/900 grams pork shoulder, not too lean, ground coarse", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Pinch of cayenne", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon mace", "2 teaspoons chopped thyme", "2 tablespoons chopped sage", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley", "1 egg, beaten, for egg wash"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pastry: Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl.
