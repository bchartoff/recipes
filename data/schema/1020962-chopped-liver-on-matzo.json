I do love to eat it, and for those who feel the same way, \"Hello, nice to meet you!\" It\u2019s not much to look at, but at least one of you will become a fan after spreading this funky, savory mixture onto a salted matzo with a sprinkle of parsley and lemon juice. (I\u2019m hoping that person is you.) It won\u2019t keep very long (it\u2019s best within 24 hours), but that\u2019s why this version makes the perfect snackable amount.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/dining/30Roman3/merlin_170266164_e898870d-d5be-44be-8cd6-d5c8e76fc024-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings (about 1 cup)", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken fat, chicken liver, shallot", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 9}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons chicken fat or unsalted butter, melted", "6 ounces chicken livers, rinsed and trimmed of any fat", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 large shallots (about 6 ounces), thinly sliced", "1/4 cup dry white wine or sherry", "Flaky sea salt", "3 tablespoons coarsely chopped parsley", "Matzo, for serving", "1 lemon, halved, for squeezing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 2 tablespoons chicken fat in a medium skillet over high heat.
