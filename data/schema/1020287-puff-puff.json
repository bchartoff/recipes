{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Puff Puff", "description": "The genius of puff puff is in the simplicity of the dough: A nutmeg-spiked batter, a bit of patience for the yeast to rise and time to fry up the balls will result in the most delightful little puffs. If the batter seems wet, you are on the right track. The consistency should be similar to a yeasted pancake or waffle batter. Tossing the fried dough in spiced sugar is optional, but recommended: The added layer creates an irresistible crunch.
