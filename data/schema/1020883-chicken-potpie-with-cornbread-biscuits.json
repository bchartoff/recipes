{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Potpie With Cornbread Biscuits", "description": "A showstopper of a dinner made for cold nights, this spin on classic chicken pot pie is the perfect all-in-one dinner when you\u2019re craving something hearty and comforting. The cornmeal and buttermilk biscuits that bake on top of the filling are the best of both worlds: crisp and flaky on top and soft and dumpling-like on the bottom. A hint of sweetness in the biscuits makes them reminiscent of classic American cornbread. This is not a recipe for rushed weeknights, though you can save time by making the biscuit dough and prepping the vegetables in advance (see Tip).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/18/dining/lh-chicken-pot-pie-with-cornbread-biscuits/merlin_168782391_9928d75a-b895-40ac-8bd7-e5c37404d58d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "buttermilk, carrots, celery, chicken, cornmeal, flour, onion, rosemary, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 57}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (2 breasts)", "Olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 1 1/2 cups)", "4 large celery stalks, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 medium yellow onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)", "2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock", "1/2 cup whole milk", "3 tablespoons dry sherry", "2 tablespoons minced fresh chives or parsley", "1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash", "1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/105 grams yellow cornmeal", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "5 tablespoons/70 grams chilled unsalted butter, diced", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters buttermilk, shaken"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the chicken breasts dry and place them on the prepared sheet pan.
