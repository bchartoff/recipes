{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Warm Tofu and Fresh Soybeans Cooked in Salted French Butter and Celery-Seed Gastrique", "description": "There are three pretty joyful projects here that reward not only the pleasure-driven eater but the scientifically curious mind as well. Making soy milk, making soft tofu, and making a savory caramel sauce (not sweet like the one you're probably accustomed to, but vinegary and spicy) are all as easy as those beginner science projects we remember from grade school (growing marigolds or sprouting avocado pits) and equally as wondrous. As always, ingredients matter. The better the soy, the richer the milk, the richer the milk, the more compelling the tofu. The better the butter, the more expert the finished dish. Each component is quite easy but requires your full attention. Over-soaking the beans can give the curd a pitted texture; over-stirring the coagulant can break up the quickly setting curd and give you cottage cheese texture. And adding the vinegar to the burning sugar can be little hazardous \u2013 that step maybe closer resembles tenth grade chemistry than 1st grade marigold planting, I admit!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/13/magazine/13eat1/13eat1-articleLarge-v2.png", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apple cider vinegar, celery seeds, dried yellow soybeans, tofu coagulant, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried yellow soybeans, any debris removed", "9 1/4 cups filtered water", "2 teaspoons tofu coagulant (Powdered Nigari or Glucono Delta-Lactone)", "1/2 cup sugar", "2 tablespoons water", "1/2 teaspoon celery seed", "1/2 teaspoon crushed chile flakes", "1/2 cup apple-cider vinegar", "12 tablespoons salted French butter", "12 tablespoons water", "3 cups frozen fresh shelled soybeans", "Kosher salt to taste", "Tofu", "Gastrique", "Gray sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the dried yellow soybeans in tap water overnight at room temperature, making sure they are covered by 2 inches of water."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Strain water from soybeans."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour 3 cups of filtered water into a large heavy-duty blender, then add in the strained beans.
