Add lard or shortening cut into small pieces and process with an on-off or pulse control for a few seconds, until the mixture achieves a uniform mealy texture. Then, with the machine running, add the water a tablespoon at a time, through the feed tube. You will probably need the smaller amount of water and perhaps as little as one to one-and-a-half tablespoons because of the speed with which a food processor amalgamates the ingredients. Process only until a ball of dough forms."}]}
