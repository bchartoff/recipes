{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Mushrooms and Broccoli", "description": "Broccoli stems and flowers can be prepared and cooked separately, like two different vegetables. For this pasta I used a vegetable peeler to shred the broccoli stems into thin ribbons, which I cooked briefly with the mushrooms. I sliced the crowns very thin and blanched them briefly with the pasta. The result is a dish with different textures and shades of green: the stems should be crisp-tender, their color faded. The crowns will be bright green, and 2 to 2 1/2 minutes cooking will render them tender but not mushy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/17/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 107}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large stalks broccoli (stems and crowns)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves (optional)", "8 ounces spaghetti", "Freshly grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut broccoli stalks away from crowns and peel stalks.
