It calls for a lot of ingredients, but don\u2019t be dismayed. You can easily eliminate some or make substitutions. Don\u2019t like shrimp? Go with 100 percent fish. Or vice versa. You can also add ham or sausage (like tasso ham or andouille sausage) for a bit more heartiness. Historically, the word gumbo denotes the presence of okra (also called gumbo), and it\u2019s used here. Another conventional gumbo component and important ingredient in African-based Creole cooking is fil\u00e9 powder, the crushed leaves of the sassafras tree. Then, there is usually a dark roux made of vegetable oil and flour in authentic New Orleans gumbo. All three of these ingredients \u2013 okra, fil\u00e9 powder and the dark oil-and-flour roux \u2013 are the thickening agents for this fairly spicy dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacques Pepin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/17/dining/17COOKING-PEPIN-SEAFOODGUMBO2/17COOKING-PEPIN-SEAFOODGUMBO2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "creole", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, seafood, soups and stews", "keywords": "main course, okra, shrimp, white fish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 350}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 307, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1057 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 quarts water", "3/4 pound fish fillets (cod, pollock or another variety of fresh white fish), cut into 1-inch pieces", "1/2 pound (about 26) small peeled fresh or frozen shrimp", "1/4 cup canola oil", "1/3 cup flour", "2 onions, peeled and sliced (about 2 1/2 cups)", "1/2 cup long-grain rice", "About 7 scallions, damaged leaves removed and discarded; cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 1/2 cups), both white and green parts", "5 cloves garlic, peeled, crushed and chopped (about 1 tablespoon)", "2 tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 cup sliced celery", "1 green pepper, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1/2 pound okra, ends trimmed, cut into 1 1/2-inch-long rounds", "2 teaspoons salt", "1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped fine (about 1 tablespoon)", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1 tablespoon  fil\u00e9 powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saucepan or stockpot, bring the water to a boil.
