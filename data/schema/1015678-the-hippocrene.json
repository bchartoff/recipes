It's best to let this mixture chill and dilute a little while before adding everything else, but if time is short, it could be refrigerated beforehand and water (sparkling or still) can be added along with the rest of the ingredients at service time. The basil should still be added directly to the glass, as it is the aroma and not necessarily the flavor that you're after. It would also be nice to garnish the mixing bowl with some citrus slices, for color and a generally vigorous appearance."}]}
