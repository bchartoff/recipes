(A recent example: \u201cverbena mousse, plum, buckwheat, camelina oil.\u201d) But when it comes to the family meal, when members of the kitchen team meet up for a mass nosh, Mr. Livingston is known for baking something more traditional: chocolate chip cookies. \u201cI think they stand out because of the texture,\u201d he said, citing his blend of all-purpose flour, bread flour and melted butter. Pay attention to the process, though. \u201cWhen making them at home, set aside enough time for your dough to be chilled,\u201d he advised. \u201cThe cookies bake better when they are going straight from freezer or fridge directly into the oven.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/05/dining/20151105-NOMA-slide-6G5B/20151105-NOMA-slide-6G5B-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "3 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "chocolate chips, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 304}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 89, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "46 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["11 tablespoons/150 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/2 cup/100 grams packed dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup/88 grams granulated sugar", "1 egg plus 1 yolk", "1 cup/150 grams bread flour", "1/3 cup/50 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon/4 grams salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 cup/125 grams chocolate chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar for 3 minutes.
