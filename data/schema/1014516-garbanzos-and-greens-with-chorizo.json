Cover with 6 cups water, add the onion stuck with clove, the carrot and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower heat and let chickpeas simmer gently. Skim any foam that rises to the surface. Cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until chickpeas are tender. (If chickpeas seem to be drying out during cooking, add 1/2 cup water to keep them submerged in liquid.) Season generously with salt, and leave chickpeas to cool in the broth (cooking liquid). You should have about 2 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas. (They may be cooked a day in advance, if desired.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put olive oil in a deep, wide skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the chorizo and let it fry a bit, then turn heat to medium. Add the garlic, piment\u00f3n and 1/2 teaspoon of the cumin, and stir to coat. Add the cooked chickpeas and 1/2 cup broth. Bring to a simmer, add the greens and sprinkle with a little salt. Stir to allow the greens to wilt. Put on the lid and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until greens are completely cooked. Stir well, taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. To serve as a tapa or side dish, transfer to a cazuela or deep serving platter. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin and the pine nuts, if using. Alternatively, to serve as soup, spoon the garbanzo-and-greens mixture into 4 deep soup bowls. Ladle 1 cup heated broth into each bowl, and sprinkle soup with the remaining cumin."}]}
