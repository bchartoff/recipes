The batter comes together quickly in a food processor, and the cake bakes at 350 degrees for a while, giving the baker time to assemble the frosting, which is given a luscious sheen by a bit of corn syrup. Use the best chocolate you can find for the frosting, and gild it however you like: with a few flowers, some birthday candles or nothing at all.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/15/dining/All-In-One-Chocolate-Cake/All-In-One-Chocolate-Cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chocolate, cocoa powder, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 728}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 507, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "113 milligrams", "sugarContent": "47 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter for greasing baking pans", "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 cup sugar", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/3 cup best-quality cocoa powder", "6 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla", "3/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature", "6 ounces good-quality semisweet chocolate, broken into small pieces", "3 ounces ( 3/4 stick) unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon light corn syrup", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla", "2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For cake: heat oven to 350 degrees.
