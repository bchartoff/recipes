He settled on Trickling Springs, available at the Stinky Bklyn cheese shop in Brooklyn. But any good cream (and Irish whiskey) will do, as long as you use high-quality, freshly brewed coffee and very cold whipped cream. Making the sugar syrup takes a few more minutes, but pays off in a subtle sweetness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/12/dining/12COFFEE/12COFFEE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "quick, cocktails", "keywords": "coffee, whiskey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 47}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 691, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "143 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "46 milligrams", "sugarContent": "141 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup Demerara sugar", "Heavy cream, preferably Trickling Springs or another high-quality brand", "1 1/2 ounces Irish whiskey, preferably Powers Gold Label", "4 ounces hot, freshly made coffee", "Dash of ground nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Warm an Irish coffee glass or mug by filling with hot water, then draining."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make Demerara syrup: Put the sugar and 1/2 cup water into a small saucepan; place over low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.
