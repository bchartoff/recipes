{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vanilla-Honey Soft Serve Ice Cream", "description": "You don\u2019t need an ice cream maker for rich, custardy ice cream. With the help of an electric mixer and food processor, you can create ice cream with the texture of soft serve. One of the keys to a silky texture without the ice crystals that plague other no-churn ice cream recipes is using cream cheese (a trick picked up from Jeni Britton Bauer of Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams). This helps hold the custard's emulsification even during freezing. This ice cream is best served right out of the food processor or blender, but if you want to make it entirely ahead, take it out of the freezer 20 minutes before serving. If you would like to make this recipe with an ice cream maker, freeze the custard according to manufacturer\u2019s directions after cooling it completely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/08/multimedia/clark-honey-icecream/clark-honey-icecream-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 pints", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "cream cheese, heavy cream, honey, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 247}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 278, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "90 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/79 milliliters flavorful honey", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 cups/710 milliliters heavy cream", "3 ounces/85 grams cream cheese, cubed, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/79 milliliters whole milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together yolks, sugar, honey, vanilla and salt until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring cream to a simmer."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisking the yolks constantly, slowly pour half the hot cream into the egg mixture.
