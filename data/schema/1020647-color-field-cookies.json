Use gel food coloring for the best results, and blend the colors together gradually, using the tip of a toothpick to control their transformation. For muted tones, add a touch of brown, or a complementary color, like a drop of purple to bright orange. Try a mixing lighter color first. Then, once you\u2019ve used it, make it darker. For example, sky blue can be deepened  with the addition of royal blue, navy blue or a combination. Don\u2019t feel tied to the colors produced in Kelly\u2019s work, but rather, think of these as an experiment in color.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/ss-color-cookies/merlin_163736859_309992ab-fd0e-462c-85a2-9fcddeb29427-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 227}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (1-pound/455-gram) box confectioners\u2019 sugar (3 3/4 cups), plus more if needed", "3 tablespoons light corn syrup", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice", "3 to 4 tablespoons warm water, plus more if needed", "Gel food coloring, preferably red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown and white", "1 <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020651\">recipe Basic Sugar Cookies</a>, cut into 3-inch circles, baked and cooled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the glaze:\u00a0Combine box of confectioners\u2019 sugar, corn syrup, lemon juice and 3 tablespoons warm water in a medium bowl.
