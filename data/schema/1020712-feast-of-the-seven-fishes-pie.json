{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Feast of the Seven Fishes Pie", "description": "A velvety fish pie, filled with chunks of seafood in a delicate sauce, is classic cold-weather comfort food in the British Isles. This seafood pie is fancier than most. It\u2019s got a buttery puff pastry topping that turns golden and crunchy as it bakes. And it\u2019s brimming with seven varieties of fish, including scallops and shrimp, to make it festive enough to serve for a blowout Christmas Eve meal, like the Italian-American celebration Feast of the Seven Fishes. That said, if you\u2019d rather keep things simpler, using just two or three kinds of fish still results in a stunning pie. Alaskan wild pollock, a mild, flaky fish that\u2019s becoming more and more available in seafood markets, is a lovely and sustainable choice, as is Pacific cod.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/18/dining/13Apperex/merlin_165684945_becc0a2e-826a-4cd3-a618-3e5486964200-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H50M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "anchovies, clam juice, dry white wine, leek, puff pastry, sea scallop, shrimp, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 574}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 large leeks, white and light green parts only, halved and thinly sliced (4 cups)", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 garlic clove, minced", "2 anchovies, minced", "1/2 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour, more for rolling out pastry", "3/4 cup chicken stock", "1/2 cup clam juice", "1 pound mixed mild fish fillets, cut into 1 1/4-inch thick cubes (such as cod and pollock)", "1/2 pound large shelled shrimp (16 to 20 count)", "1/2 pound large sea scallops, side muscle removed", "1 cup frozen peas", "1 tablespoon chopped tarragon", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons drained capers, chopped", "1 large egg", "1 pound puff pastry, thawed", "1 cup sour cream, for serving (optional)", "1 ounce salmon or trout roe or other caviar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butter a shallow 1 1/2-quart baking dish or casserole.
