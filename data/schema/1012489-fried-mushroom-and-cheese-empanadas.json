I found that the dough is easy to make in a food processor, so whipping up a dozen or more is not a challenge. Baking, instead of frying, is a healthier and convenient option. But the dough has to be rolled as thin as possible, especially for folded Chilean-style empanadas that result in several layers along the edges.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/06/dining/Fried-Mushroom-and-Cheese-Empanadas/Fried-Mushroom-and-Cheese-Empanadas-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "24 cocktail empanadas", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, fall, gouda cheese, mushroom", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 14}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 92, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "94 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 1/3 cups minced onion", "12 ounces white mushrooms, minced", "3 tablespoons dry white wine", "Salt", "fresh black pepper", "Empanada dough (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012490-empanada-dough\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>)", "6 ounces Gouda, minced", "1 large egg, lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon water", "Vegetable oil for deep-frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet.
