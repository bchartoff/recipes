Sliced bacon is cooked until tender, blending in but imparting its smoky, porky essence, while crisp bacon morsels are sprinkled on top for a salty, crunchy hit. This 30-minute dish is great spooned over rice or polenta, or alongside buttery cornbread for a hearty weeknight meal, but you could also top it with an egg to bring it into brunch territory.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/dining/gk-greens-and-beans/gk-greens-and-beans-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "bacon, collard greens, greens, hot sauce, kale, kidney bean, mustard greens, side dish, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 130}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 326, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "831 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 bunches dark and sturdy leafy greens, like collards, kale or mustard greens (about 1 pound)", "4 bacon slices", "1 large red onion (about 1 pound), finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 garlic cloves, sliced", "1 teaspoon dried sage", "1 cup chicken or vegetable stock", "2 (15-ounce) cans red kidney beans, rinsed and drained", "1 teaspoon hot sauce, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the greens: Cut the tough stems out of the greens and discard.
