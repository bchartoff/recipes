The onions should melt down almost to a pur\u00e9e. Add the garlic, thyme and capers, and taste and adjust salt. Stir together, cover and simmer for another 15 to 30 minutes until the mixture is sweet and golden. Remove the lid; if there is liquid in the pan, cook uncovered until the pur\u00e9e is thick and the liquid is gone."}]}
