{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Chicken With Fennel", "description": "The kind of fennel we see in supermarkets (which, almost needless to say, is cultivated, not wild) is wonderful when cooked to full tenderness, so I thought it might make a good base for chicken, which is heavier than fish and takes longer to cook. The idea was that the fennel would lend its flavor to the chicken, the chicken would lend its juices to the fennel and the creation would need little else. The results were better than expected. Garnished with parsley and served with a bit of lemon (especially when caramelized, fennel can be quite sweet), the dish has an elegant look and delicious, surprisingly complex flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/20/dining/20COOKING-ROASTCHICKEN2/20COOKING-ROASTCHICKEN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "chicken, extra virgin olive oil, fennel, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 403}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 693, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "855 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, or as needed", "2 bulbs fennel, trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 whole (about 3-pound) chicken, cut up, or about 3 pounds drumsticks and thighs", "Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
