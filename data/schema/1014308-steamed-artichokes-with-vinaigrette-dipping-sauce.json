They are a good source of magnesium, potassium and fiber, and they require a little work, but it\u2019s time well-spent.  The simplest way to prepare an artichoke is to steam it, there\u2019s hardly any trimming at all.  Serve it with a dipping sauce and work your way, perhaps with a friend or loved one, to the heart. Then scrape away the chokes and divvy up the prize at the middle.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/04/06/health/06recipehealth_600/06recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "artichoke, mayonnaise, yogurt, healthy, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 86}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 253, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "282 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large or 4 medium artichokes", "1 lemon, cut in half", "", "2 tablespoons white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 small garlic clove, minced or pureed", "2 tablespoon Best Foods or Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons plain low-fat yogurt", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "Sea salt or kosher salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay an artichoke on its side on a cutting board.
