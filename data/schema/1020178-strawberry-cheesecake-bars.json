{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Cheesecake Bars", "description": "Great for picnics or potlucks, these portable cheesecake bars incorporate cooked berries directly into the custard, which means they take on a rosy hue. You can even add a few drops of red food coloring if you want to make up for out-of-season berries, which are less vibrantly colored, or if you just want a livelier result. Feel free to use frozen berries in place of fresh, though you\u2019ll need to thaw them fully before beginning the process.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/15/dining/em-strawberry-cheesecake-bars/em-strawberry-cheesecake-bars-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13-inch pan (about 15 bars)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes, custards and puddings", "keywords": "cream cheese, eggs, heavy cream, shortbread, strawberries, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 218}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 513, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "347 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "10 1/2 ounces/300 grams shortbread cookies", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted", "1 1/2 pounds strawberries, hulled and halved (about 4 cups)", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "3 (8-ounce) packages/680 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "5 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "Red food coloring, as needed", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters heavy cream", "1/2 cup/60 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 pound strawberries, hulled and thinly sliced (about 2 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9-by-13-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In a food processor, pulse the cookies until they form fine crumbs (you should have about 2 1/2 cups).
