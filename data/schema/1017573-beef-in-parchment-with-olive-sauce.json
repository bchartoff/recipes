To dress it in flip-flops, I thought of pairing it with meat served barely warm, rather than grilled. French poached boeuf \u00e0 la ficelle came to mind, but who wants to simmer a vessel of stock in July? I decided to roast the meat wrapped in parchment to capture all the juices for a sauce, then serve the dish at room temperature. I had never seen a chunk of fillet cooked like that, and I worried I might sacrifice $60. Sous vide would have been an option, but it was more complicated and would take longer. My method was successful, and my sauce, made with sweet, slightly briny little olives and fresh rosemary, nicely balanced the fruity, earthy, yet still tannic wines.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/29/dining/29PAIR_web/29PAIR-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beef fillet, ni\u00e7oise olives, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 48}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 571, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "572 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds center-cut fillet of beef in one piece", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1/2 cup minced shallots", "3/4 cup pitted ni\u00e7oise olives", "1 large sprig rosemary, plus more for garnish", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
