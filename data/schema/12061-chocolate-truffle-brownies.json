{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Truffle Brownies", "description": "If you're a member of the cake-y brownie club, move along. If fudge-y is your jam, step right up. These brownies are soft, dense and super-rich, but the best part is that they are incredibly simple to make. Melt butter in a saucepan (we often melt ours in the microwave because who needs another pot to clean?) then stir in the chocolate until it's melted. Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients, pour it all into a buttered pan, slide it into the oven and in about a half hour: brownies worthy of their name.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "William Norwich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/10/dining/10COOKING-CHOC-TRUFFLE-BROWNIES1/10COOKING-CHOCOLATE-TRUFFLE-BROWNIES1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "24 brownies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 260}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 212, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "93 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["11 tablespoons (155 g) unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing the pan", "6 ounces (170 g) good unsweetened chocolate, chopped", "2 1/3 cups (465 g) sugar", "6 large eggs", "1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract", "1 1/3 cups (165 g) all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon salt", "1 cup/120 grams chopped nuts or 1 cup/175 grams chocolate chips (optional)", "Cocoa powder (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
