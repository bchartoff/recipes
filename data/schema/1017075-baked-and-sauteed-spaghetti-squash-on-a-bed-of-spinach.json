{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked and Saut\u00e9ed Spaghetti Squash on a Bed of Spinach", "description": "I played around with a number of ideas for this spaghetti squash on a bed of spinach. In one recipe test I mixed some pesto into the spaghetti squash; that tasted good but it wasn\u2019t very pretty. I was sad to lose the bright color of the squash \u2013 plus you might not have pesto on hand -- so I decided not to fiddle too much with the saut\u00e9ed squash and to go for a nutty accent, drizzling walnut oil and sprinkling chopped walnuts over the finished dish. Spaghetti squash has great texture but a rather bland flavor, so feel free to try other robust seasonings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/16/science/19recipeforhealth/19recipeforhealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, winter, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 206, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "712 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 spaghetti squash, about 3 pounds", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 plump garlic cloves, minced", "Salt", "1 12-ounce bag (or box) baby spinach, rinsed", "2 tablespoons bread crumbs", "Lots of freshly ground pepper", "1 teaspoon sumac (optional)", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (more to taste)", "1/4 cup chopped walnuts (more to taste)", "1 tablespoon walnut oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
