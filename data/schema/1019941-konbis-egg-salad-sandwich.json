{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Konbi\u2019s Egg Salad Sandwich", "description": "This famous egg salad sandwich comes from Konbi, the tiny Los Angeles cafe run by co-chefs Akira Akuto and Nick Montgomery. It\u2019s not always the case that sensational, Instagram-famous dishes are carefully calibrated to taste so good, but this one breaks the mold: It\u2019s as pretty as it is delicious. The egg salad is brightened with a touch of rice wine vinegar and mustard and bound with Kewpie mayonnaise. When making it at home, be careful not to undercook the eggs or you\u2019ll cross that fine line between jammy and runny. At the heart of the sandwich is a perfect hard-boiled egg, and we suggest cooking a couple extra in case they break or you have trouble peeling them. Extra eggs, still warm, with a touch of salt and pepper, make for a great snack while you're assembling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/dining/30eggrex1/30eggrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, lunch, sandwiches", "keywords": "cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, dijon mustard, eggs, mayonnaise, white bread, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 520}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 202, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "276 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice cubes, for ice baths", "1 scallion, very thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon Kewpie mayonnaise, plus more for spreading on bread", "1 tablespoon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 1/2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, plus more for spreading on bread", "Kosher salt", "12 large eggs", "Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon", "8 slices <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016275-japanese-milk-bread\">milk bread</a>, brioche or white sandwich bread"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large pot with water, leaving a few inches of space at the top, and bring to a boil over high.
