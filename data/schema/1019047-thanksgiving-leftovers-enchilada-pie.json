It sounds a little strange, but we promise you, it\u2019s surprisingly delicious. It\u2019s easy to make, and anything you don't already have on had can be picked up from the corner store. We used leftover turkey, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6165-braised-greens\">braised greens</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6278-maple-whipped-sweet-potatoes\">mashed sweet potatoes</a>, but feel free to experiment with savory dishes like saut\u00e9ed brussels sprouts, cornbread stuffing or mashed potatoes. Top your slice with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019048-cranberry-sauce-salsa\">cranberry sauce salsa</a>, a dollop of sour cream and a scattering of roasted pumpkin seeds. (We used a mix of Velveeta, Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses because the Velveeta helps prevent clumping, but, if processed cheese bothers you, leave it out and add a half-cup more Cheddar or Monterey Jack.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/09/dining/09COOKING-ENCHILADA-PIE/09COOKING-ENCHILADA-PIE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, burritos and nachos, casseroles", "keywords": "fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 321}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 457, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "800 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing the pie plate (or nonstick cooking spray)", "\u00bc cup chopped onion", "\u00bd teaspoon cumin", "2 cups leftover cooked turkey, shredded", "Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper", "8 5 \u00bd-inch soft corn tortillas", "1 (10-ounce) can red enchilada sauce", "2 cups Thanksgiving leftovers (used singly or a combination of sweet potatoes, saut\u00e9ed greens or corn, or canned black beans, drained)", "1 \u00bd cups shredded Cheddar cheese or any combination of shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack", "1/2 cup (4 ounces) Velveeta cheese, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
