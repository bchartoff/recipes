Sometimes I make it in winter, just to remind myself that summer's coming.\n\nThe recipe is a series of suggestions and it is eminently flexible. The zucchini and tomatoes, though not absolutely essential, are Proven\u00e7al classics, but you can use whatever vegetables you can find as long as you finish the thing with basil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "pastas, project, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, garlic, pasta, vegetables, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 411, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1107 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup fresh shell beans (like cranberry or lima), soaked for a couple of hours in water to cover, or 1/2 cup dried beans, soaked overnight (or boiled for 2 minutes and soaked for 2 hours), drained", "1 large onion, peeled and chopped", "2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped", "2 celery stalks, trimmed and chopped", "2 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped", "2 small to medium zucchini, trimmed and chopped", "2 tomatoes, cored, seeded and chopped", "6 to 8 garlic cloves, peeled", "2 cups fresh basil leaves, washed", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and pepper to taste", "1 cup small pasta like ditalini, or capellini broken into pieces", "Freshly grated Parmesan to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put beans, onion, carrots, celery and potatoes in a large saucepan with water to cover by at least 2 inches.
