{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bitter Giuseppe", "description": "Cynar is a low-proof, bittersweet amaro derived from artichokes, among many other ingredients. Italians typically drink it over ice with a slice of orange. But it has found a home in many cocktails thanks to adventurous American mixologists who not only treat it as a supporting player, but also sometimes as the foundation of a drink. Such is the case with the Bitter Giuseppe, a creation of the Chicago bartender Stephen Cole. The cocktail calls for a full two ounces of Cynar. Though audacious in concept, the drink is easy to understand if you think of it as a Cynar manhattan. The lemon juice, lemon twist and extra bitters do much to lighten up the mixture, which is brighter and more buoyant than you might expect. A great aperitivo cocktail.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/05/dining/AMARO2/AMARO2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cynar, orange bitters, sweet vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 92}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "6 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces Cynar", "1 ounce Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth", "1/4 ounce lemon juice, plus lemon twist for garnish", "6 dashes orange bitters, preferably Regans\u2019"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine liquid ingredients in a mixing glass three-quarters filled with ice.
