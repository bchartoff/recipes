{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Almond Butter", "description": "While many nut butters contain added sugar or hydrogenated oils, this homemade recipe contains just nuts, and maybe a little salt if you\u2019re so inclined. The secret to a deeply nutty flavor is twofold: Leaving the skins on and roasting the almonds before pur\u00e9eing both add complexity. For a chocolate version, blend in some maple syrup and cacao nibs (start with about 2 tablespoons of each, then adjust to your liking). A few drops of pure almond extract would also add a nice flavor boost, reminiscent of marzipan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/09/dining/kc-almond-butter/kc-almond-butter-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "1 3/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "almonds, salt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 248, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "0 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound raw, skin-on almonds (about 3 cups)", "Kosher salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
