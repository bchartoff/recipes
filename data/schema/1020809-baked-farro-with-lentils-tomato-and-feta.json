{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Farro With Lentils, Tomato and Feta", "description": "This cold-weather comfort food is loaded with bright flavors and delightful textures. Farro and lentils cook in the same amount of time, so you can bake them together in a garlicky tomato sauce to yield silky, tender lentils and chewy, toothsome farro. For an extra nutty flavor, you can toast the farro first. To finish the dish, place large slices of feta on top and broil until the cheese slouches in the center and crisps at the edges, but you can also use mozzarella or Cheddar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/16/dining/as-baked-farro/as-baked-farro-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, grains and rice, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, spring, winter, farro, feta, lentils, tomato, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 565}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup farro", "1/2 cup dried green or brown lentils", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 (28-ounce) can tomato pur\u00e9e (or substitute your favorite tomato sauce)", "2\u00a0sprigs oregano, thyme, rosemary or basil, or 1/2 teaspoon dried (all optional)", "1 (8-ounce) block feta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and place one rack 6 inches from the broiler.
