There\u2019s only one problem with this comforting culinary scenario: It\u2019s mostly not true. These ribs are grilled naked, save for some salt and pepper. Afterward, they are cut into individual ribs and tossed with hoisin sauce, soy sauce, orange juice and ginger and sprinkled with a spicy peanut shake. You get the ease of last-minute preparation and brighter, clearer, more direct flavors and you can show off a bit for your guest as you mix and toss at the last minute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby And Chris Schlesinger"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/21/dining/21JPGRILLING1/21JPGRILLING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 appetizer servings, 3 to 4 entree servings", "recipeCuisine": "barbecue", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "baby back ribs, peanut, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 110}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 926, "unsaturatedFatContent": "41 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "67 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "71 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "1133 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup dry-roasted peanuts, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon roasted sesame oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons chile powder", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions", "2 racks of baby back ribs, about 2 1/4 pounds each", "Salt and pepper to taste", "1/3 cup hoisin sauce", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup orange juice (freshly squeezed is best)", "2 tablespoons minced ginger", "Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the shake: Combine the peanuts, sesame oil and chile powder in a small bowl and mix well, then put in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium-low heat and toast, tossing occasionally, until light brown and very fragrant, about 8 to 10 minutes.
