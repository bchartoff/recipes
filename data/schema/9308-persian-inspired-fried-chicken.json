{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Persian-Inspired Fried Chicken", "description": "Here is a fried chicken recipe that is the best kind of weeknight cooking, with ingredients found quickly at most local grocery stores, whirled in a food processor and then left overnight to turn into something delicious the next evening. A yogurt marinade helps tenderize the boneless, skinless chicken thighs, infusing them with saffron and paprika, and a quick frying lends the meat a crispy, minty coating. You can marinate the chicken for 3 hours or overnight, but you set the timetable depending on whatever else is going on. This chicken will adapt. Make one night, finish the next.
