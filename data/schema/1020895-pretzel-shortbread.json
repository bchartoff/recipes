{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pretzel Shortbread", "description": "Flecked with sea salt on the outside, buttery and supremely crunchy within, this pretzel shortbread leans to the savory side, both salty and sweet. This version, created by Lost Bread Company in Philadelphia, mixes crumbs from the bakery\u2019s own sourdough pretzels into the dough. But any pretzels will give the shortbread the necessary tang. The bakery also dips the shortbread into a lye solution before baking to give them that characteristic glossy surface. This simplified version calls for either using baking soda or an egg white. The slightly bitter baking soda mixture adds some of the complex flavor of the lye, but using an egg white is simpler, and the cookies are nearly as delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/28Appe1/merlin_169351569_a62b84f9-83de-4f55-8f5b-893e6dd0620a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "About 15 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "demerara sugar, flour, pretzel crumbs, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 455}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/65 grams pretzel crumbs (see Note)", "3 1/4 cups/415 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/210 grams Demerara sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/310 grams unsalted cold butter (2 3/4 sticks), cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1/4 cup baking soda, or 1 large egg white", "Pretzel salt or flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
