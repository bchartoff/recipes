{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Deathbed Manhattan", "description": "Allen Katz, founder of the New York Distilling Company in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, spent years worrying over his first rye whiskey, tasting and testing it until it was ripe for bottling. So it only makes sense that he would fuss over the manhattan recipe that uses his new Ragtime Rye. After some tests, he settled on splitting the vermouth component between two products: the bolder, fruitier Martini & Rossi sweet vermouth and the more complex, dry, herbaceous Punt e Mes. Otherwise, it\u2019s a straightforward version of this classic cocktail, which traditionally called for rye. And it lives up to its name: It\u2019s so good, you may request it as your final drink.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/02/dining/02RYE2/02RYE2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "rye whiskey, sweet vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 116}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 169, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": null, "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "1 milligram", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces rye whiskey, preferably Ragtime", "1/2 ounce Punt e Mes vermouth", "1/2 ounce Martini & Rossi sweet vermouth", "2 dashes Angostura bitters", "1 maraschino cherry, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all the liquid ingredients in a mixing glass three-quarters filled with ice, and stir until chilled, about 30 seconds.
