{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Thighs Stuffed With Chard", "description": "Stuffing boneless chicken has long been reserved for breasts, but most chicken breasts have so little flavor that you almost have to stuff them with fat. Thighs, however, are fattier and more flavorful, so a stuffing can be leaner and brighter. And now that boneless thighs are sold in many supermarkets, the only issues are flattening and rolling. But if you pound a thigh as you would a breast, it becomes large enough to stuff and roll (Because thighs are irregularly shaped, you\u2019ll need to skewer them closed with a couple of toothpicks).  Almost any stuffing will work; just don\u2019t overfill. My current favorite uses a light, leafy green, along with pine nuts and raisins. The result is nicely browned meat and a lean stuffing with acidity, crunch and sweetness. For more flavor, I like to finish with a splash of sherry; with the liquid spooned over the thighs and a sprinkle of parsley, the dish becomes downright impressive.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/20/dining/20COOKING-CHIXTHIGH-CHARD1/20COOKING-CHIXTHIGH-CHARD1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, swiss chard, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 87}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 569, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1037 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds chard", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon chopped garlic", "1/2 cup pine nuts", "1/2 cup raisins, soaked in warm water for about 10 minutes, drained", "Salt and pepper to taste", "8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1/2 cup dry (fino) sherry or a flavorful white wine", "Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut chard stems into 1- to 2-inch lengths, and coarsely chop leaves.
