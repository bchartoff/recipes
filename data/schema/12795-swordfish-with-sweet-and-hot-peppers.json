Here, the sweet peppers are saut\u00e9ed slowly with onions to intensify their gentle honeyed character. Half of the hot chiles are left raw, sharp and biting to create as much contrast as possible. Eaten altogether, each bite is both hot and sweet, pungent from a touch of garlic, tart from a squeeze of lemon and faintly saline from the swordfish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/07/dining/07swordfish/07swordfish-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "main course, swordfish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 109}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 428, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "733 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small white onion, thinly sliced", "4 cups sliced sweet peppers (a mix of bell peppers, cubanelle and others, as many colors as possible)", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano ", "1 1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 1/2 pounds swordfish, skin removed, cut into 1 1/4-inch chunks", "2 to 3 fresh chile de arbol or other hot chile peppers, seeded if desired, and thinly sliced", "1 garlic clove, minced", "Lemon juice, as needed", "Chopped cilantro, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
