To that I will add how easy it is to make.\n\nThe only part that needs some attention is the frying of the onions (or in this case, leeks). To get them crisp, you have to cook them until they are deeply brown and darker than you might be comfortable with. But without the deep color, you don\u2019t get the crunch. Just make sure to take them off the heat before they burn. You want the majority to be mahogany, not black (though a few black strands would be O.K.).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/31/dining/mujadaravideo/mujadaravideo-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, one pot", "keywords": "leek, lentils, spring greens, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 867}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "209 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup brown or green lentils", "2 leeks, white and light green parts only, roots trimmed", "2 1/4 teaspoons salt, more as needed", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "3/4 cup long-grain rice", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne", "1 bay leaf", "1 cinnamon stick", "4 cups trimmed and chopped spring greens (chard leaves, spinach, kale, mustard or a combination)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place lentils in a large bowl and add warm tap water to cover by 1 inch.
