The recipe was to be printed for the last time that year. \u201cTo counter anticipated protests,\u201d Ms. Burros wrote a few years later, \u201cthe recipe was printed in larger type than usual with a broken-line border around it to encourage clipping.\u201d It didn\u2019t help. The paper was flooded with angry letters. \u201cThe appearance of the recipe, like the torte itself, is bittersweet,\u201d wrote a reader in Tarrytown, N.Y. \u201cSummer is leaving, fall is coming.

And we pledge that every year, as summer gives way to fall, we will make sure that the recipe is easily available to one and all.
