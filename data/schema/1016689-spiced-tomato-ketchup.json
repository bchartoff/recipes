{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Tomato Ketchup", "description": "This sauce is a tomato jam that tastes more like a richly spiced ketchup. A long simmer is important. This is inspired by a recipe for a delicious tomato jam in the chef Matthew Kenney\u2019s cookbook, \u201cMatthew Kenney\u2019s Mediterranean Cooking.\u201d My version is not as sweet as his; I decided to call it ketchup rather than jam because to me, it tastes like a richly spiced ketchup, with sweet and sour flavors and a little kick from the cayenne. A long simmer is important for cooking the sauce to the right consistency and for concentrating the flavors. After that, I put the ketchup through a food mill to achieve smoother texture, but that step is optional. I salt toward the end of cooking because the mix will reduce quite a lot and it\u2019s too easy to oversalt if you salt before that happens. However, be sure to use enough salt to balance out the sweetness and bring out the spice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/22/science/24recipehealth/24recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H20M", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 2/3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low calorie, low cholesterol, low-fat, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 30}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 219, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "763 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 cup cider vinegar", "1/4 cup packed brown sugar", "2 pounds tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced or pulsed to a coarse pur\u00e9e in a food processor", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "8 allspice berries, ground (1/2 teaspoon)", "2 cloves, ground", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon mild honey, such as clover"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat olive oil over low heat in a heavy-bottom saucepan.
