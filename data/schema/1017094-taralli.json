{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Taralli", "description": "Taralli are delicious ring shaped rusk-like Italian snacks from Apulia and Campania. Now that I know how easy they are to make I could be in big trouble, as whenever I\u2019ve bought them from one of my favorite Italian delis I have a hard time resisting them. It\u2019s the olive oil, I now know, that makes them special and different from other twice-baked breads. They are crisp but not hard, and this whole wheat version is as good as any traditional taralli I\u2019ve tasted. I particularly like the version with black pepper. But I like them plain, without any embellishment, as well. The olive oil gives them so much flavor on its own. This recipe is based on a recipe in Carol Field\u2019s \u201cItaly In Small Bites.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/30/science/recipehealthtarali/recipehealthtarali-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "36 taralli", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "lunch, snack, breads", "keywords": "dairy-free, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 55}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 79, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "56 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup / 118 milliliters dry white wine, warmed to lukewarm (95 to 115 degrees)", "1/2 cup / 118 milliliters lukewarm water", "1/2 cup / 118 milliliters extra virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons instant yeast", "180 grams / 1 1/2 cups unbleached all purpose flour", "320 grams /  2 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds or 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine wine and water in a small bowl or measuring cup and add yeast.
