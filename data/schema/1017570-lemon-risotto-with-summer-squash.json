The stock should just cover the rice and should be bubbling, not too slowly but not too quickly. Cook, stirring often, until the rice is just about absorbed. Add another ladleful or two of the stock, and continue to cook in this fashion, stirring in more stock when the rice is almost dry. You do not have to stir constantly, but stir often."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When the rice is tender all the way through but still chewy, in about 25 minutes, it is done.

The mixture should be creamy (add more stock if it isn\u2019t). Serve right away in wide soup bowls or on plates, spreading the risotto in a thin layer rather than a mound."}]}
