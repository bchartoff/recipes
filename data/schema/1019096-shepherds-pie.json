{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shepherd\u2019s Pie", "description": "Shepherds are in the business of herding sheep, which makes lamb the most obvious choice for this pie, but ground beef is a tasty addition. The combination of ground lamb and ground beef is earthy and robust, and keeps lamb\u2019s gaminess in check. Ground lamb tends to be fatty, so this recipe uses lean ground beef to compensate. If you prefer all beef, be sure to use something with a little more fat. And if you prefer all lamb, you may want to skim off some of the extra fat after browning the meat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/13/dining/13COOKING-SHEPHERDS-PIE2/13COOKING-SHEPHERDS-PIE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, meat", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 855}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 726, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "1073 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "2 1/2 pounds (about 3 to 4 large) russet potatoes, peeled and quartered", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup whole milk", "1 cup shredded aged white Cheddar", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 small yellow onion, diced small (about 1 1/4 cups)", "2 medium carrots, peeled and diced small (about 1 1/4 cups)", "4 cloves garlic, minced", "4 sprigs fresh thyme", "2 4-inch sprigs fresh rosemary", "3/4 pounds lean ground beef", "3/4 pounds ground lamb", "1/3 cup tomato paste", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup beef stock", "1 cup fresh parsley, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil over high heat.
