{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Almond Cake With Lemon Glaze", "description": "Most lemon cakes rely on zest and juice for flavor. This one uses the whole fruit, pith and all, for an intense citrus flavor. There\u2019s also almond flour in the batter, which gives the cake a dense richness. If you can get Meyer lemons, use them here. Most likely the hybrid of a lemon and a mandarin, Meyer lemons, with thin skins and plenty of juice, are a bit sweeter and less acidic than regular lemons.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/24/dining/24apperex1/24apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "almond extract, almond flour, meyer lemon, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 571}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 493, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "238 milligrams", "sugarContent": "52 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted and cooled, plus more for the pan", "1/2 cup/65 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan", "3 medium lemons, preferably Meyer lemons", "2 cups/225 grams almond flour or meal (or ground almonds)", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "5 large eggs, separated", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams sugar", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "1 to 1 1/2 cups/125 to 185 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan.
