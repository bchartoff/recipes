{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato Cavatelli", "description": "These are an easy, homey version of handmade pasta that freeze well. They are sturdier and more toothsome than gnocchi but have more character than dried cavatelli. It takes a little practice to get the flip of the indentation just right, but once you get the feel for it you can turn out enough for dinner quickly. They hold up well under a heavy tomato rag\u00f9, but also take well to a simple sauce of butter, a little pasta water and Parmesan or pecorino. This recipe is easy to double, too, which leaves plenty to freeze for another night. Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet dusted in flour, then store in a zippered plastic bag.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/dining/potato-cavatelli-horizontal/potato-cavatelli-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings as a first course, 4 as a main course", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, dumplings, pastas", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, russet potatoes", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 132}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 469, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "366 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large russet potatoes", "1 tablespoon butter", "1/4 cup milk", "1/4 cup neutral oil, like canola", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 eggs", "3 cups flour/450 grams, plus more for rolling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Boil potatoes unpeeled and send through a ricer to make 2 cups.
