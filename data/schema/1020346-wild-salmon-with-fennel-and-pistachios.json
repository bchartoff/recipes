{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wild Salmon With Fennel and Pistachios", "description": "Assertively flavorful, lush-textured wild Pacific salmon \u2014 notably king, but also sockeye \u2014 are seasonal treasures. Unlike farmed Atlantic salmon, which is of a different genus entirely and available year-round, Pacific salmon is a late spring through summer catch. Its richness makes a fairly modest portion satisfying. In this recipe I paired it with fennel, pistachios and lemon. I started the fish fillet in a very hot oven (not quite volcanic, but about as hot as a home oven can get) then immediately cut the temperature down and let the salmon cook for another 15 to 20 minutes. It\u2019s a fail-safe technique that guarantees against overcooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/24/dining/18pairrex/18pairrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "fennel, pistachio, white wine, wild salmon fillets, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium-size fennel bulbs", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "2 pounds king salmon fillet, skin on and pin bones removed", "Salt and ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons shelled unsalted pistachios, lightly toasted and coarsely chopped", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/2 cup dry white wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 500 degrees.
