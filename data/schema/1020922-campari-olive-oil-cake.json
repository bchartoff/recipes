{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Campari Olive Oil Cake", "description": "When I posted a photo of this very modest-looking cake on Instagram, I was blown away by the response. Honestly, it didn\u2019t look like much \u2014 a generic yellow cake with a golden top. I think just the very notion of putting Campari and olive oil in a cake is what made people stop and \u201clike\u201d it. And it is a pretty terrific flavor combination: The citrusy bittersweet character of the Campari goes really well with the fragrant oil, to which I also add melted butter for richness, as well as lots of fresh citrus juice and zest. On its own, the cake is a pretty plain-looking thing, but you can dress it up for a party, adding orange segments, berries and dollops of whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to the top. If you want to go one step further, simmer some Campari and a bit of sugar down to a syrup, and drizzle that all over the cake. It turns the cake more pink and accentuates its boozy flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/11/dining/06apperex-cake/merlin_169778610_1140169a-b49c-4357-b79c-ddd81f9f4a77-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "campari, grapefruit, lemon, olive oil, orange, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 447}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1 2/3 cups/330 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters whole milk", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters mild olive oil", "3 large eggs", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters Campari", "1 tablespoon grated grapefruit zest", "1 tablespoon grated orange zest", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters fresh grapefruit juice", "2 tablespoons fresh orange juice", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "Whipped cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or whipped cream, sweetened or not as you like, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
