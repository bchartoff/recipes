{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mexican Hot Dogs", "description": "If you\u2019ve ever walked through the streets of Los Angeles late at night, you may have been lucky enough to happen upon a street vendor selling bacon-wrapped hot dogs piled high with caramelized onions, saut\u00e9ed peppers, pico de gallo, avocado, ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise. This version of Mexican hot dogs, also known as street dogs or Los Angeles hot dogs, is believed to be a riff on a similar recipe that originated in Sonora, Mexico. In Los Angeles, they\u2019re sometimes fried on a mobile D.I.Y. griddle made with a wheeled cart, a large sheet pan and a heat source underneath, but we don\u2019t recommend trying that at home. For this recipe, a standard sheet pan and an oven will do.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kiera Wright-Ruiz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/dining/kwr-mexican-hot-dogs/kwr-mexican-hot-dogs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, barbecues", "keywords": "avocado, bacon, hot dogs, jalape\u00f1o, onion, pepper, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 168}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 hot dogs", "8 bacon strips", "4 jalape\u00f1os, stemmed, halved lengthwise and seeds removed\u00a0(optional)", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for drizzling (if needed)", "1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced", "1/2 small red bell pepper, thinly sliced", "1/2 small green bell pepper, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt", "8 hot dog buns", "Ketchup, yellow mustard and mayonnaise, for serving", "3 plum tomatoes, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 avocado, diced", "1/2 small red onion, diced (about 1/2 cup)", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
