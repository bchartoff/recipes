{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hot Brown", "description": "The Hot Brown was invented in 1926 at the Brown Hotel in Louisville, Ky., by the chef\u00a0Fred Schmidt.\u00a0The open-faced turkey sandwich, smothered in Mornay sauce and topped with bacon, was served to customers at late-night\u00a0 dances,\u00a0while the band was on its break. The dish has become a Louisville staple, one well suited for Derby Day or after Thanksgiving, when roast turkey is plentiful. Thick slices of bread, sold as Texas Toast in some parts of the United States, do not get lost under the meat and sauce. Hand-carved turkey is best for the dish; deli turkey slices do not deliver the same Hot Brown experience.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/29/dining/sb-hot-brown/merlin_153389007_463efdc9-d417-443b-b472-dec48a69f660-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, casseroles, poultry, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "bacon, bread, pecorino romano, tomato, turkey breast, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 159}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (8-inch) sandwich loaf (about 20 ounces), cut evenly into 8 slices, crust removed", "2 tomatoes, quartered", "1 pound roasted turkey breast, thickly sliced", "1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 cup whole milk", "1/2 cup shredded Pecorino Romano (about 1 1/2 ounces)", "Pinch of ground nutmeg", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "Shredded Pecorino Romano, for sprinkling", "8 slices crisp cooked bacon", "Chopped parsley, for garnish", "Paprika, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the sandwich:\u00a0Heat oven to 400 degrees.
