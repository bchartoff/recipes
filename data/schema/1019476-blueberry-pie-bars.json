{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry Pie Bars", "description": "At first glance, these bars may look like every other fruit crumble bar you\u2019ve had, but they have a secret. Between the jammy fruit and buttery shortbread is a bonus layer of sweetened cream cheese you never knew you needed until now. Wild blueberries are less watery than conventional blueberries and have a more concentrated blueberry flavor that works beautifully in this recipe. They are available frozen and need not be thawed before using, but you can use whichever variety you find. These bars will be delicious no matter what.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/16/dining/seneviratne-blueberry-pie-bars-horizontal/seneviratne-blueberry-pie-bars-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "blueberries, cream cheese, shortbread, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 403}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 297, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "198 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 2/3 ounces/300 grams shortbread cookies (2 5.3-ounce packages)", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 tablespoons/60 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted", "8 ounces/225 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "1/4 cup/50 grams plus 1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "3 cups/12 ounces/340 grams wild blueberries, fresh or frozen, but not thawed", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "Pinch of kosher salt", "5 1/3 ounces/150 grams shortbread cookies (1 5.3-ounce package)", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 large egg yolk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
