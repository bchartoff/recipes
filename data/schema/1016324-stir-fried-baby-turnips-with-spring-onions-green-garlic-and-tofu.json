{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Baby Turnips With Spring Onions, Green Garlic and Tofu", "description": "The fresh ginger I\u2019m finding at springtime farmers\u2019 markets is new and juicy, like the spring garlic and onions. I\u2019m sure this is going to be just one of many springtime stir-fries, but right now it\u2019s a favorite. It\u2019s inspired by an irresistible bunch of baby turnips I bought at a Sunday farmers\u2019 market. The turnips were no bigger than a small round radish, but their greens were lush \u2013 I had about 6 cups of leaves after I\u2019d stripped them from the stems. Sweet spring onions and green garlic contrast beautifully with the bitter flavor of the turnip greens. \n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/03/science/09recipehealth/09recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 3 (4 if there are other dishes)", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, vegan, vegetarian, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 200, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "498 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["7 ounces firm tofu (1/2 of a14-ounce box), drained and cut in dominoes (about 1/4-inch thick by 2 inches long) ", "1 bunch baby turnips, with greens (about 1 pound total)", "1 to 2 tablespoons soy sauce (to taste)", "1 tablespoon Chinese cooking sherry (Shaoxing rice wine) or dry sherry", "1/4 cup chicken stock, vegetable stock or water", "1 teaspoon honey or agave nectar", "2 tablespoons peanut, canola, rice bran, sunflower or grape seed oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 bulb green garlic, papery shells removed, minced", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1 bunch spring onions or 2 to 3 bunches scallions, sliced, white and light green parts only, sliced (about 1 1/4 cups)", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain and dry tofu slices on paper towels.
