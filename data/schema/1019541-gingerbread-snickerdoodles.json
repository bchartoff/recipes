It\u2019s a more nuanced version of winter gingerbread and a punchier take on snickerdoodles. If you\u2019re in a rush, you can bake the cookies without first chilling the dough. It\u2019ll be too soft to roll in the cinnamon sugar, but you can scoop the dough right onto the pan and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on top of the rounds. You won\u2019t get as even a coating, but will still get the crackle effect.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/04/dining/gingerbread-snickerdoodle/gingerbread-snickerdoodle-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "32 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 258}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 118, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "69 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon cream of tartar", "1 tablespoon ground ginger", "2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt<strong> </strong>", "<strong></strong>3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), at room temperature", "1/4 cup molasses", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, ginger, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
