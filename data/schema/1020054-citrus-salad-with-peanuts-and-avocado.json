The first step is to acquire a range of fruit \u2014 citrus of different colors, sizes and shapes, with varied levels of acidity and sweetness. Cutting the fruit so you don\u2019t lose too much juice is key: Cut the pith and peel with a knife, then slice the fruit horizontally with a sharp knife that doesn\u2019t crush and squeeze. A simple dressing of fish sauce, sweetened with a little brown sugar, works well, especially when it\u2019s offset with some fatty pieces of avocado and some fresh herbs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/25/magazine/03mag-eat-slideshow-slide-OZX8/03mag-eat-slideshow-slide-OZX8-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "avocado, blood orange, brown sugar, cilantro leaves, fish sauce, mint leaves, rice wine vinegar, shallot, tangerine, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 414}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 328, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1498 milligrams", "sugarContent": "30 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 blood oranges", "2 grapefruits", "2 tangerines", "1 ripe avocado", "1/4 cup fish sauce", "2 tablespoons packed light-brown sugar", "1 tablespoon rice-wine vinegar", "1 shallot, minced", "1 handful mint leaves", "1 handful cilantro leaves", "1/2 cup roasted, salted peanuts, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice off citrus tips on both sides using a sharp knife to create two flat surfaces.
