{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Raspberry Pavlova With Peaches and Cream", "description": "This Pavlova\u2019s meringue foundation has freeze-dried raspberry powder shot through it, tinting it pink and giving it a fruity, candy-like flavor. But if you can\u2019t get the freeze-dried berries, just leave them out. The meringue will still bake up with a shatteringly crisp shell and a marshmallow-like interior that makes an edible bowl for the whipped cream and fruit. If it\u2019s not humid out, the meringue shell can be baked up to a day ahead. Otherwise, it\u2019s best made the day you plan to serve it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/17/dining/12apperex1/merlin_157436331_015f2124-3052-45bf-a4cb-bb9ff89305b4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "parfaits and trifles, project", "keywords": "cream, freeze-dried raspberries, peach, raspberries, sour cream, vanilla bean, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 89}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups freeze-dried raspberries (1 1/3 ounces)", "6 large egg whites, at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/125 grams Demerara sugar", "1/2 vanilla bean, split", "2 (1 1/2-inch) strips lemon zest", "3 small (or 2 large) ripe peaches, pitted and sliced", "1/2 pint raspberries (1 cup)", "2 cups/480 milliliters heavy cream", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters sour cream", "1 1/2 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Tiny pinch of fine sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 250 degrees.
