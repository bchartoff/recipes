{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlic-Ginger Chicken Breasts With Cilantro and Mint", "description": "This chicken, which is the brainchild of my aunt Sonia, is legendary among our cousins. Until recently, though, no one knew what, exactly, went into it. Whenever my aunt would make it on a family vacation, she\u2019d disappear for a half-hour and reemerge with a Ziploc bag filled with the marinade and the chicken breasts. No one (not even her only daughter, Isha) was allowed to know the contents. The marinating chicken would smell so good, I\u2019d legitimately have thoughts about eating it raw, carpaccio-style (which is disgusting, I know!). Well, folks, I am here to tell you that, after much negotiation, I have finally pried that chicken recipe out of Sonia\u2019s hands. Both the marinade and the cooking method (low and sort of slow) feel ingenious to me, and the payoff is huge: Charred, spicy, slightly funky, juicy chicken that is equally wonderful by itself or rolled up in a roti, taco-style, and served with various salads and chutneys.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/dining/ml-garlic-ginger-chicken/merlin_152035974_1962c75f-a0c3-482b-8ad4-a9292cf6849c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "chicken breast, mango powder, mint, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 638}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 460, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "65 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "483 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint leaves, plus more for garnish", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)", "3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder), optional", "1/2 teaspoon red chile powder, like ground cayenne", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1/2 to 3/4 pound each)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the marinade: Add the garlic, ginger, mint, cilantro, lemon juice and 3 tablespoons oil to a large resealable bag.
