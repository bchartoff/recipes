{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Celeriac, Celery and Carrot Remoulade", "description": "When I lived in France I discovered c\u00e9leri r\u00e9moulade, the creamy grated salad made with celery root, mayonnaise or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or both, and mustard. It was a dish I always ordered when I saw it on caf\u00e9 menus, and brought home from French delis on a regular basis. This is inspired by the French salad, but it is not quite as creamy (or gloppy). However you can make it more so if you wish just by adding more cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, yogurt (healthier), or mayonnaise.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/14/science/recipehealthcelery/recipehealthcelery-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 49}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 165, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "480 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium celeriac, about 3/4 pound without stalks, peeled and grated (about 4 cups)", "6 ounces carrots, peeled and grated (about 2 cups)", "4 ounces celery, thinly sliced (about 1 1/8 cups)", "Salt", "2 tablespoons chopped chives", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley", "1/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons grapeseed oil", "1/4 cup Greek yogurt", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, to taste", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place celeriac, carrots and celery in a bowl or colander and salt generously.
