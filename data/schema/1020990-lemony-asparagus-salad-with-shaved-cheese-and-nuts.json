{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemony Asparagus Salad With Shaved Cheese and Nuts", "description": "Less is more when it comes to asparagus, especially those first tender stalks that show up in spring. Here they\u2019re quickly steamed and turned into an elegant salad tossed with a lemony, shallot dressing, and enriched with plenty of grated Manchego or other cheese. Chopped pistachios add another shade of green to the plate along with their sweet crunch, but use any nuts you like, or skip them entirely. This tangy, bright salad doesn\u2019t need them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/dining/03Apperex/merlin_171067614_d7155e6b-aa12-4374-9473-6a25c39d47f3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "asparagus, cheese, herbs, shallot, side dish, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup pistachios or other nuts", "1 pound asparagus, woody ends trimmed", "1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons soft herbs, such as dill, parsley and tarragon, or a combination", "3 tablespoons minced shallots, red onion or scallion", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (or cider vinegar)", "Large pinch of kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "3/4 cup coarsely grated cheese (1 1/2 ounces), preferably a young sheep\u2019s milk, such as pecorino or Manchego, but any firm cheese works, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
