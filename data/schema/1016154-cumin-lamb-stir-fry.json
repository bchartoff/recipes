{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cumin Lamb Stir-Fry", "description": "Fragrant, intense and full of fiery chile, this lamb stir-fry isn\u2019t for the timid eater. For the most authentic flavor, it\u2019s worth your while to seek out Sichuan peppercorns, which have a woodsy, tongue-numbing, camphor quality. (They are available at specialty spice markets, in Chinatown, or online.) You can substitute regular black peppercorns, but you won\u2019t get the same punch. If you\u2019re not a lamb-lover, you can also try this with lean beef. Serve this over white or brown rice to cut the heat, with a side of sliced cucumbers dressed with sesame oil and salt for freshness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/26/dining/26APPE_SPAN/26APPE_SPAN-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chilies, cumin, lamb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 644}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 851, "unsaturatedFatContent": "41 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "86 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "41 grams", "sodiumContent": "496 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds", "2 teaspoons Sichuan or regular peppercorns", "1 pound boneless lamb", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 to 8 dried red chiles (or substitute 1/2 teaspoon or more crushed red pepper)", "1 large white onion", "1 bunch (about 8) scallions, trimmed", "2 tablespoons peanut oil", "3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 1/2 tablespoons Chinese cooking sherry (Shaoxing rice wine) or dry sherry", "2 cups fresh cilantro, leaves and stems", "Rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast cumin seeds and peppercorns until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
