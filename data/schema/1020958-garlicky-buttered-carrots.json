{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlicky, Buttered Carrots", "description": "This is one of the few occasions when overcrowding the skillet is a good thing. These carrots are cooked in fat (schmaltz, olive oil, butter), with a pinch of something spicy (red-pepper flakes, cayenne, even hot paprika), sort of half-steaming on top of each other until just tender (no mushy carrots here, please). At the end, they are seasoned with a bit of finely grated or chopped garlic off the heat, which quiets the garlicky punchiness without extinguishing it entirely. Like a sandwich cut into triangles, the fact that the carrots are sliced into rounds makes them taste above-average delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/dining/30Romanrex4-carrots/30Romanrex4-carrots-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, vegetables", "keywords": "carrot, chicken fat, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 55}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup chicken fat, olive oil or unsalted butter", "1/4 cup olive oil\u00a0", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)\u00a0", "2 bunches carrots, topped removed (about 1 pound), thinly sliced into rounds", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\u00a0", "1 garlic clove, finely chopped or grated\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt chicken fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
