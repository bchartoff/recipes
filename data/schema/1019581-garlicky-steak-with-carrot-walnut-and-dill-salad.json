{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlicky Steak With Carrot, Walnut and Dill Salad", "description": "Any steak benefits from a quick marinade, but especially a flank steak. Fairly tender on its own, it becomes its best self when bathed in oil laced with lemon, garlic and coriander. The trick here is to set aside a teaspoon of this potent marinade to stir into yogurt, to dollop or serve alongside. This marinade and the garlic yogurt also work well on chicken or pork, tossed with almost any grilled vegetable or even drizzled over toast. The salad, made from long strips of carrots, is\u00a0a light, sophisticated side that's as at home on your\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0night table as it is at weekend brunch.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/dining/sc-flank-steak/sc-flank-steak-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, weeknight, steaks and chops", "keywords": "carrot, dill, steak, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 109}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 480, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "672 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 cup full-fat plain Greek yogurt", "1/3 cup olive oil", "1 1/4 pounds flank steak", "4 large carrots", "1/3 cup walnuts, toasted", "1/4 cup roughly chopped dill"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Zest the lemon and combine zest\u00a0in a bowl with 1 teaspoon salt, the pepper, garlic and coriander,\u00a0and rub with your fingers to make an even paste.
