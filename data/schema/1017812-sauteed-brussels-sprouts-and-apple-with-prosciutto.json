Thinly slicing the sprouts is faster, though less refined. The slivered sprouts are then saut\u00e9ed with cubes of sweet apples, and garnished with an icy, porky snow made from frozen prosciutto grated on a microplane. Grated pecorino cheese can be used instead for a meatless version.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/18/dining/18APPE3-WEB/18APPE3-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apple, brussels sprouts, prosciutto, fall, winter, gluten-free, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 216}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 126, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "352 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto (see note)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large Golden Delicious apples, cored and cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "1 1/2 pounds brussels sprouts, trimmed and very thinly sliced", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "3/4 teaspoon black pepper, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stack prosciutto slices on top of one another.
