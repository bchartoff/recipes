{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Angel Food Cake With Nectarines and Plums", "description": "The key to success with angel food cake is not overbeating the egg whites, which means you should never go above medium speed, and the peaks should fold over when you lift them with a spatula or beaters. If the meringue is too stiff, the cake will not maintain its height once baked. You should be able to pour the batter into the pan. Make sure that the egg whites are at room temperature before you begin. Use an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, preferably one with a removable bottom (even better if it has feet, for air circulation when you cool it upside down). Once baked, let it cool completely in the reversed pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/27/dining/27MARTHA-WEB/27MARTHA-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "almond extract, cake flour, egg whites, honey, nectarine, plum, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 52}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 202, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "98 milligrams", "sugarContent": "37 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/100 grams sifted cake or pastry flour", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams superfine sugar", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cups/350 grams/11 large egg whites, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon cream of tartar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (optional)", "2 pounds nectarines, pitted and sliced", "1 to 1 1/2\u00a0pounds red-fleshed plums (or plums and pluots), pitted and sliced", "3 tablespoons mild honey, such as clover or acacia", "2 to 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon fresh thyme or lemon thyme leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
