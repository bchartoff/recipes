{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaetzle", "description": "Expand the concept of pasta a bit, and you arrive at spaetzle, the quickly made and rather thin dough (somewhat akin to savory pancake batter) that is often \u201cgrated\u201d into boiling water on a spaetzle maker, a tool that looks like a grater without sharp edges. I find spaetzle makers unnervingly tricky, so I prefer to do what I've often seen done by Alsatians, for whom spaetzle is traditional: drop the batter by the spoonful into boiling water. As with all pasta, the more fragile the batter is, the lighter the result will be, so don't make it too stiff; just stiff enough to hold together.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/17/dining/17COOKING-SPATZLE2/17COOKING-SPATZLE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "austrian, german", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "butter, egg, flour, milk, parsley, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 225}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 401, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "386 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "2 cups flour", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more to taste", "3 eggs", "1 cup milk, more if needed", "2 to 4 tablespoons butter or olive oil", "Chopped fresh parsley or chives for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a large pot of water to a boil and salt it.
