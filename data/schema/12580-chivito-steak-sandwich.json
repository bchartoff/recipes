Pound out the beef \u2014 rib-eye or shell steak, tenderloin or flat-iron \u2014 then put it on a hot grill. It cooks fast. Then assemble: a small kaiser or Portuguese roll, with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise, some cheese and a slice of hard-cooked egg. Roasted peppers and grilled onions are welcome additions, and a spoonful of chimichurri salsa, freshly chopped, takes it over the top, but nicely. Figure on one or two per person.
