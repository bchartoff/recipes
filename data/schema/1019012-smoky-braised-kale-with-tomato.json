{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Braised Kale With Tomato", "description": "This is a hack of a preparation the chef Travis Lett used at his restaurant Gjelina in Venice, Calif., as a pairing for a half-roasted chicken. With its deeply caramelized base of tomato paste and smoked paprika, the kale melts into velvety excellence that can stand on its own with a pile of rice or a baked potato. But it really shines brightly as a supporting player in a feast of poultry, pork or beef. Do two onions seem too many for you? Use one. This is a recipe really to make your own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/26/dining/26COOKING-KALE2/26COOKING-KALE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "kale, tomato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 325}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 162, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "581 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 Spanish onions, peeled and diced", "8 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced", "1/4 cup tomato paste", "1 teaspoon hot smoked paprika (piment\u00f3n)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "3 cups turkey or chicken stock, ideally homemade or low-sodium", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, plus more to taste", "4 (3/4-pound) bunches washed kale (any kind), thick stems discarded or cut into thin strips, leaves cut into thick strips (about 16 packed cups total)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large, heavy-bottomed, high-sided pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add olive oil.
