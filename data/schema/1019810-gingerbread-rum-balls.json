{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gingerbread Rum Balls", "description": "This is the perfect recipe to make if you\u2019ve got crumbs leftover after building a gingerbread house. Or you can use a package of gingersnaps ground up in the food processor or blender. The flavor of rum balls improves after they sit for a couple of days, so plan ahead if you\u2019re considering these for a holiday bash. They will last for two weeks or even longer if you store them airtight at room temperature. Rolling rum balls in confectioners\u2019 sugar gives you a soft, moist confection while using granulated sugar results in a crunchier texture. And if you\u2019d rather skip the alcohol, you can substitute orange or apple juice for the rum. Just reduce the confectioners\u2019 sugar by a tablespoon or two, to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/12/dining/12apperex1/merlin_147679470_33185d01-06fe-414e-ac64-3aa7d6ae6a69-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 2 1/2 dozen balls", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert, gingerbread, pecans, rum, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 108, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "64 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/360 grams cookie crumbs, from gingerbread or gingersnaps", "1 1/4 cups/125 grams pecans", "3/4 cup/85 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more for rolling if you like", "1/3 cup/80\u00a0milliliters dark or amber rum, brandy or bourbon, more as needed", "2 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup", "2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "Pinch fine sea salt", "Granulated sugar, for rolling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together cookie crumbs and pecans until nuts are coarsely ground.
