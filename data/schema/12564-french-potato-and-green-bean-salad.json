{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "French Potato and Green Bean Salad", "description": "If this sounds like a pared-down salade ni\u00e7oise, it is. Make a bold vinaigrette that is unapologetically fragrant with garlic and anchovy. Boil medium-size potatoes in their skins. Peel, slice and dress them while they are still slightly warm. You can even do the work in advance and then assemble it all just before serving. Authentic, traditional or somewhere in between, maybe we\u2019ll just call this a potato salad with a southern French accent and let it go at that.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/27/dining/27KITCH_SPAN/27KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "arugula, green beans, potato, dairy-free, gluten-free, nut-free, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1098}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 307, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "681 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds medium potatoes, like Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn", "Salt and pepper", "1 bay leaf", "1 large thyme sprig", "3 garlic cloves, smashed to a paste with a little salt", "1 tablespoon chopped anchovy", "1 tablespoon chopped capers", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "4 tablespoons white wine vinegar", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1 pound small French beans, or small romano or wax beans", "4 large eggs", "1 tablespoon thinly sliced chives", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped basil", "6 to 8 anchovy fillets, optional, for garnish", "8 ounces arugula, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
