{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mixed Bean Salad With Pickled Ginger", "description": "Nostalgia aside, classic three-bean salads are not much to write home about. They are traditionally composed of red kidney beans, garbanzo beans and sad soft green beans, all from cans, and heavy on vinegar and sugar. That\u2019s fine for camping or during a power outage. Here\u2019s a better bean salad that takes advantage of fresh beans \u2014 and fresh shelling beans \u2014 in season. Lightly dressed with a Japanese-inspired vinaigrette and sparked with pickled ginger, it\u2019s a most delicious departure from the ordinary. You don\u2019t have to make your own pickled ginger, but it\u2019s an easy, fun project.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/27/dining/27KITCH/27KITCH-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "beans, dijon mustard, lime, miso, rice wine vinegar, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 207, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "981 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Juice of 2 limes (about 4 tablespoons)", "2 tablespoons white miso", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon brown sugar", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "1/4 cup mild vegetable oil, such as safflower or peanut", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "1 1/2 cups raw fresh shelling beans, such as cranberry beans, butter beans or black-eyed peas, from about 2 pounds beans in the pod (may substitute frozen edamame or baby lima beans)", "2 pounds small green beans, yellow wax beans and Romano beans, or a single type, topped and tailed", "4 scallions, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons julienned pickled ginger (see note)", "2 teaspoons toasted black sesame seeds, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the vinaigrette:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, put lime juice, miso, mustard, rice wine vinegar and brown sugar.
