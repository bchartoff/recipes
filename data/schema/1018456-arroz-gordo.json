{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arroz Gordo", "description": "Arroz gordo, or fat rice from Macau, is reminiscent of paella, which is no surprise considering that Macau was a colony of Portugal, a country that shares many culinary traditions with its Iberian neighbor, Spain. Here, deliciously seasoned rice is studded with bits of duck and sausage and a host of other savory ingredients, all seasoned with a nod to Asia.\n\nMany of the components of this recipe can be prepared separately ahead of time and refrigerated, and in the case of the chicken, up to a week in advance and frozen. All that is needed is a quick reheat and last-minute assembly.\n\nThis recipe calls for chicken, pork, sausage, clams and shrimp, but feel free to make substitutions. Plump mussels would be a fine stand-in for the clams, and you could even purchase Chinese roast pork to skip the step of roasting your own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/07/dining/07ENTERTAINING1/07ENTERTAINING1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P2D", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese, portuguese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "chicken, clams, croutons, duck confit, eggs, olives, pork, rice, sausage, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup golden raisins", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1 cup plain croutons", "4 tablespoons duck fat or chicken fat", "1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium-large onion, slivered", "1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded and slivered", "Salt and pepper", "1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1/2 tablespoon tomato paste", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "2 prepared duck confit legs and thighs, available in many food stores and online", "4 scallions, cut in 2-inch lengths", "1 4-inch piece fresh ginger, sliced thin", "3 cups jasmine rice", "1/2 cup chicken stock", "Glazed Pork (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018465-glazed-pork\">see recipe</a>)", "Turmeric Chicken (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018466-turmeric-chicken\">see recipe</a>)", "1 pound lingui\u00e7a sausage, sliced", "Chile Shrimp (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018467-chile-shrimp\">see recipe</a>)", "Garlic Clams (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018468-garlic-clams\">see recipe</a>)", "4 hard-cooked eggs, halved", "1 cup pitted green olives, preferably Portuguese", "3 lemons, quartered", "3 scallions, slivered on a slant, including green part", "Chile powder, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place raisins, 1/2 cup of the vinegar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan.
