At 8 minutes, pull the pasta from the boiling water with tongs, let it briefly drip its excess water above the pasta pot, but then place it right into the garlic-chile-oil pan, letting the last drips of water go right into the sauce."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn up the heat under the pasta now and stir vigorously, also tossing the pasta with short sturdy flicks of your wrist, for just about a minute, listening to the water hiss a little as it evaporates in the oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn off the heat, add cheese and a lot of black pepper.
