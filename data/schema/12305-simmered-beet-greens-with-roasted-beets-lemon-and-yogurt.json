If you want to make a meal of this, serve the greens and beets with a whole grain, like barley or quinoa. The authentic dish includes much more olive oil than this one. If the beets you find at the farmers' market or the store don\u2019t have a generous bunch of greens attached, ask the vendor or the head of the produce department for greens they have cut away for other customers. They\u2019ve probably got a box full of them in the back.
