I serve it on its own, as a side dish, as the base for a risotto and a filling for a pie, taco and quesadilla, as a sauce for pasta and an omelet filling. You can make it with all wild mushrooms for a splurge, with some wild mushrooms, or with a mix of cultivated oyster mushrooms (much less expensive than wild mushrooms like chanterelles) and button or creminis. Make this big batch and use it for lots of other dishes throughout the week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/17/science/16recipehealth/16recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 629}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 93, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "357 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce (about 1 cup) dried mushrooms, preferably porcinis", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 shallots or 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 pound white or cremini mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed, and quartered or sliced 1/2 inch thick", "1 pound wild mushrooms, trimmed and brushed clean, or oyster mushrooms, trimmed and torn into pieces if very large", "Salt to taste", "2 teaspoons all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup dry white wine such as sauvignon blanc or pinot grigio", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 to 4 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the dried mushrooms in a pyrex measuring cup or a bowl and pour on 2 cups boiling water.

Cook until the mushrooms begin to sweat, then add a generous pinch of salt. Stir for about 5 minutes over medium-high heat as the mushrooms continue to soften and sweat.
