{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey and Noodles", "description": "This comforting family recipe belongs to Whitney Reynolds, a New Yorker with roots in Tennessee. She traditionally serves the dish of thickened turkey broth and noodle-shaped dumplings as a side at her Thanksgiving dinner, next to the roasted bird and mashed potatoes. The yolk-rich noodles, rolled and cut with a knife, are dried out for some hours at room temperature. That way, they become strong enough to withstand a long boil during which they soak up the flavors of the roasted turkey stock, going tender and sticky-edged. The stock reduces, until it's somewhere between soup and gravy. Ms. Reynolds, a noodle purist, would never put turkey meat in the dish, but the day after Thanksgiving, when there's often a little left over, it's hard to imagine a better place for it to end up. Consider it optional.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/22/dining/22LEFTOVERSJP1/22LEFTOVERSJP1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas", "keywords": "heavy cream, turkey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 593, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1354 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon salt", "6 egg yolks", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted but cool", "1/4 cup heavy cream", "8 cups\u00a0turkey broth (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013935-turkey-broth\">see recipe</a>)", "1 cup roasted, shredded turkey meat (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt.
