{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Belly Tea Sandwiches", "description": "These sandwiches are not dainty pinkie-in-the-air nibbles, but hefty pork belly tea sandwiches that cater to hearty appetites and cold beer. Zak Pelaccio, the chef and an owner of Fatty Crab, a Malaysian street food cafe on the edge of the meatpacking district, got the idea for them from the afternoon English tea services he enjoyed when he lived in Malaysia. \n\nWith each bite the sandwiches offer richness, salt and spice, the components that make game day food so satisfying. Southeast Asian chili sauce, two kinds of soy sauce and streaky pork fat heighten the taste.\n\nAnd they are a cinch to make. Just marinate, braise then pile the meat onto big slices of dense supermarket white bread that have been slathered with spicy mayonnaise. They can be made in advance and wrapped and refrigerated for a couple of hours before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/24/dining/pork-belly-tea-sandwiches/pork-belly-tea-sandwiches-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "12 sandwiches, 36 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "malaysian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sandwiches", "keywords": "chinese black vinegar, pork belly, scallion, sweet soy sauce, thai chili paste, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 333, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1041 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cup sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)", "4 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar", "2 tablespoons dark soy sauce", "2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce", "Juice of 1 lime", "1 2-pound piece fresh pork belly, with skin", "2 bunches scallions", "Salt", "\u00bd cup rice vinegar", "1 \u00bd cups mayonnaise", "1 clove garlic, put through a press", "2 teaspoons Thai chili paste (sambal oelek) or sriracha (chili sauce)", "24 slices thick white bread", "24 large sprigs cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, combine kecap manis, black vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce and lime juice.
