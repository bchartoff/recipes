{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Matzo Ball Soup a la Mexicana", "description": "The chef Fany Gerson\u2019s spicy, dynamic take on a classic matzo ball soup is a staple of her Rosh Hashana table. The broth gets a bright kick from green chiles, cilantro and garlic; the matzo balls are blended with onions and fresh herbs (use an extra-large pot to prevent the balls from overcrowding); and the finished soup is garnished with even more onions, chiles and cilantro, plus avocado and lime for freshness and color. The broth calls for two chickens, even though you use the meat from only one of the chickens shredded in the soup. Ms. Gerson says using two chickens boosts the flavor of the broth, and you can use the meat from the second one the following day for enchiladas or tacos.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/05/dining/05Fanyrex1/merlin_141928068_2e9e168d-af3f-40b2-b5a8-93848b90f519-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken, matzo meal, serrano pepper", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 114}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 chickens (2 1/2 to 3 pounds each), or 1 chicken (4 to 5 pounds), plus 8 whole chicken wings", "4 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks", "3 celery stalks, cut into chunks", "1 1/2 medium white onions, peeled and quartered", "1 to 2 Serrano peppers, sliced lengthwise", "1 leek, split lengthwise and cut into chunks", "1 large garlic clove, peeled", "8 sprigs cilantro", "8 sprigs flat-leaf parsley", "2 bay leaves", "About 6 black peppercorns", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1 1/4 cups matzo meal", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "5 large eggs, 3 of them separated", "1/3 cup grated white onion, squeezed in a dish towel to remove excess liquid", "1/4 cup rendered chicken or duck fat, or use vegetable oil", "3 tablespoons finely minced herbs, such as dill, flatleaf parsley or chives, or a combination", "1 small white onion, peeled and finely chopped", "2 Serrano peppers (or 1 jalape\u00f1o pepper), seeded and finely chopped", "1 cup chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 to 2 avocados, diced", "3 to 4 limes, cut into wedges", "1 sprig fresh epazote"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the broth: Place all the ingredients except the salt in a large soup pot and fill with cold water to cover by 1 inch.
