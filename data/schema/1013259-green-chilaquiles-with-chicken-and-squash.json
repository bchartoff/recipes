Stir in the stock, bring to a simmer and simmer 10 minutes, stirring often. Add the summer squash and simmer, stirring often, until tender, about 10 minutes. The sauce should coat the front and back of your spoon. Stir in the chicken and heat through. Taste and adjust seasoning. Just before serving bring to a simmer and stir in the tortilla chips. Garnish with the yogurt or cheese, sliced radishes and chopped cilantro. Serve at once."}]}
