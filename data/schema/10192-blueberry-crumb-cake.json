A host expecting weekend guests should shop ahead and, well before guests arrive, prepare the recipes that will keep, saving the most perishable for the last minute. Take this cake that Molly O\u2019Neill brought into The Times in 1993, a confection that can play dessert as well as breakfast. As a dessert, slices of the cake can be garnished with whipped cream, a compote of fresh berries or ice cream. For breakfast, slices can be toasted and served with butter, fresh ricotta or marscapone, or warmed in the oven and served with fresh fruit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "blueberries, dessert, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 410, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "315 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in pieces", "1/2 cup unsalted butter at room temperature, plus additional for greasing pan", "1 cup sugar", "2 eggs", "1/2 cup milk", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 cups blueberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
