This take, which Pierre Franey brought to The Times in 1987 as part of his 60-Minute Gourmet column, will not. It is not much different \u2013 and no more difficult \u2013 than your standard broccoli saut\u00e9 except for the addition of anchovies. If that word normally frightens you, fear not. Here, they are barely detectable as such, but provide a complex salinity that salt alone cannot. You'll never eat boring broccoli again.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/16/dining/16COOKING-BROCCOLIANDANCHOVIES1/16COOKING-BROCCOLIANDANCHOVIES1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "anchovy paste, broccoli, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 545}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 144, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "381 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch of broccoli, about 1 1/4 pounds", "Salt to taste", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 teaspoon finely minced garlic", "1/4 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon anchovy paste or 4 anchovies, smashed into a paste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut off the broccoli tops into individual florets.
