(Get a friend to send you some, or order them online.)\u00a0But you can also make it throughout the year using frozen or canned green chiles. Though pork, beef or lamb are more traditional for green chile stew, this chicken version is a bit lighter, quicker to cook and still packs a punch. It\u2019s not a dish for the faint of heart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/dining/06kitchenrex/06kitchenrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken, green chili, potato, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 393}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, legs, or a cut-up whole chicken (about 3 pounds)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil or lard", "Flour, for dredging", "1 medium yellow onion, diced", "3 large garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground", "1 cup chopped roasted New Mexico green chile, fresh or frozen and thawed", "3 cups chicken stock or water", "2 large potatoes, peeled, cut in 1-inch cubes", "3 large carrots, peeled, cut in 2-inch slices", "3 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons cold water (optional)", "Chopped cilantro, for garnish", "Warm flour or corn tortillas, for serving", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken thighs generously with salt and pepper.
