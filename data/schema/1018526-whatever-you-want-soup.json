Mix and match ingredients to suit your cravings, using an aromatic base of onions and garlic, seasonings, flavorful stock (or water), and whatever main ingredients you choose. This recipe, like a similar one in Julia Turshen's cookbook \"Small Victories,\" highlights soup's basic transformative qualities.

Covered in the refrigerator, it will last for up to five days, but it also freezes exceptionally well for up to two months.
