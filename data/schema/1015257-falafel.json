{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Falafel", "description": "You shouldn\u2019t reject deep-frying at home; I do it about once a month. It can be fast and easy, and you can deep-fry plants. (And anything else.)\n\nFrying is thought of as messy, but this can be mitigated by the simplest of measures: using a pot that is heavy, broad and deep, like a well-made stockpot. Choose this, add a fair amount of oil, and the process is simplified and neat.\n\nAdd your food in batches and don\u2019t crowd; you do not want the temperature to plummet, nor do you want the pieces of food nestling against one another. (Though it\u2019s fine if they bump.) You may or may not have to turn the pieces, but that\u2019s easy, because they\u2019ll be floating and they won\u2019t stick. Remove them with a slotted spoon, tongs or spider; you\u2019ll know when they\u2019re done because the color will be evenly gorgeous.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/23/dining/23JPFLEX2/23JPFLEX2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, chickpea", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 599}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 243, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "179 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups dried chickpeas or 1 cup dried chickpeas plus 3/4 cup dried split fava beans", "2 cloves garlic, lightly crushed", "1/2 onion, quartered", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "Scant teaspoon cayenne, or to taste; or mild chile powder to taste", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley or cilantro leaves", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste", "Neutral oil, like grapeseed or canola, for deep-frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put beans in a large bowl and cover with water by 3 to 4 inches \u2014 they will triple in volume as they soak.
