Orange is a flavor that complements sweet potatoes, and the walnut oil contributes a subtle background nuttiness. Make sure to stir the mixture every 15 minutes as it bakes, so that the sweet potatoes on the top layer don\u2019t dry out. The apple and pear slices may fall apart, but that\u2019s fine, they won\u2019t disintegrate and they\u2019ll contribute wonderful flavor to the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/02/science/01wellrecipe/01wellrecipe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, kosher, vegetarian, fall, orange, sweet potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 36}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 216, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "621 milligrams", "sugarContent": "21 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced about 1/4 inch thick", "2 tart apples, such as Pink Lady, peeled, cored, and sliced", "1 large ripe but firm pear, peeled, cored and sliced", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons mild honey, such as clover (substitute agave nectar for vegans)", "2 tablespoons walnut oil, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 teaspoons finely chopped or grated orange zest", "2 1/2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
