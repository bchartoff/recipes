{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame, Date and Banana Cake", "description": "Even though this cake is packed full of dates, bananas and tahini (also known as tahini paste in Britain), it\u2019s surprisingly soft and light. You can serve it warm, if you like, with the tahini cream cheese and bananas alongside, although it\u2019s worth the wait, if you can, for it to cool so that it can be assembled as a cake. A note on tahini: We always use tahini from one of the Arabic brands, which tend to be creamy and nutty (as opposed to a Greek or Cypriot tahini, which can be bitter and sticky). But it's also worth seeking out local or artisanal brands closer to home. Always be sure your tahini is well stirred before measuring.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/07/dining/07BAKING1/07BAKING1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "banana, cream cheese, dates, mascarpone, tahini, toasted sesame seeds, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 356}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 564, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "329 milligrams", "sugarContent": "38 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons/50 grams tahini", "1/3 cup/75 milliliters orange juice (from 1 large orange)", "5 ounces/140 grams medjool dates, pitted and quartered (about 8 dates)", "2 to 3 very ripe peeled bananas (8 ounces/240 grams), thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature and cut into 3/4-inch/2-centimeter pieces, plus extra butter for the pan", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated or superfine sugar (caster sugar)", "2 large eggs, beaten", "1 2/3 cup/200 grams all-purpose flour (plain flour), sifted", "2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/130 grams cream cheese, preferably at room temperature", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/130 grams mascarpone cheese, preferably at room temperature", "3 tablespoons/35 grams lightly packed light brown sugar (soft sugar)", "3 1/2 tablespoons/55 grams tahini", "1 ripe peeled banana, cut into 1/2-inch/1-centimeter-thick slices", "1 tablespoon Demerara sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons date syrup, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit/200 degrees Celsius.
