{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orange Creamsicle Ice Cream Cake", "description": "Refreshing and citrusy yet creamy and sweet, this stunning dessert is just like a Creamsicle, but in grown-up cake form. It\u2019s also incredibly easy: Simply stack spoonfuls of vanilla ice cream and orange sherbet into a springform pan and smoosh them down as you go. As for the crust, use whole vanilla wafers; They're less work, and crunchier than if you used crumbs. There are many ways to riff on this cake. You could try a different sherbet flavor, use frozen yogurt instead of vanilla ice cream, or trade the vanilla wafers for gingersnaps, shortbread or any other crumbly cookie. You could also add salted caramel, jam, nuts or pomegranate molasses in between the layers of ice cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/22/dining/as-creamsicle-ice-cream-cake/as-creamsicle-ice-cream-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H20M", "recipeYield": "Makes one 8-inch-round cake (8 to 10 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, cakes, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dessert, ice cream, sherbet, vanilla wafers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 503}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 quart (2 pints) orange sherbet or sorbet", "1 quart (2 pints) vanilla ice cream", "20 vanilla wafers (about 2 1/2 ounces/70 grams), plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Uncover the orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the crust.
