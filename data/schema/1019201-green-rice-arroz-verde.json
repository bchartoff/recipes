This recipe toasts the rice in oil first, then seasons it with a pur\u00e9e of onion, poblano, jalape\u00f1os and herbs. For a more complex dish, replace the cooking water with chicken stock or vegetable stock, and serve it with a side of soupy black beans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/21/dining/00RICEGUIDE10/00RICEGUIDE10-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "cilantro, parsley, poblano pepper, white rice, dairy-free, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 125}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 164, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "439 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup long-grain white rice, such as jasmine", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1/2 cup roughly chopped white onion (about half a small onion)", "1/2 cup roughly chopped poblano pepper, stemmed and seeded (about half a large poblano)", "1 jalape\u00f1o, stemmed, seeded and roughly chopped", "2 cloves garlic, peeled", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves", "1/4 cup parsley leaves", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 1/4 cups chicken stock or water", "1 lime, halved, to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the rice a few times, until the water that drains from it runs almost completely clear.
