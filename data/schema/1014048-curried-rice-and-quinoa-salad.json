{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Curried Rice and Quinoa Salad", "description": "For a salad to make a meal, it should contain something more substantial, like grains, beans or potatoes, or protein-rich ingredients like cheese, fish or eggs. Poach an egg, place it atop a generous serving of fris\u00e9e salad tossed with croutons, herbs and a tart vinaigrette, and you\u2019ve got lunch or a light dinner. A spinach salad with green beans can be transformed into a comforting and nourishing meal when warm potatoes tossed with vinaigrette and feta are added to the mix. I\u2019ve made this mixed-grains salad using both regular brown rice and brown basmati rice. I like the lightness of the basmati brown rice, but I also enjoy the chewiness of regular brown rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/01/04/health/04recipehealth_60/04recipehealth_60-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves six", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "healthy, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 182, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "321 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup basmati brown rice, or 1 cup regular long grain or short grain brown rice, cooked", "1/2 cup quinoa, preferably red quinoa, cooked", "1/4 cup toasted almonds, coarsely chopped", "1 large stalk celery, diced", "1 apple, cored, cut in small dice and tossed with 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt or buttermilk", "2 tablespoons Hellmann\u2019s or Best Foods Mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "Pinch of cayenne", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "1/2 pound broccoli florets, steamed for four or five minutes and refreshed with cold water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all of the salad ingredients."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together the yogurt or buttermilk, mayonnaise, lime juice, Dijon mustard, curry powder, cayenne and salt to taste.
