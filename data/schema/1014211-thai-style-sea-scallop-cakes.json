Kaffir lime leaf is used in many dishes throughout Southeast Asia and Indonesia (the limes are also known as makruts, but in South Africa, \u201ckaffir\u201d is a racial insult). It provides the unique floral, citrusy flavor. The lime leaf is not absolutely necessary in this recipe, but it\u2019s a bit of a pity to leave it out. The leaves are available, if not from your local Asian grocery, then online (try kaffirlimeleaves.com). Most tod mun recipes call for any white-fleshed fish, but this recipe calls for sea scallops, which give the cakes a wonderful texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/02/dining/02KITCH1_SPAN/02KITCH1_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, sea scallop, white fish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 37}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 129, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "628 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup rice wine vinegar", "1/4 cup brown sugar", "2 or 3 tiny Thai chiles, red or green, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons chopped or crushed roasted unsalted peanuts", "2 teaspoons fish sauce", "1 teaspoon grated ginger", "1 pound sea scallops, or 1/2 pound sea scallops plus 1/2 pound halibut, cod or other firm white-fleshed fish", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon black or white pepper", "2 teaspoons fish sauce", "2 small garlic cloves, smashed to a paste with a little salt", "1 two-inch piece ginger, peeled and grated", "6 scallions, thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons finely chopped serrano or jalape\u00f1o chile, or to taste", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped", "4 kaffir lime leaves, slivered thinly", "1 small egg, lightly beaten", "Peanut or coconut oil for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the dipping sauce, combine all ingredients in a small bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the sea scallop cakes, put the sea scallops in the bowl of a food processor.
