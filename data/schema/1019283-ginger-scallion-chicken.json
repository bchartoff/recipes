A dash of soy sauce provides saltiness and depth, while a full cup of cilantro leaves, used as garnish, makes the dish a bit lighter and fresher. Fire seekers can add a sliced chile or two along with the ginger.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/02/dining/02Appetite1/02Appetite1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, weeknight", "keywords": "chicken thighs, cilantro, ginger, scallion, soy sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1372}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 376, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "852 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large scallions, trimmed", "1/4 cup peanut oil, or neutral oil such as grapeseed or sunflower, more as necessary", "1 3/4 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, as needed", "1 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 (2 1/2-inch) piece ginger, cut into thin matchsticks (about 3 tablespoons)", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "Large pinch sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the scallions in quarters lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1 1/2-inch-long pieces.
