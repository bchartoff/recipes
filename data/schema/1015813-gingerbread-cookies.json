Isabelle Steinhauer would bake between \u201c15 and 20 varieties each season: cream cheese wreaths shot from a cookie press; papery wafers carefully dipped in colored sugar; elaborate cutout cookies of nursery rhyme characters, their eyes fashioned from metallic drag\u00e9es that the F.D.A. has written off as inedible; all manner of confections with nuts.\u201d There's nothing fancy about these gingerbread cookies, but they are tender, gently spiced (feel free to add more to taste) and completely wonderful with a glass of cold milk. If you don't like using shortening, some readers have had good luck using half solid coconut oil and half softened butter instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jennifer Steinhauer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/20/dining/gingerbread-cookies/gingerbread-cookies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy, lunch", "keywords": "cinnamon, clove, ginger, gingerbread, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 677}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 149, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "132 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup light brown sugar", "1 cup light molasses", "1 cup vegetable shortening", "1 tablespoon baking soda", "1 egg, lightly beaten", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 tablespoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "4 to 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, more for rolling dough", "Royal icing and cinnamon candies, for decorating, optional."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar, molasses and shortening.
