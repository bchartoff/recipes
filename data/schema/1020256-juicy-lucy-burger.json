{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Juicy Lucy Burger", "description": "This Minneapolis staple is smart and simple: Sealing a slice of cheese inside two thin burger patties allows the burger to develop a serious char while the inside stays moist thanks to its molten core. There\u2019s debate over whether the burger originated at <a href=\"https://www.5-8club.com/\">5-8 Club</a> or\u00a0<a href=\"http://mattsbar.com/\">Matt\u2019s Bar</a>; both have drawn locals and tourists alike since the 1950s. The Juicy Lucy method takes some practice \u2014 you\u2019ll need to make sure the edges of the stacked patties are properly sealed so that the melted cheese gushes out with every bite instead of making a mess in the skillet \u2014 but the results far outweigh the challenge. Because the ingredient list is short (an unassuming bun, a smattering of pickles and a pile of caramelized onions), you\u2019ll need to season with abandon. You may be tempted to use an expensive craft cheese, but sliced American cheese is the only way to go for tradition and meltability.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/28/dining/aw-juicy-lucy/merlin_155376636_378e2718-b79c-4661-9979-0f73ecb8ec62-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 burgers", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers", "keywords": "American cheese, ground beef, onion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 212}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds ground beef, at least 15 percent fat", "4 slices American cheese", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large yellow onion (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into 1/4-inch rounds", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 to 2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil", "4 potato rolls or soft hamburger buns, split", "Bread-and-butter pickles, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, stir together 2 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper.
