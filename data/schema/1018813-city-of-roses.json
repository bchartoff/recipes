{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "City of Ros\u00e9s", "description": "This drink, from Jackrabbit at the Duniway restaurant in Portland, Ore., calls for an assertive ros\u00e9 as its base, and rightly so: The combination of ingredients tilts the drink toward serious cocktail territory. The ros\u00e9 defines it, and the herbal notes contributed by the other sprits give it character. Serve it on the rocks if you prefer. (The name is a play on City of Roses, as Portland is sometimes known; the wine the restaurant uses is from Division Winemaking Company, in the city.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/28/dining/28COCKTAILS4/28COCKTAILS4-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cynar, ros\u00e9, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 9}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "4 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces ros\u00e9 wine, preferably ros\u00e9 of gamay, chilled", "1 ounce Cynar artichoke liqueur", "1 ounce Dolin blanc vermouth", "Strip of lemon peel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine ingredients in a cocktail shaker or mixing glass and stir well.
