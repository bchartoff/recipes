Over the years, I tinkered with that and a similar version by Marion Cunningham. As my daughters learned to cook, they experimented a bit further. But we never really strayed from the originals. As long as you keep the flour to a minimum and don't add chemical leavening like baking powder, you will produce a true and beautiful brownie.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/dining/mb-brownies/mb-brownies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "About 1 dozen brownies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 966}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 207, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "13 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces unsweetened chocolate", "8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted or unsalted butter, more for greasing pan", "1 cup sugar", "2 eggs", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "Pinch salt if you use unsalted butter", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
