The cost of the cut may seem like a lot to pay for a piece of meat, but if it\u2019s local and well raised, with better flavor, texture and karma than cheaper commodity beef, it\u2019s worth it for a table of four. You might think sauce is overkill with a rib-eye like this, but playing steakhouse chef means dreaming up the accompanying sauces that you would most like to see on the table. My favorite is what I call \u2018\u2018<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017619-blue-butter\">blue butter</a>,\u2019\u2019 a blend of blue cheese and butter.\n\nIf blue cheese isn't your thing, try <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017620-creamed-spinach-sauce\">creamed spinach sauce</a>, <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017621-chile-chimichurri\">chile chimichurri</a>, <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017622-tomato-nam-prik\">tomato nam prik</a> or <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017623-bourbon-balsamic-syrup\">bourbon balsamic syrup</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/16/magazine/16eat1/16mag-16eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "barbecue", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops", "keywords": "main course, steak", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 151}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 636, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "51 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "661 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "3 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bone-in rib-eye, 2 to 3 inches thick (about 2 1/2 pounds)", "Salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking so that one section of the grate is quite hot and there is no heat under the other part.

If you want truly rare, remove the steak when its interior measures 125 degrees, or even a little bit less; for medium-rare, 135 degrees is about right.
