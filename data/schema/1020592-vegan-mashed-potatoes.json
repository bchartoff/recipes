{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Mashed Potatoes", "description": "If you think cream and butter are required to make amazing mashed potatoes, then this recipe might surprise you. It calls for Yukon Gold potatoes, which are naturally creamier than russets and need only to be mashed with a little of their cooking water to become rich and fluffy. Sizzling shallots in a generous amount of olive oil infuses the oil with flavor before it\u2019s swirled into the potatoes. The finished mash is topped with the crispy shallots for a delightful, savory crunch. You could also <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019746-roasted-garlic-and-white-bean-dip-with-rosemary\">fry a rosemary sprig</a> in the same oil, or skip it and just add several pats of vegan butter. Whatever you do, remember to season the mashed potatoes generously. Mashed potatoes need lots of salt, especially those without dairy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/05/dining/as-vegan-mashed-potatoes/merlin_163577766_0022d377-9fa7-4e99-8dd8-64cf841bcd0a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, olive oil, shallot, yukon gold potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 43}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup olive oil", "1 large shallot, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced lengthwise", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch pieces.
