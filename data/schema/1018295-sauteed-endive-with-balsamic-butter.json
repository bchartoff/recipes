{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saut\u00e9ed Endive With Balsamic Butter", "description": "Searing the endives so they retain some crispness, then topping them with balsamic butter, gives this dish, adapted from the cookbook \"Eat in My Kitchen\" by Meike Peters, its panache. Because it\u2019s hard to make less balsamic butter than is called for, you wind up with enough for about a dozen endives, not just three; the endives portion of the recipe can be easily expanded to match, making this a great dish for entertaining. Or, use the leftover butter to top fish, roasted carrots and such. The butter keeps well in the refrigerator but should be used at room temperature; heating may cause it to break down.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28ENTERTAINING2/28ENTERTAINING2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "for two, quick, vegetables", "keywords": "balsamic vinegar, butter, endive, marjoram, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 91}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 124, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "147 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "3 medium-small heads Belgian endive, trimmed, halved vertically", "Fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons good-quality balsamic vinegar", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, in small pieces", "Pinch of sugar", "Coarsely ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons fresh marjoram or oregano leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a heavy skillet.
