{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheese Enchiladas With Chili Gravy", "description": "Here is a recipe adapted from one that the great Tex-Mex scholar and restaurateur Robb Walsh serves at his El Real Tex-Mex restaurant in Houston. You can find similar ones served all over South Texas, often served with rice and refried beans. I think it\u2019s an excellent side dish for a cookout of grilled chicken or pork, but you could also slide a few fried eggs over the top and call it breakfast, or don't and use vegetable stock or water, and call it a vegetarian supper. Make sure to leave some bare tortilla peeking out on each side of the gravy and cheese so it grows crackly and awesome.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/01/dining/0601ENCHILADASJP1/0601ENCHILADASJP1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "American cheese, Cheddar, tortilla, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 479}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 658, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "630 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup neutral oil, like canola, or use lard or chicken or beef fat", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/2\u00a0teaspoon dried oregano, ideally Mexican oregano", "2 tablespoons chile powder", "2 cups chicken broth, ideally homemade or low-sodium if store-bought", "1/2 cup neutral oil, like canola", "12 yellow corn tortillas", "3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, or a mixture of 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese and 1 1/2\u00a0cups American cheese, like Velveeta", "1 medium-size white onion, peeled and chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chili gravy: In a medium saut\u00e9 pan set over medium-high heat, heat oil or fat until it begins to shimmer.
