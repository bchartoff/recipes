{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lucas Schoormans\u2019s Lemon Tart", "description": "Lucas Schoorman, a Chelsea art dealer and hobbyist baker, introduced this elegant lemon tart to the Times in 2004. It's a showstopper dessert featuring two distinct, delicious layers: one of frangipani, an almond-rich custard, and another of shimmering lemon confit scattered with slices of lemon. It is mellow and barely sweet, rich and deep, with none of the attack of so many lemon desserts.\n\nBegin steeping the lemon slices the night before you're planning on baking the tart. This softens the rinds and coaxes out their bitterness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Reynolds"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/31/dining/Lemon-Tart/Lemon-Tart-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "almonds, frangipani, lemon, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 102}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 lemons, thinly sliced, ends and seeds discarded", "1 cup sugar", "1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped", "2 cups all-purpose flour", "9 tablespoons sugar", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "6 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter", "3 large egg yolks", "11 tablespoons softened, unsalted butter", "2/3 cup ground almonds", "2 tablespoons flour", "1/2 cup sugar", "Grated zest from 1 lemon", "2 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the confit: place sliced lemons in a bowl and cover with boiling water.
