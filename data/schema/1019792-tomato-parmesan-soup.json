{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tomato-Parmesan Soup", "description": "What if you could have a tomato soup that was as plush as a cream of tomato but tasted like pure tomato? Enter Parmesan. Simmering tomatoes with a Parmesan rind is like seasoning a bowl of soup with a shaving of cheese 100 times over. It gives the soup an undercurrent of savory fat and salt that only bring out tomato's best sides. Many specialty groceries sell containers of rinds, but if you can\u2019t find any, stir \u00bd cup grated Parmesan into the final soup (or cut off the rind of a wedge you\u2019re working through). Rinds will keep in the freezer for forever, so start saving. Pair the soup with Parmesan toast, for dunking, though it\u2019s in no way needed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/27/dining/as-tomato-parmesan-soup/as-tomato-parmesan-soup-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "fall, winter, main course, parmesan, tomatoes, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 431}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1252, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "177 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "15 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "2950 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 yellow onion, chopped", "5 garlic cloves, sliced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Salt and black pepper", "2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes", "6 ounces Parmesan rind", "4 (about 3/4-inch thick) slices of baguette", "1 garlic clove, peeled", "1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the butter.
