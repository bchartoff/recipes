{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beet And Ginger Soup", "description": "This beet and ginger soup is a snap to make. Many people believe that beets cleanse the liver and that ginger wards off colds, but even if you give no credence to such beliefs, it doesn't matter: this soup is just plain good to eat.\n\nI like to make things easy for myself and do no more than blend drained canned beets with additive- and sodium-free broth and grated fresh ginger. The soup can be wonderful at room temperature, or, if you like your soup piping hot, you can heat everything in a pan. But I never do. I just blend and drink. This must be the quickest route to a restoring bowl or mug of something on record.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/15/dining/Beet-And-Ginger-Soup/Beet-And-Ginger-Soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, beet, ginger, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 81, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1115 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces cooked beets (or one 15-ounce can, drained)", "2 teaspoons minced or grated ginger", "1 cup hot vegetable broth", "4 teaspoons lemon juice", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chop cooked beets roughly, and put into a blender with ginger, hot broth and lemon juice.
