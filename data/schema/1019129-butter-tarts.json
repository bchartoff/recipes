{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butter Tarts", "description": "There may be no more perfectly satisfying treat than a Canadian butter tart. It is small and sweet, bracingly so, with hints of butterscotch and caramel. And each bite delivers three textures: flaky crust, chewy top, gooey center. While its exact origins may never be found, the tart became popular in Ontario in the early 20th century and spread across Canada thanks to its inclusion in the 1913 \u201cFive Roses Cook Book.\u201d Today there are numerous variations. Runny or firm? Raisins or plain? This recipe can be adapted to please all partisans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/17/dining/17TartsRex1/merlin_132007970_0525c909-b987-44b4-ab61-4fec3f5925ec-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "1 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "canadian", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, pies and tarts", "keywords": "brown sugar, raisins, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 824}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 177, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "100 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cup/191 grams all-purpose flour, more for dusting", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/113 grams cold unsalted butter or lard (103 grams), cubed", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters ice water", "1 large egg yolk", "1 teaspoon white vinegar", "1/4 cup/36 grams raisins (optional)", "1 cup/220 grams packed brown sugar, light or dark (see Note)", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 cup/57 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 large egg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pastry: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt.
