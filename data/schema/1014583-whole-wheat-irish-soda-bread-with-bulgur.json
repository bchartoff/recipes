It is a very quick and easy bread to make as long as you are willing to get your hands sticky. When you pull the bread from the oven wrap it loosely in a kitchen towel and allow to cool. This softens the crust and makes it easier to cut.<br/><br/>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/05/science/07recipehealth/07recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 9-inch loaf (about 16 generous slices)", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, buttermilk, medium bulgur wheat, whole wheat flour, halal, healthy, kosher, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "recipeIngredient": ["120 grams (about 3/4 cup) medium (#2) bulgur", "1 cup boiling water", "460 grams (about 3 2/3 cups) whole wheat flour", "8 grams baking soda (1 1/2 teaspoons)", "10 grams salt (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)", "2 cups buttermilk (more as needed)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the bulgur in a bowl and pour on 1 cup boiling water, or enough to cover the bulgur by about 1/2 inch.
