It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nThis simple fried egg quesadilla makes as fine a light supper as it does a breakfast repast. Easy work: Melt some butter in a pan and gently cook a corn tortilla in it. Top the tortilla with grated Cheddar, a slice of deli ham or some cooked bacon if you want them, a little chopped cilantro or salsa or hot sauce, and another tortilla. Cook, flipping the quesadilla a few times, until it is crisp and golden and the cheese has melted into lace at the sides. Use a spatula to pull it out of the pan, and place it onto a cutting board to rest. Fry an egg in the now-empty pan with a little more butter, then cut the quesadilla into quarters, placing the egg on top. Top with cilantro and hot sauce or salsa.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17norecipe-friedegg/17norecipe-friedegg-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, tacos", "keywords": "cheddar, corn tortillas, egg, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 422}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
