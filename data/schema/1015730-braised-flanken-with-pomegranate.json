{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Flanken With Pomegranate", "description": "I\u2019d always thought that flanken was specific to boiled beef or soup. But a little research divulged that the brawny cut is hugely popular in braises (and pot-roasting is arguably the same as braising), especially in Germany, Austria and Hungary. It also shines in Asian cuisines, particularly Korean, in which it\u2019s seared and served rare.\n\nArthur Schwartz, in his book \u201cJewish Home Cooking\u201d (Ten Speed Press, 2008), extols the virtues of flanken. He points out that it\u2019s from the same part of the animal as short ribs, cut across rather than along the bones. But while short ribs have achieved culinary stardom and high prices, flanken remains cheap and obscure. And just as tasty.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/flanken-still/flanken-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "flanken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 982, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "77 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "50 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "601 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds flanken ribs", "1/2 teaspoon salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more to taste", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3 medium carrots, peeled and diced", "3 medium celery stalks, diced", "2 leeks, white and light green parts, cleaned, quartered lengthwise and chopped", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 shallot, chopped", "1/2 cup pomegranate juice", "1/3 cup dry red wine", "2 cups chicken stock, or as needed", "3 thyme branches (see note)", "1 rosemary branch", "1 bay leaf", "3 whole cloves", "1 1/2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses (optional)", "1/3 cup pomegranate seeds", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
