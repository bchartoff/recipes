{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Chicken Thighs With Peaches, Basil and Ginger", "description": "A ripe, succulent peach is one of nature\u2019s greatest gifts. But a hard peach? It, too, is a gift, especially in this simple recipe from Melissa Clark. A roast in a 400-degree oven cooks the peaches alongside boneless, skinless chicken thighs, drawing out their flavor and softening them as they meld with those flavorful drippings. Speaking of those pan juices, don\u2019t cast them aside: Sop them up instead with crusty bread. You won\u2019t regret it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/18/dining/Chicken-with-Peach-Basil-Ginger/merlin_158022834_0e344164-0010-4ba7-b942-f072456ab5d3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, one pot", "keywords": "chicken, peach, gluten-free, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 766}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 315, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "459 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound hard peaches (about 1 large or 2 to 3 small ones, see note)", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch strips", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons dry (fino) sherry, or use white wine or dry vermouth", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger root, grated", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Crusty bread or rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
