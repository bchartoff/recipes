{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tacos al Pastor", "description": "Tacos al pastor, a Mexican street-food staple, are a perfect synthesis of local flavors (pineapple, chiles, annatto), Spanish influence (pork, adobo), and Middle Eastern technique (a spinning, shawarma-style vertical rotisserie). The synthesis comes from Mexico\u2019s history, but perfection comes from the combination of sweet pineapple, spicy meat and fragrant corn. This recipe, from the chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara, provides an easy way to make it at home; try boneless chicken thighs if you don\u2019t want pork. Either way, make sure to blot the meat until very dry before cooking it so you get a hard sear that mimics the char of a grill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/05/dining/04Camararex2/merlin_155267136_8a0323b8-1d07-4f62-ae0b-f6dbc82d33c6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 tacos (3 to 4 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, meat, tacos", "keywords": "chiles de \u00e1rbol, corn tortillas, pineapple, pork tenderloin, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 dried cascabel chiles", "1 dried ancho or guajillo chile", "2 plum tomatoes, halved and cored", "1/4 small white onion", "1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed orange juice", "2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice", "1 to 2 chiles de \u00e1rbol (depending on how much heat you like), stems removed", "3 garlic cloves", "1 whole clove or 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon ground achiote (annatto) seeds", "Pinch of ground cumin", "Pinch of dried oregano", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "2 pounds pork tenderloin, thinly sliced crosswise then cut into bite-size slices and shreds", "Kosher salt", "1 cup small chunks fresh pineapple", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "12 corn tortillas", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more as needed", "Minced white onion and chopped fresh cilantro, in separate bowls, for topping", "Hot sauce and lime wedges, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the marinade: Break off the stem ends of the cascabel and ancho (or guajillo) chiles and shake out and discard the seeds.
