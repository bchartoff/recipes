Cook in water to cover, with garlic, until tender, about 10 minutes. Mash potatoes, still unpeeled, in a food mill or with a mashing tool; pick out and discard large pieces of skin. Stir in the basil and buttermilk; season with salt and pepper, and serve. (Potatoes can be made in advance and refrigerated. Before serving, put potatoes in glass dish, cover with plastic wrap and reheat in microwave oven for 4 to 6 minutes on high setting. Stir once or twice while reheating. If potatoes become too dry, stir in a little buttermilk.)"}]}
