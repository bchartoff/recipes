If you\u2019d prefer a little more fiber, you can substitute a third of the all-purpose flour with whole-wheat or rye flour. The banana bourbon syrup, studded with pecans, makes these waffles sweet enough for dessert. If you do go that route, a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream would not be amiss. Or serve the waffles with some butter, sliced bananas and a drizzle of plain maple syrup for a simple but satisfying breakfast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/27/multimedia/clark-waffles/clark-waffles-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "About 10 waffles", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "dessert, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 143}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 325, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "323 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["7 tablespoons unsalted butter, more for waffle iron", "1 large ripe banana, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds", "2 tablespoons bourbon", "1/2 cup maple syrup", "50 grams toasted chopped pecans (1/2 cup), optional", "160 grams all-purpose flour (1 1/4 cups)", "100 grams finely ground cornmeal (3/4 cup)", "15 grams sugar (1 tablespoon)", "8 grams baking powder (1 teaspoon)", "5 grams fine sea salt (1 teaspoon)", "3 grams baking soda (1/2 teaspoon)", "1 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt", "1 cup whole milk", "4 large eggs, separated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 5 tablespoons butter either on the stove or in the microwave.
