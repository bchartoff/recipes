{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Miso-Glazed Tofu With Wild Mushrooms", "description": "Asian flavors suit mushrooms as well as the Mediterranean seasonings I usually work with. This Japanese-inspired miso glaze is used with both the tofu, as a glaze, and as a flavoring for the mushrooms.  I used a mixed mushroom pack from Whole Foods for this, which included varieties of enokis and maitakes, with both thin and thick stems that had a nice meaty texture but weren\u2019t tough like shiitake stems. If salt is a concern, look for a lower-sodium miso, now available from a few companies.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/02/science/05recipehealth/05recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 190}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "646 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup mirin", "1/4 cup sake, vegetable or mushroom stock, or chicken stock", "2 rounded tablespoons white or yellow miso paste", "1 teaspoon sugar", "2 teaspoons dark sesame oil, divided", "1 pound mixed wild mushrooms \u2013 recommend enoki type mushrooms and maitakes", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or grape seed oil, divided", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Salt to taste", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "Pinch of cayenne (more to taste)", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1 14-ounce block firm tofu"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the miso glaze, combine mirin and sake or stock in the smallest saucepan you have and bring to a boil over high heat.
