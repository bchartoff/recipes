{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Poached Chicken Breasts With Tomatillos and Jalape\u00f1os", "description": "Boneless, skinless chicken breasts can be easy to overcook, going from tender to rubbery in a matter of seconds. Not so here, where the breasts are cooked in chicken stock in a very low oven, which keeps them moist and juicy.\u00a0Tomatillos, jalape\u00f1os and garlic, which are roasted at the same time, turn golden and soft before being chopped into a vibrant, cilantro-laced salsa. Make this on days when you don\u2019t mind having the oven on low for a couple of hours. It may take a while to cook, but most of that time is entirely hands-off.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/16/dining/16apperex1/merlin_148504038_e388f782-55d2-4dfb-bd56-a30df1cd9ea6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken breast, jalape\u00f1o, tomatillo, low-carb, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 232}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 573, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "765 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 quart chicken stock, plus more as needed (or use salted water)", "1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (3 medium breasts)", "1 1/2 pounds tomatillos, cut into 1/2-inch chunks", "2 to 3 jalape\u00f1os, thinly sliced", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "3/4 cup cilantro leaves, roughly chopped", "3 scallions, thinly sliced", "Finely grated zest of 1/2 lime", "1 avocado, sliced", "Fresh lime juice, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place racks in the top and bottom third of the oven and heat to 275 degrees.
