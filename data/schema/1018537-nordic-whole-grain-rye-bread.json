{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nordic Whole-Grain Rye Bread", "description": "Scandinavian rye breads look nothing like the slices that clamp together the sandwiches at your neighborhood deli in New York. Made from whole grains and naturally risen, they are chewy, fragrant and deliciously dark. With butter and cheese, or as the base for avocado toast, they are amazingly satisfying. The taste and texture are addictive, and many enthusiasts also appreciate that rye bread contains more fiber and less gluten than wheat. This recipe, with a small amount of yeast, is quicker than the truly ancient version, which takes at least three days. Don't worry if the dough seems runny and sticky: That is typical of rye bread, which needs lots of water to soften the grain.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/11/dining/11RYE-slide-9T8W/11RYE-slide-9T8W-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "2 large or 3 medium loaves", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "Nordic, rye", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 205}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/85 grams buttermilk, skyr or yogurt, at room temperature", "2 cups/250 grams medium rye flour", "\u00bd teaspoon/2 grams active dry yeast", "2 cups/340 grams cracked rye berries or coarse rye meal", "1 cup/170 grams sunflower seeds", "4 cups/400 grams medium rye flour", "4 teaspoons/20 grams kosher or coarse sea salt", "3 tablespoons/40 grams malt syrup or molasses (not blackstrap)", "\u00bd teaspoon/2 grams active dry yeast"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On Day 1, make the starter: In a medium-size bowl, mix 3/4 cup warm water with the buttermilk or yogurt.

Mix dough firmly by hand to combine. The dough should be grainy, but quite runny and wet, almost like a thick batter. To achieve that texture, add cold water, 1/4 cup at a time, mixing after each addition.
