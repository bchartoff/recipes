Add the butter, sugar, corn syrup and raspberries, and stir until well blended. Place the pan over medium heat and slowly bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often. Let the mixture continue to boil slowly for eight minutes without stirring. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the sauce into a container. Let it cool for 15 minutes if serving it hot, or cover and refrigerate until needed. It will last for at least a month. The sauce may be reheated slowly."}]}
