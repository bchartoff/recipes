{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fris\u00e9e aux Lardons", "description": "Here is a bistro salad classic of curly endive with bacon and poached egg that demands a kind of ruthlessness from its cooks. You want curly endive with tender, blanched centers. That means the darker green outer leaves must be removed and not used in the dish. You want to expose the pale inner leaves and keep them looking as natural as possible. Don\u2019t chop them. For the lardons, use bacon or, if you don\u2019t want its smoky taste, unsmoked pancetta. And when you fry them, take care to brown the lardons lightly so that they are crisp, but with a little give. Don\u2019t overcook them, or the egg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/11/dining/11frisee/11frisee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "quick, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "bacon, eggs, endive", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 390, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "493 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 handfuls tender, pale curly endive (about 10 ounces)", "6 ounces thick-cut bacon, sliced crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick lardons", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated garlic", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and pepper", "4 eggs", "12 thin slices from a French baguette, lightly toasted and rubbed with a garlic clove"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash and dry curly endive, place in a shallow salad bowl and refrigerate."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small skillet, simmer bacon for about 5 minutes in a small amount of water.
