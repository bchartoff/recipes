This doesn\u2019t mean you should use that incredible bottle of Champagne you were given as a birthday present, but it does mean you should use a good, dry sparkling wine that tastes delicious without the addition of fruit juice. Cava, which may bring to mind Champagne more than prosecco does, is also substantially lower in price. As to the juice, squeeze it fresh \u2014 from whatever sorts of orange citrus you like best \u2014 and strain it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/13/dining/rs-mimosa/rs-mimosa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "Champagne, orange juice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 118, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "6 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces freshly squeezed orange juice, strained (blood oranges, clementines or whatever you have on hand also work)", "4 ounces Champagne or cava", "Mint sprigs, for garnish (optional)", "Orange liqueur, such as Cointreau or Grand Marnier (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour juice into a Champagne flute, top with sparkling wine.
