{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Seared Hake and Asparagus With Aioli", "description": "In this light, flavorful weeknight meal, mild hake fillets are pan-fried in butter with plenty of sweet scallions, and served with crisp green asparagus cooked in the same pan. Then, everything is drizzled with a thin, garlicky aioli, which acts as a pungent sauce. If you can get green garlic (often in season at the same time as asparagus), use it in the aioli. It gives a more rounded, gentle flavor,\u00a0but regular garlic works nicely, too, packing more of a punch. If you can\u2019t get hake, this dish will work with cod, flounder, black fish and the like. Just be sure to adjust the cooking time, adding or subtracting a minute or two if the fillets are thicker or thinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/06/dining/06appetite1/06appetite1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "asparagus, hake, healthy, low-carb, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 177}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 671, "unsaturatedFatContent": "39 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "56 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "545 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 to 2 garlic cloves, finely grated or mashed to a paste, or use 1 tablespoon minced green garlic", "1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste", "1 large egg", "1 large egg yolk", "3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon or chives", "4 (6-ounce) hake fillets, patted dry", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 1/2 pounds asparagus, woody ends trimmed, cut into 1 1/4-inch pieces", "2 red or regular scallions, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the aioli: Combine garlic, lemon juice and salt in a blender or food processor, and let sit a minute or two.
