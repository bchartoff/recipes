{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Endive Leaves With Crab Rillettes", "description": "Canned lump crabmeat is transformed in these light, slightly spicy rillettes. I have been pleased with the canned lump crabmeat I have been finding lately at Trader Joe\u2019s. It is fresh and perfect for both crab cakes and for these light, slightly spicy rillettes, which I serve on endive leaves. You can also stuff cherry tomatoes with the rillettes, or mini bell peppers, or just serve them on croutons or crackers. You have a choice here of using a combination of Greek yogurt and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or all Greek yogurt. In the spirit of rillettes, which would be much fattier than these if they were more authentic, I vote for the yogurt/cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche combo, but if you want to keep calories down use all yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/06/science/10recipehealth/10recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, dips and spreads", "keywords": "gluten-free, halal, high protein, low-carb, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 70, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "166 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces lump crabmeat", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt", "2 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (or omit and use 4 tablespoons yogurt)", "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (to taste)", "1 to 2 tablespoons minced chives (to taste)", "1 to 2 tablespoons finely chopped mint (to taste)", "1 serrano pepper, finely chopped", "Salt to taste", "4 endives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain crabmeat and place in a medium bowl.
