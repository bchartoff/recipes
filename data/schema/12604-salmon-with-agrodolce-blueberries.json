I could also see spooning it over boneless chicken thighs before roasting, or pairing it with meaty pork tenderloin or chops that have just come off the grill in all their smoky glory.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/18/dining/18APPE_SPAN/18APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "blueberries, salmon, white wine, gluten-free, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 234}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 817, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "71 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "826 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 (8-ounce) fillets wild king salmon", "Sea salt, as needed", "Vegetable oil for baking sheet", "2 shallots, peeled and very thinly sliced", "1 and a half cups white wine", "2 tablespoons white wine vinegar", "4 springs fresh thyme", "2 cinnamon sticks, broken in half", "1 and a third cups blueberries", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons honey", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Run your fingers over the salmon flesh and pull out any pinbones.
