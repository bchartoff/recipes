{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "\u2018Twin Peaks\u2019 Cherry Pie", "description": "This is a composite sketch of the perfect cherry pie. The buttery, well-seasoned crust is adapted from the Cherry Pie That\u2019ll Kill Ya at Butter and Scotch, a bar and bakery in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, that holds an occasional Twin Peaks Tuesday, with cocktails and diner foods named after the characters in David Lynch\u2019s quirky 1990s television show. It uses a mock buttermilk crust, meaning that you curdle regular whole milk with apple cider vinegar instead of having to buy buttermilk. Instructions are given for a lattice top, but you could make it with a double crust or the chevron shown here, depending on your mood. The filling is all about maximizing the flavor of pure sour cherries (sometimes labeled pie cherries). This is the pie to make at the height of sour-cherry season, or using a bounty you freeze yourself (see the tip below). Frozen sour cherries are also available online. The pie will keep for up to five days, refrigerated and wrapped in plastic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/17/dining/17PIE3/17PEAK3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "1 pie", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "cherry liqueur, sour cherry, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 289}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 390, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "425 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/120 milliliters cold whole milk, plus more if needed", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar", "2 2/3 cups/340 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "8 ounces/227 grams (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/2-inch (12 millimeter) cubes", "1 large egg", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whole milk", "Raw sugar, for sprinkling", "8 cups/38 ounces/1,100 grams pitted sour cherries, fresh or frozen", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar (see tip)", "5 tablespoons/36 grams cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 tablespoons cherry liqueur or cherry-flavored brandy"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In a liquid measuring cup, stir together the milk and vinegar.
