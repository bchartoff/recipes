If they weigh a lot more than 4 ounces apiece (they usually weigh about twice that) cut them in half. Place two sheets of plastic wrap on your cutting board or counter, overlapping slightly, to make a single large sheet, and brush lightly with oil. Place a chicken breast in the middle and place two more sheets of plastic on top. Working from the center to the outside, pound the meat with the flat side of a meat tenderizer until very flat, 1/4 inch thick or (preferably) even thinner. Make sure you come down flat with the meat tenderizer, and don\u2019t pound too hard; if you hit the meat with the edge, you will tear it."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the pounded chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
