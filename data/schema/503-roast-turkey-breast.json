{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Turkey Breast", "description": "Roasting a whole turkey breast for Thanksgiving, rather than an entire bird, offers a few clear advantages. It cuts roasting time at least in half, reduces the hassle of carving, and frees you to create more interesting side dishes. But perhaps the best argument for roasting a breast is that you can produce white meat that is truly moist, as opposed to the dried-out white meat that results from roasting a whole turkey until the legs are cooked through. A breast of about three pounds is fine for a party of four, while one weighing six pounds or more can serve about 10. And yes, there are usually enough leftovers for sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/27/dining/27COOKING-TURKEYBREAST1/27COOKING-TURKEYBREAST1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "main course, turkey breast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 491}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 392, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "50 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "603 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3- to 6-pound turkey breast", "2 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
