I tasted it and it reminded me of a dessert my mother used to make.\" At a dinner he served it cooked in chicken stock with shallots, tomato essence, red wine vinegar, chives and salt and pepper. It produced just the reaction from the diners that Mr. Richard seeks. \"I want people to say, WOW!,\" he said. \"I want to create a surprise that you don't expect: something elegant, something sharp, something silky, something crunchy.\"", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Marian Burros"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, french", "recipeCategory": "quick, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "cream of wheat, shallot, tomato, dairy-free, side dish", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 115, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "464 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 medium tomatoes", "1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "1/2 cup Cream of Wheat", "1 tablespoon finely diced shallots", "1 tablespoon finely diced chives", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil", "1 tablespoon chopped chervil or Italian parsley", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium pot of water to boil.
