{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dried Fruit Compote With Fresh Apple and Pear", "description": "This compote, which I like to add to my morning yogurt, does not involve wine, though you could add some red or white wine for flavor if you wanted to. The sweetness will vary with the type of fruit used. If you use dried sour cherries, don\u2019t use too many, because they will give the compote too strong a sour cherry flavor. Sweet fruit, like dried apples, pears and raisins, will result in a compote with a brighter taste. Apricots are great too, contributing another rich taste layer. I add fresh apple and pear for their texture, which remains somewhat crunchy even after they simmer.\n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/01/science/03recipehealth/03recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 27, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups water", "3 tablespoons mild honey, such as clover (more to taste)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cinnamon stick", "2 strips orange zest", "1 strip lemon zest", "1 firm but ripe pear, peeled, cored and diced (optional)", "1 apple, preferably a slightly tart variety like Pink Lady, peeled, cored and diced (optional) ", "Whipped cream or plain yogurt for serving, if desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut large pieces of dried fruit into smaller pieces."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
