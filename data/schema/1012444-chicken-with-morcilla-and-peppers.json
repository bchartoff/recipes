{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken With Morcilla and Peppers", "description": "As I tasted the reds from Bierzo, I wanted food that was dark, rich and earthy. Why not morcilla \u2014 Spanish blood sausage? A plate of nicely seared morcilla, or French boudin noir, would be enough alongside these wines.But in this dish of chicken on a bed of cannellini beans, the morcilla provides just an accent, albeit forceful, like a spoonful of horseradish on boiled beef. Another kind of sausage \u2014 or none at all \u2014 could be used, though it would change the dish\u2019s character and color.I cooked the beans separately to guarantee their tenderness. Canned beans provide an acceptable shortcut. For six servings, I used chicken breasts, thighs and wings, briefly seared. With one chicken cut up, double the amount of sausage.
