{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crab With Crisp Bitter Greens", "description": "This outstanding dinner salad came to The Times via the British chef and restaurateur April Bloomfield, whose John Dory Oyster Bar in New York sometimes serves a slightly spicy crab salad with arugula and the tender fall chicory known as puntarelle. I swapped out those greens for a mix of endive and chicory, and the Holland chili pepper she uses at the restaurant for a more accessible jalape\u00f1o pepper. The result accentuates the sweetness of the crab, and features a fiery slickness beneath it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/14/magazine/14eat3/14eat3-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "belgian endive, chicory, crab meat, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 19}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 475, "unsaturatedFatContent": "38 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "46 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "435 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 Belgian endive", "1 head chicory", "3 cups arugula (roughly 3 handfuls)", "1 egg yolk", "1/4 teaspoon minced garlic", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed\nlemon juice", "1 cup plus 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1 pound crabmeat (approximately 2 cups)", "1 small jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded and finely\ndiced (approximately 2 teaspoons)", "1 pinch Maldon or other flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Separate the endive leaves, then\nslice them lengthwise as thinly as you\ncan.
