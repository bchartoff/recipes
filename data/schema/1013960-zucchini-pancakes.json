{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Zucchini Pancakes", "description": "<i>Mucver</i> (pronounced <i>moosh</i>-vair) are delicate, crisp zucchini pancakes popular in Turkey. This version has not just shredded zucchini, but also tiny clouds of feta and a sprinkling of minced fresh dill and scallions. They are crisp on the outside, tender within and subtly herbaceous. The trick to making the pancakes crisp and not soggy is to squeeze all the water out of the zucchini before mixing it with the other ingredients. A little brute force is required.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Elaine Louie"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/07/dining/el-zucchini-pancakes/merlin_158856510_3c13b817-982c-41a4-999d-21036ee49f57-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "12 pancakes", "recipeCuisine": "turkish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, weeknight, pancakes", "keywords": "appetizer, dill, feta, zucchini, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1617}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 151, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "244 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 medium zucchini (about 1 pound), shredded", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "3 large eggs, beaten", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 cup crumbled feta cheese", "3 scallions, finely chopped", "1/3 cup finely chopped dill", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "4 to 6 tablespoons vegetable oil, more as needed", "2/3 cup plain yogurt", "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
