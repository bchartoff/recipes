Red curry paste, coconut milk and peanut butter spice the chicken, rice and vegetables in this hands-off, one-pot recipe. Chunky peanut butter adds nuttiness, crunch and creaminess all at once. Feel free to swap out the carrots and broccoli for vegetables with similar cooking times, like sweet potato or snap peas. Drizzle your red curry rice with lime-spiked coconut milk for brightness just before digging in.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/05/dining/as-red-curry-rice-with-chicken/merlin_166828575_c483dcfe-caae-4a5e-b19a-3cb8f5051c76-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice, poultry, vegetables", "keywords": "broccoli, carrot, chicken, fish sauce, jasmine rice, lime, peanut butter, red curry paste, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1218}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (13-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "1/4 cup red curry paste", "3 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter", "2 tablespoons fish sauce", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 3/4-inch pieces", "2 large carrots, peeled and thinly sliced (about 1 cup)", "1 1/2 cups jasmine rice, rinsed", "1 1/4 cups boiling water", "1 head broccoli, thick stems discarded, florets separated (about 2 cups florets)", "1 tablespoon lime juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
