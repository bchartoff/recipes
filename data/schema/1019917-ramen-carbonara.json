{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ramen Carbonara", "description": "If you have bacon, eggs and a pack of ramen noodles in the pantry, this quick dinner (or breakfast or lunch) comes together in a snap. The strategy: Cook the noodles in a Parmesan-rich broth in the same pan you use to cook the bacon. The clever cook who invented this is the novelist Stacey Ballis, a regular contributor to the breakfast blog Extra Crispy. Since ramen noodles are parcooked, they quickly soften and soak up the broth. (Stirring in eggs thickens it into a sauce.) If you use pancetta and good Parmesan, it tastes surprisingly like the Roman original. But it is always delicious and filling, and even more unctuous if you add a runny fried egg on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/dining/23pantryrex/23pantryrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, noodles", "keywords": "bacon, parmesan, ramen, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1040}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1300, "unsaturatedFatContent": "46 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "95 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "43 grams", "sodiumContent": "3164 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 to 8 slices bacon or pancetta, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch strips or lardons (4 to 6 ounces)", "2 cups boiling water", "3 tablespoons\u00a0butter, plus more for frying eggs", "1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino, or a combination (about 4 ounces)", "2 (3-ounce) packages\u00a0ramen noodles (noodle blocks only; discard the seasoning packs)", "2 eggs, whisked together until smooth", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 whole eggs, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet (preferably nonstick), cook bacon over medium heat until fat is rendered and meat is cooked through.
