{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Polenta and Broccoli Rabe Lasagna", "description": "This lasagna layers noodles, polenta, mozzarella, sauce and broccoli rabe for a wonderfully savory and multi-textured one-dish meal. A note about the lasagna noodles: You don\u2019t have to boil them, nor do you have to buy special no-boil noodles. You can soak the noodles in a bowl of water while you prepare the other ingredients, then slap them in the casserole dish. They will start to soften in their cold bath and finish cooking as the lasagna bakes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/28/dining/28APPE_SPAN/28APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "broccoli rabe, lasagna noodles, polenta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 51}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 592, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "703 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["18 dry lasagna noodles (from 1 package)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1/8 teaspoon red chile flakes, plus more for serving (optional)", "1 28-ounce can or box chopped tomatoes", "2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil", "1 large bunch broccoli rabe (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "1 1/4 cups quick-cooking polenta", "18-ounce container mascarpone or fresh ricotta", "4 ounces parmesan, finely grated (about 1 cup)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "12 ounces fresh mozzarella, torn into bite-size pieces", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the lasagna noodles in a large bowl of cold water to soak (if you are using no-boil noodles, you can skip this step).
