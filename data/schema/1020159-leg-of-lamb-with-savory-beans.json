But it is always appropriate for any special dinner party, or any occasion throughout the year when you want an impressive main course. The technique is simple and requires few ingredients (garlic, thyme and rosemary), but the result is very flavorful. Seasoning the lamb for at least an hour in advance of roasting is essential. Refrigerate it overnight for more intense flavor; it\u2019s also less work to do on the day of the feast. Just remove from the refrigerator, bring it to room temperature, and it\u2019s ready for the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/17/dining/12kitchenrex/12kitchenrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "carrot, leg of lamb, white beans, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 109}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound flageolet or white beans, such as cannellini (about 2 cups)", "2 whole cloves", "1 medium onion, halved", "2 bay leaves", "1 large carrot, cut into 2-inch chunks", "1 whole head garlic, cut in half horizontally", "1 small fistful of thyme sprigs", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1 tablespoon finely cut chives", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest (from 1 lemon)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Black pepper, to taste", "1 (8- to 9-pound) leg of lamb, bone-in, trimmed and tied (a butcher can do this)", "6 medium garlic cloves, cut into quarters lengthwise", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 medium onions, halved crosswise", "2 celery stalks, cut into 3-inch-long pieces", "2 thyme bunches", "2 rosemary bunches", "2 cups dry white wine", "1 1/2 pounds small, young carrots", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Watercress, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the beans in Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot.
