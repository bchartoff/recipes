{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro Broccoli Bowl With Lemony Tahini\u00a0", "description": "A hearty vegetarian dinner-in-a-bowl, farro is dressed in a lemony tahini sauce spiked with garlic, and topped with charred broccoli florets, thin slices of turnip or radish, and a soft-yolked egg. To streamline the cooking process here, the eggs are simmered in the same pot as the farro. But if you want to substitute leftover grains for the farro (brown or white rice, for example), cook the egg separately using the same timing. Or leave off the egg altogether for a vegan variation. The flavors here are mellow enough for kids, but a squirt of chile sauce or a sliced green chile garnish adds a smack of grown-up heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/dining/09apperex1/09apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, grains and rice", "keywords": "broccoli, eggs, farro, sesame seeds, tahini, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 773}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 704, "unsaturatedFatContent": "36 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "46 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "736 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups farro, rinsed and drained", "4 large eggs, scrubbed under hot running water", "1 large head broccoli, cut into florets,\u00a0tender stems sliced (about 1 1/4 pounds)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon soy sauce, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "1 tablespoon sesame seeds", "Thinly sliced Hakurei turnips or radishes, for serving (optional)", "1 scallion, thinly sliced", "Hot sauce or thinly sliced green chiles, for serving (optional)", "2 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more for serving", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "3 tablespoons tahini"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.
