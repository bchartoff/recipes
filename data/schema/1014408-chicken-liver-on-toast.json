Get it done in eight hours. Lobster and chopped salad, soubise and root vegetables, and a roasted chicken were all on the menu. And so was this recipe for chicken liver on toast. It may not have been the star of the show that night, but it served a critical purpose: keeping appetites satisfied in the lead-up to the meal. It can be an appetizer, or, paired with a salad, an exemplary light lunch or dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman And Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/dining/ChickenLiver/ChickenLiver-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken liver, chipotle chilies, dry red wine, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 46}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "276 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 medium-size red onion, peeled and finely chopped", "1 pound chicken livers, cleaned and trimmed", "1 dried chipotle, softened in hot water and finely chopped", "1 cup dry red wine", "Salt and black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter over medium heat in a large saut\u00e9 pan.
