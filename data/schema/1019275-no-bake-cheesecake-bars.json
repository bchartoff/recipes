Unlike a traditional cheesecake, the no-bake variety is eggless, making it smooth, light, and all about the dairy. This version includes tangy Greek yogurt and a bit of whipped cream for added loft. Serve big squares with in-season fresh fruit or a dollop of fresh jam.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/09/dining/09COOKING-NOBAKECHZCAKE1/09COOKING-NOBAKECHZCAKE1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "24 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "cream cheese, graham cracker, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 387}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 267, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "179 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["18 whole graham crackers (about 9 1/2 ounces/269 grams)", "8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 pounds/678 grams full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature", "1 1/2 cup/185 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract", "2 cups (1-17.6 ounce/500 grams container) full-fat Greek yogurt, at room temperature", "1 1/4 cup cold heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a 13-inch-by-9-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides.
