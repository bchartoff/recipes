It is neither a Thanksgiving meal nor a Christmas one, but simply a low-fi American reminder of diners and TV dinners and blankets and comfort itself: soft meat and rich, salty gravy over tight-crumbed bread, with buttery mash and a tang of cranberry. My recipe calls for roasting buttered turkey thighs in the oven while the potatoes were cooking, skin-side down to crisp the skin and allow the fat to render into the pan, creating sticky bits of fond you\u2019ll use to build a base for gravy. Pile the sliced meat onto lightly toasted bread, drench it with gravy and serve alongside the potatoes and peas. Adding canned cranberry sauce, in this application, is no sin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/16/magazine/16mag-eat-image1/16mag-eat-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches", "keywords": "bread, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, peas, sage, stock, turkey, white wine, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 73}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 turkey thighs", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage", "1 tablespoon lemon zest", "1 cup dry white wine", "2 to 3 cups turkey or chicken stock", "4 tablespoons instant flour, or all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons cream, milk or half-and-half", "2 slices bread of your choosing, traditionally white sandwich bread", "Buttered peas, mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove turkey and butter from the refrigerator an hour or so before cooking, so that they are approaching room temperature when the turkey goes into the oven."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400.
