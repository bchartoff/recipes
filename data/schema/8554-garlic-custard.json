Place the ramekins in a baking dish; pour boiling water in the dish until it comes halfway up the side. Carefully ladle the custard into the ramekins, filling each to 1/4 inch from the top. Bake until the custard is just set, about 40 minutes. The custard may be served warm from the ramekins or chilled and unmolded onto serving plates. (To unmold, run a knife around the edge of each ramekin, place a plate upside down over the top and quickly flip so that the plate is right side up. Tap or gently shake the ramekin to release the custard.)"}]}
