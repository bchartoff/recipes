Don\u2019t think about it. Don\u2019t consider the lobster, as David Foster Wallace once did. Don\u2019t take a position, ethically speaking. Just act. It will be easier for all involved. And once you do it, the rewards are deep: the sweet, tender meat, for dipping in melted butter and piling onto your plate with potatoes and corn, and the shells, to saut\u00e9 and simmer into a luxurious stock.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/26/dining/26COOKING-LOBSTER2/26COOKING-LOBSTER2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "lobster, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 78}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 804, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "129 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "3301 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon sea salt", "5 live lobsters (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds each)", "1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted", "Steamed corn (optional)", "Baked potatoes (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large lobster pot with 1 inch of water. Stir in the salt, set a rack or large steamer basket in the bottom and bring the water to a boil. Add the lobsters, cover with a tight-fitting lid and return the water to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to a gentle boil and steam the lobsters until they are bright red, about 10 minutes. Check doneness by pulling an antenna. If it comes off without resistance, the lobster is done. If not, cook for a few more minutes. Serve with melted butter and, if you choose, corn and potatoes. Remove the meat from the fifth lobster and refrigerate for use later in lobster risotto (recipe <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1016088/lobster-risotto.html\">here</a>). After eating, reserve the lobster shells for stock (recipe here). Serves 4."}]}
