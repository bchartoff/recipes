{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro With Salmon, Cucumber, Radicchio and Dill", "description": "Salmon steams right over toasty farro, saving you from having to wash an extra pan. The silky fish and chewy grains get a refreshing lemony salad of cucumbers and radicchio on top, which is prepared while the farro cooks. Each bite goes from crunchy cool to warm and comforting, though the salad is also good room temperature or cold. If you don't like the bitter edge of radicchio, try thinly sliced endive or fennel instead. For a salty, creamy hit of flavor, sprinkle the top of the salad with crumbled feta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/17/dining/farro-salmon/farro-salmon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, grains and rice, seafood", "keywords": "cucumber, dill, farro, radicchio, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 691}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1300, "unsaturatedFatContent": "46 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "72 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "95 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1489 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 onion, finely chopped (1 cup)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 cups farro (12 ounces), rinsed and drained", "1 lemon", "3 mini (or Persian) seedless cucumbers (7 ounces)\u00a0", "1 small head radicchio (5 ounces)", "1/3 cup packed finely chopped dill", "4 boneless\u00a0salmon\u00a0fillets (4 ounces each, and about 1-inch thick)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large straight-sided skillet with a lid over medium heat.
