{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Roasted Red Peppers and Goat Cheese", "description": "Years ago, I stayed with an Italian friend in Bologna who worked long hours at his job. By the time he got home, he was hungry, so he\u2019d start water boiling and cast about his tiny kitchen to see what he could use for dinner. Then, to my fascination, he\u2019d whip up a delicious pasta sauce from almost nothing: a few anchovies and some walnuts, or a can of tuna and another of beans. Yesterday\u2019s bread became today\u2019s bread crumbs, browned in olive oil with garlic and tossed with spaghetti, olives, capers and jarred tomato pur\u00e9e.  I try to keep a jar of roasted peppers handy at all times. They\u2019re useful for panini, pizzas and especially pastas like this one. Spanish piquillo peppers are particularly sweet, but bell peppers will do as well. If you have basil, it\u2019s delicious in this dish \u2014 but not required.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/12/07/science/06recipehealth/06recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "goat cheese, pasta, red pepper, healthy, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 173}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 444, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "346 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 cup thinly sliced roasted sweet red peppers", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "4 large basil leaves, cut in slivers chiffonade optional", "3 ounces goat cheese, crumbled", "3/4 pound pasta, any shape"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
