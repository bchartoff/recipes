{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Master Shortbread Recipe", "description": "If you use half a pound of butter in a batch of cookies, it becomes \u201cshort\u201d \u2014 because \u201cshort\u201d means, historically, pastry with a high percentage of fat. Thus shortbread cookies are \u2014 when correctly made \u2014 rich, crumbly and impossible to resist. In their simplest form, they taste mostly of sweet and sweetened butter, so the best butter you can lay your hands on will make a difference here. I like that side-of-the-tongue tingling presence of saltiness, and so I tend to use a little more salt than is strictly necessary, hence the range in the recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/09/magazine/09eat1/09eat1-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butter, flour, sugar, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 170}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 265, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "100 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3/4 cup sugar", "1 egg yolk", "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup cornstarch", "1/2 to 1/4 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use an electric mixer on low speed to combine the butter and sugar, about 30 seconds.
