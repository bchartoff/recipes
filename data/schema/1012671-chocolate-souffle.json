{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Souffl\u00e9", "description": "Some of the most experienced home cooks are afraid of souffl\u00e9s. They\u2019ll never rise, they\u2019ll immediately fall, they\u2019re difficult to make, they\u2019re temperamental. Yet people do want to make souffl\u00e9s \u2014 or want them made for them. Hence this recipe, which is not only not scary, it\u2019s also easy. It can be made ahead of time, it\u2019s rich and light, it will dazzle your significant other (or anyone else), and it requires no more effort than it takes to beat a few eggs.
