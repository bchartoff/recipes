Pound the garlic cloves to a paste with a pinch of salt in the mortar and add to the mixture. Slowly mix in the rest of the oil with a spoon, not being overly concerned with creating an even consistency. Taste and adjust with salt and cayenne. The oil will rise and stay somewhat separate from the chili solids, allowing the harissa to be preserved in the fridge for months. Just stir together before using it. The oil itself is a delicious flavoring agent."}]}
