{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Chicken With Potatoes, Cherry Tomatoes and Herbs", "description": "For this simple bake of chicken, potatoes and tomatoes, Julia Moskin borrowed a technique from the Italian island of Ischia, where rosemary, fennel and other herbs grow wild in the hills. Because the island was formed by volcanic activity (Pompeii is just under 20 miles away), it has natural hot springs, and the sand on some of its beaches is as hot as 350 degrees. When cooking fuel was scarce and expensive, the islanders learned to use the sand as a heat source for cooking. Wrapping the ingredients tightly and subjecting them to steady heat produces a succulent, aromatic dish. If you prefer to brown the ingredients, take the final step of uncovering the pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/dining/jm-chicken/jm-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "cherry tomato, chicken, potato, red chile, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1123}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "53 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "80 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "73 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "1939 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3- to 4-pound) chicken, cut up, or 3 to 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon rosemary leaves (from about 2 sprigs)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 small dried red chiles, crumbled, or 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "2 to 3 pounds large Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered", "12 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes", "1 large yellow onion, quartered and thickly sliced", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "4 to 6 basil\u00a0sprigs, plus 2 tablespoons finely shredded leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pull any lumps of fat off the chicken and discard.
