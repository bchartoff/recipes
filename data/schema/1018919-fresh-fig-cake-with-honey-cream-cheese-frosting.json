{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh-Fig Cake With Honey Cream-Cheese Frosting", "description": "This dense and deeply figgy cake, adapted from Eli's Table in Manhattan, gets its complex flavor from a combination of fresh figs and fig jam, seasoned generously with cinnamon, cardamom and ginger. It\u2019s then filled and topped with cream cheese frosting that is sweetened with a combination of confectioners\u2019 sugar for lightness and honey for richness. Over all, it\u2019s a bit like carrot cake, except softer and sweeter. You can make the cake two to three days ahead and store it, well wrapped or under a cake dome, in the refrigerator. It gets even moister as it sits. If you can\u2019t get fresh figs, chopped peeled apple works nicely as a substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/08/dining/08COOKING-FIG-CAKE/08COOKING-FIG-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cream cheese, fig, honey, jam, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 353}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 889, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "111 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "397 milligrams", "sugarContent": "80 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter, for greasing the pan", "3 cups/384 grams all-purpose flour, more for flouring the pan", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs", "3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons buttermilk or plain yogurt", "3/4 cup/116 grams chopped fresh figs (3 to 4 figs)", "3/4 cup/225 grams fig jam", "3/4 cup/85 grams chopped pecans or walnuts", "12 tablespoons/180 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened", "2 cups/16 ounces/454 grams cream cheese, softened", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 tablespoons/60 grams honey", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 2/3 cups/450 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 cup sliced fresh figs (about 5 figs)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat oven to 325 degrees.
