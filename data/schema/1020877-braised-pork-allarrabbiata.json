The browned pork shoulder braises with fire-roasted tomatoes, red wine and basil in the oven until it becomes fork-tender and breaks down into a rich rag\u00f9. The red-pepper flakes create a gentle heat, while basil adds sweetness. Serve over polenta or toss with tubed pasta, like penne or rigatoni. If serving with pasta, loosen the sauce with a little pasta cooking water to help the sauce coat the pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/12/dining/as-pork-ragu/merlin_168480960_02083adc-f91c-4855-b746-60a1451fe792-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings (about 7 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, one pot, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "basil, canned tomatoes, garlic, pork shoulder, red wine, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 850}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 2 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, trimmed of more than 1/4-inch fat", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "10 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "1 1/2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes", "3 (14-ounce) cans fire-roasted crushed or diced tomatoes", "1 cup red wine", "5 basil sprigs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
