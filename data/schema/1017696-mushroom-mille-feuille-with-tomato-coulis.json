{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom Mille-Feuille With Tomato Coulis", "description": "Rich Torrisi developed this intense and terrific recipe for the menu at Dirty French, one of a number of chic restaurants in downtown Manhattan that he runs with Mario Carbone. It is on one hand a simple dish: thin-sliced mushrooms layered with butter and salt, then pressed and chilled until they resemble the French dessert known as mille-feuille, or \"thousand leaves.\" Saut\u00e9ing a slice of the resulting loaf in a hot pan, and then pairing it with a lovely coulis of fresh tomatoes and herbs? That elevates it to the divine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/20/magazine/20eat/20mag-20eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT13H", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 108}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds king trumpet mushrooms", "3 sticks unsalted butter (1 1/2 cups, or 3/4 pound), melted", "1 pound good yellow tomatoes", "1 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for searing", "Champagne vinegar to taste", "Sugar to taste", "Assorted herbs like parsley, oregano, marjoram, basil, sage and savory"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350.
