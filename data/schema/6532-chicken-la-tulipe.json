{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken la Tulipe", "description": "Jonathan Reynolds brought this recipe to The Times in 2000, from the New York restaurant La Tulipe. He thought it a perfect dish for a man to cook for a woman. (Whether that is also true for men cooking for men and women cooking for women, he said he didn\u2019t know, so we tested it out: It does.) The morels and Cognac are wildly sophisticated additions to what otherwise might be a plain roasted chicken, making the dish an easy, stylish win for newish cooks interested in making an impression on a sweetheart or someone who might become one. Make the cooking \u201cappear effortless,\u201d Mr. Reynolds wrote. \u201cPour things from a great height. Think Fred Astaire, not one of those grunting tennis players.\u201d ", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Reynolds"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/dining/altulipe/altulipe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project, sauces and gravies, times classics", "keywords": "chicken, cognac, dried morels, dry white wine, poultry, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 231}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces dried morels", "2 tablespoons Cognac", "2 tablespoons butter, divided", "1 1/4 cups light cream or creame frache, divided", "1 3 1/2-pound chicken, rinsed (neck, giblets and liver removed)", "1 teaspoon salt, divided in half", "Pinch of cayenne", "1/4 teaspoon pepper", "1/4 cup dry white wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees and let morels soak in Cognac 15 minutes.
