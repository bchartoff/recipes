{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Breakfast Salad", "description": "From the same trend that brought us avocado toast, the breakfasts served in Australian cafes often include bright vegetables arranged in eye-catching ways. Salad is definitely not part of the traditional American breakfast menu, but on a sunny morning the combination of chilled, crunchy greens; protein-rich cheese and eggs; and an eye-opening dressing is hugely appealing. This one was created at Carthage Must Be Destroyed, an airy (and slightly eccentric) Australian-style cafe hidden behind an unmarked entrance in Brooklyn. The chef and owner Amanda Bechara likes to leave the lettuce leaves whole to make it easier to eat with your fingers.\u00a0(You can prepare the vegetables the day before, and skip marinating the feta if you must.) This would also make a lovely lunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/25/dining/25ausrex1/25ausrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT12H30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "australian", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "avocado, feta, romaine, sprouts, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 318}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 569, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "17 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1666 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces feta cheese (not crumbled), preferably a creamy type made with some sheep\u2019s milk", "1 garlic clove, smashed and peeled", "1 dozen black or mixed peppercorns, coarsely cracked", "Extra-virgin olive oil, preferably cold-pressed", "2 large hearts romaine lettuce, outer leaves removed", "2 lemons, halved", "1 avocado, halved, pit removed", "About 2 ounces sprouts, such as alfalfa, clover or rainbow", "2 mini or Kirby cucumbers, cut into spears or sliced", "2 or 3 hard-boiled eggs, at room temperature, peeled and halved", "Flaky salt and coarsely ground black pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 handfuls soft herbs, such as basil, chives, cilantro and mint", "Sourdough toast, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "A day before serving, marinate the cheese: Place feta in a small container with a tight-fitting lid.
