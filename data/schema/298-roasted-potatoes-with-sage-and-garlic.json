It pairs perfectly here with potatoes and stands up well to garlic. Enjoy with your favorite roasted or grilled meat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/16/dining/16COOKING-ROAST-POTATOES-GARLIC1/16COOKING-ROAST-POTATOES-GARLIC1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "garlic, potato, sage, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 225}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 272, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "467 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds small creamer potatoes, halved", "1/3 cup flour", "1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "4 cloves garlic, minced", "1/4 cup chopped sage leaves", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees and place a large, heavy skillet or roasting pan in the oven to heat up.
