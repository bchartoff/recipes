{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Walnut Cake", "description": "I have to thank a couple of people for this recipe: first, the chef Stevie Parle, of Dock Kitchen in London, who published the recipe to inspire this one, and second, the aunt of one of my recipe testers, who made such a standout interpretation that we all marveled over the leftovers the next day in the test kitchen. I just had to try my own version, and here it is, made a touch more celebratory with caramelized walnuts and lashings of whipped cream, both of which can be omitted if you prefer keeping it plain and dairy-free (thereby making it suitable for Passover). The cake is moist and delicious enough as it is. If baking for Passover, you should also be sure to use muscovado sugar (or dark brown sugar) and amaretto that are certified kosher for Passover.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05BAKING4/05BAKING4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "amaretto, walnut, dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 282}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 487, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "355 milligrams", "sugarContent": "49 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Oil or butter, for greasing the pan", "4 large eggs, yolks and whites separated", "1 packed cup/200 grams dark muscovado sugar", "12 ounces/350 grams walnut halves (about 3 1/2 cups), blitzed to the consistency of fine bread crumbs in a food processor", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 tablespoons amaretto", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/80 grams granulated or superfine sugar (caster sugar)", "2 ounces/60 grams walnut halves (1/2 cup)", "Sea salt", "2/3 cup/150 milliliters heavy cream (double cream)", "1/2 teaspoon granulated or superfine sugar (caster sugar)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit/190 degrees Celsius.
