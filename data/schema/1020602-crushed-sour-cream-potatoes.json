{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crushed Sour Cream Potatoes", "description": "These extremely rich, highly textured potatoes are no less luxurious than the silky mashed variety, but they are a lot less work. There\u2019s no ricing, mashing or whipping \u2014 just a simple crush to expose the potatoes\u2019 craggy interior. From here on out, the key word is \u201ccream\u201d: Creamy potatoes meld with the garlicky heavy cream mixture and lots of sour cream. Small (and yes, creamy) potatoes on the waxy side, like a new potato or even a fingerling, work best here, but a more floury potato cut into large chunks would also work in a pinch. Don\u2019t skimp on the black pepper or chives. They truly make this dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/13/dining/11Romanrex3/11Romanrex3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "garlic, heavy cream, potato, sour cream, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 540}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds small, creamy potatoes, no larger than a golf ball, such as gold creamer", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 cups heavy cream", "6 large garlic cloves, crushed", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup sour cream, plus more for serving", "1/2 cup finely chopped chives", "1/3 cup coarsely chopped dill"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook potatoes in a large pot of boiling, salted water until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
