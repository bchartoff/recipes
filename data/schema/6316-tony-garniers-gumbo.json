It calls for all kinds of interesting meats, most of which can be substituted if you can't find them at the store, though the duck is tough to live without. Mr. Garnier picked up the recipe in the 1970s at Jay's Lounge and Cockpit in Cankton, Louisiana, a dive deep in Cajun country where the proprietor would keep a pot of gumbo simmering for when the music and the cockfighting were done for the night. ''I became interested in how to cook it, so I'd sneak back to the kitchen and ask questions,'' Mr. Garnier said. He refined the recipe for years. It is now at its apex.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Asimov"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT7H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun, creole, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "celery, chicken, chicken stock, cooked rice, duck, flour, green pepper, okra, onion, parsley, pheasant sausage, poultry, shrimp, spices, vegetable oil, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 17}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium free-range duck, cut into 8 to 10 pieces", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "Cayenne pepper to taste", "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "Vegetable oil", "1 1/2 large yellow onions, chopped", "2 stalks celery, chopped", "1 1/2 tablespoons chopped garlic", "1 green bell pepper, chopped", "1 pound okra, stemmed and thinly sliced", "6 quarts unsalted chicken or vegetable stock, or unsalted canned broth", "1 tablespoon celery salt", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "6 bay leaves", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce", "1 pound pheasant sausage, hot or mild (see note)", "1 free-range chicken, cut into 8 pieces", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled", "4 scallions, including tops, chopped", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley", "4 cups cooked rice", "File powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
