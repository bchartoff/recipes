{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Cheesy Pasta With Wild Mushrooms", "description": "A more sophisticated take on mac and cheese, this golden-topped casserole has roasted wild mushrooms for a deep, earthy character, and melted fontina for the gooey factor. You can use any kind of mushrooms here. If you can\u2019t get wild ones (also called exotic, and most of them are actually farmed), use whatever is available. The key is to roast them until they are well browned and crisp at the edges so the flavor intensifies. Serve this as a vegetarian main course or as a rich side dish to roast chicken or meats. You can assemble the casserole the day before. Just add a few minutes onto the baking time if it\u2019s cold from the fridge when you pop it into the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/28/multimedia/clark-mushroom-pasta/clark-mushroom-pasta-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, pastas", "keywords": "fontina, orecchiette, wild mushrooms, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 930}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 383, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "367 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound mixed wild or cultivated mushrooms, such as oyster, maitake and shiitake", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus a few grinds", "2 fresh rosemary branches", "1/2 pound orecchiette, farfalle or other short pasta", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup fresh ricotta", "5 ounces fontina cheese, grated (1 1/4 cups)", "2 ounces Parmesan, grated (1/2 cup)", "1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh sage", "1 garlic clove, finely grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
