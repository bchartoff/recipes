{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buffalo Cauliflower", "description": "Cauliflower is a blank canvas that can take on flavors that pack a punch, like Buffalo sauce. It also has lots of craggy edges that the sauce can cling to for maximum flavor. For crisp-edged buffalo cauliflower without a fryer, turn on the broiler. Once the tender florets are roasted, broil them a few minutes so the silky, spicy sauce caramelizes and chars in spots. (A finish under the broiler can also elevate chicken wings coated in Buffalo sauce.) Stir together a quick Ranch-style yogurt sauce for dipping, and get on with the game (or lunch).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/14/dining/as-buffalo-cauliflower/as-buffalo-cauliflower-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 Servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, buttermilk, cauliflower, hot sauce, yogurt, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 368}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 279, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "726 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large head cauliflower (about 2\u00bd pounds), cut into medium and large florets (about 8 cups)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/3 cup Buffalo-style hot sauce", "1/2 cup full-fat yogurt", "1/4 cup buttermilk or mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons finely chopped dill, parsley, and-or chives", "1 1/2 tablespoons white wine vinegar or rice vinegar or lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder or 1 small garlic clove, grated", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees, and place a rack close to the broiler and another in the middle of the oven.
