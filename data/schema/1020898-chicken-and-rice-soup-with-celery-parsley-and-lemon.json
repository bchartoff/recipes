{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Rice Soup With Celery, Parsley and Lemon", "description": "This soup is simultaneously cozy and fresh. It\u2019s just the kind of thing you want to eat when you\u2019re sick and seeking something that\u2019ll perk you up and get you through it. The soup simmers long enough for the rice to start to break down so it thickens the soup. If you prefer a brothier soup that\u2019s predominantly chicken and rice floating in broth, cook just until the rice is tender. Or if you want thick porridge, just keep simmering. (You can\u2019t really overcook chicken thighs.) Lemon juice adds brightness, as does the lively mix of parsley, lemon, garlic and celery leaves strewn on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/25/dining/as-chicken-and-rice-soup/merlin_168780882_75ffa396-429f-4c05-8d99-79d4ae89131b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, grains and rice, poultry, soups and stews", "keywords": "boneless chicken thighs, celery, chicken broth, jasmine rice, parsley, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 590}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 cups chicken broth", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "4 stalks celery, leaves reserved and stalks thinly sliced", "3/4 cup jasmine rice (unrinsed)", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest plus up to 1/2 cup lemon juice (from 2 to 3 lemons)", "1 small garlic clove", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or pot, combine the broth, chicken, celery and rice.
