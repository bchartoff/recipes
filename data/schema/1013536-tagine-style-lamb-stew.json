At that point it is covered and cooked until tender.\n\nWhen I tried the \u201ccold start\u201d approach, substituting a low heating of the lamb with aromatics and a little butter for the usual hard sear in olive oil, it worked like (well, kind of like) magic. The overall flavor of the dish was less robust than one that began with browning, but it was equally flavorful, in a gentler way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/Tagine/Tagine-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, soups and stews", "keywords": "chickpea, lamb, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 748}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 494, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "628 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds lamb shoulder", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 small onion, grated (about 1/3 cup)", "4 cloves garlic, minced", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1/4 cup apricot preserves", "1/3 cup red wine vinegar", "1 20-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "2 cups chicken stock", "1/4 cup raisins", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Cooked couscous, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim excess fat from the lamb and cut into 1-inch cubes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a Dutch oven or other large, heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium-low heat.
