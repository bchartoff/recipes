{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Amaranth Porridge With Grated Apples and Maple Syrup", "description": "Amaranth  is a tiny seed \u2013 it isn\u2019t really a grain, though that is how we treat it \u2013 and has both sweet and grassy overtones. I experimented with preparing it as a polenta, like the teff polenta I made earlier in the week, and seasoning it with nut oil or mixing in a little Parmesan. It worked that way, but I still found that the flavor of this food works better with sweet flavors, and the texture did not benefit from the long oven simmer, the way the teff did. So again, I decided that amaranth is best served as a breakfast porridge. I toasted the seeds in the pan before adding water, and this added a wonderful popcorn dimension to the flavor. The aroma of this cereal as it cooked reminded me of the smell of the whole wheat Ralston Hot Cereal that my mother used to make for me. The amaranth will cook in about 20 minutes on top of the stove. I add milk halfway through the cooking, and the amaranth retains a nice grainy texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/17/science/recipehealthamaranth/recipehealthamaranth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "Serves 1", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 24}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup amaranth", "1/2 cup water", "Pinch of salt", "1/3 cup milk", "1 teaspoon maple syrup", "1/2 small or 1/4 large apple, grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a small saucepan over medium-high heat and add the amaranth seeds.
