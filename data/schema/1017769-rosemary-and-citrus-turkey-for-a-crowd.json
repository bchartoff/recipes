{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rosemary and Citrus Turkey for a Crowd", "description": "This recipe makes things easier on you if you\u2019re feeding a crowd at Thanksgiving. Instead of roasting two birds, or a giant, hard-to-maneuver 22-pounder, borrow a trick that caterers use at large weddings. There\u2019s the official wedding cake for show, while in the kitchen there are sheet pans full of the same cake recipe, baked into flat, easily sliceable pieces.\n\nUsing the same logic, here you\u2019ll find a recipe for one whole turkey roasted for that Norman Rockwell moment. Then, pans of easy-to-carve turkey parts are cooked in the same oven at the same time. Monitor everything carefully: The whole bird takes the longest to roast, while the parts roast in about half the time, the white meat often finishing before the dark. You will need a large roasting pan with a rack, and two 9-by-13-inch baking pans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/27/dining/27COOKING-WEDDINGCOMBOalt/27COOKING-WEDDINGCOMBOalt-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "20 to 24 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 216}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (10- to 12-pound) whole turkey", "8 pounds bone-in turkey parts (see notes)", "4 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt", "2 tablespoons black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon allspice", "6 garlic cloves, grated on a microplane or minced", "Finely grated zest of 2 lemons", "Finely grated zest of 2 oranges (save the oranges for juicing)", "2 bunches rosemary", "1 bunch thyme", "3 white onions, peeled, halved and sliced", "4 large carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch coins", "3 celery stalks, sliced 1/2-inch thick", "2 apples, cored and sliced", "Dry white wine, as needed", "3/4 cup melted butter or olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove giblets from inside the turkey; reserve for stock or gravy.
