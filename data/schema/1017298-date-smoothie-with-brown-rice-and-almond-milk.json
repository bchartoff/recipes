{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Date Smoothie With Brown Rice and Almond Milk", "description": "This is inspired by Bryant Terry\u2019s recipe for date-sweetened almond milk, which I came across in his wonderful cookbook \u201cAfro-Vegan.\u201d You could use commercial almond milk, but it will taste much richer if you make your own. Blanch and skin almonds (it goes quickly), soak overnight, blend and strain. The smoothie is a simple one, subtly sweetened by the dates, and mildly nutty. If you want to introduce another flavor into the mix add a half banana. I liked it both ways but I think I prefer the simpler version, so I have made the banana optional.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/17/science/recipehealthdate/recipehealthdate-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 large or 2 small servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, snack, non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 85}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup cooked brown rice", "3 dates, pitted", "1 cup pure almond milk, preferably homemade", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "A couple of shakes of cinnamon (about 1/8 teaspoon), plus additional for sprinkling if desired", "2 to 3 ice cubes, to taste", "1/2 banana (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in the jar of a blender and blend at high speed until smooth.
