Perhaps it\u2019s the dried fruit or chicken braised in a sauce (instead of being striped on the grill) that appeals to the season. But it\u2019s an easy winner for those first dinners when fall appears. Though plumped raisins are called for, other dried fruit, like diced figs or quartered prunes work well, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/dining/19pairrex/merlin_143246160_4e8de789-b8b9-4e29-8314-558a2e3de269-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "chicken, glace de viande, shallots, verjus, walnut oil, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 14}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 744, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "837 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup black raisins", "1/2 cup brandy", "1 chicken, cut in 8 pieces", "3 tablespoons walnut oil", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1/4 cup minced shallots", "3/4 cup verjus (see note)", "2 tablespoons glace de viande or de volaille (concentrated meat or chicken stock) or packaged roasted chicken base", "3 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place raisins in a bowl, add brandy and set aside to plump overnight or for at least 8 hours."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chicken: Dry chicken pieces.
