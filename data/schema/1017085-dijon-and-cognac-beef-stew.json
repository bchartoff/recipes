{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dijon and Cognac Beef Stew", "description": "This rich, comforting stew was brought to The Times by Regina Schrambling in 2001, in the dark days immediately following the attacks on the World Trade Center. The accompanying article was an ode to the therapeutic benefits of cooking and baking: \"Whoever said cooking should be entered into with abandon or not at all had it wrong. Going into it when you have no hope is sometimes just what you need to get to a better place. Long before there were antidepressants, there was stew.\" This one, while complex in flavor, is not difficult to prepare, but it cannot be rushed. Make it when you have the time to indulge in the meditative qualities of chopping, saut\u00e9ing, reducing, braising, waiting and tasting. You will be rewarded with an exceptionally flavorful dish that is just as satisfying to eat as it was to cook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Regina Schrambling"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/30/dining/rs-dijon-and-cognac-beef-stew/rs-dijon-and-cognac-beef-stew-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef chuck, cognac, pommery mustard, salt pork, shallot, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3692}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 609, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1167 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4\u00a0pound salt pork, diced", "1\u00a0large onion, finely diced", "3\u00a0shallots, chopped", "2 to 4\u00a0tablespoons unsalted butter", "2\u00a0pounds beef chuck, in 1-inch cubes", "2\u00a0tablespoons all-purpose flour", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2\u00a0cup Cognac", "2\u00a0cups beef stock", "1/2\u00a0cup Dijon mustard", "4\u00a0tablespoons Pommery mustard or other whole-grain Dijon mustard", "4\u00a0large carrots, peeled and cut into half-moon slices", "1/2\u00a0pound mushrooms, stemmed, cleaned and quartered", "1/4\u00a0cup red wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place salt pork in a Dutch oven over low heat, and cook until fat is rendered.
