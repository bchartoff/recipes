{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Tapioca Pudding With Cinnamon Sugar Br\u00fbl\u00e9e", "description": "This pudding offers you both the satisfying crack of using your spoon to break through a br\u00fbl\u00e9e topping and the sensation of dipping that spoon into fluffy pudding. Tapioca generally isn\u2019t baked, but it is easier than cooking it on top of the stove. And once the pudding is in the oven you can leave it alone, as opposed to the stovetop method, which requires frequent stirring to prevent scorching. The use of pearl tapioca makes for a springy texture, and cinnamon in the topping adds a bit of spice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/29/dining/29APPE_SPAN/29APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings.
