{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Poppy Muffins", "description": "From supermarket aisles to those backlight bakery cases in every diner across the country, lemon poppy-seed muffins are ubiquitous, and easy to love. Buttery and soft, tart and sweet, they are soothing in their simplicity, while seeds add just a bit of crunch. This version gets a healthy dose of lemony tang thanks to an ample amount of grated zest and a zippy lemon-juice glaze. It\u2019s important to spring for fresh fruit here, as opposed to anything that comes in a plastic bottle. The bright flavor of real lemon goes a long way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/20/dining/20COOKING-LEMONPOPPYSEEDMUFFIN2/20COOKING-LEMONPOPPYSEEDMUFFIN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, quick breads", "keywords": "lemon, poppy seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 463}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 293, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "199 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), melted and cooled slightly", "1/2 cup whole milk", "1/2 cup sour cream", "2 large eggs", "2 tablespoons freshly grated lemon zest (from 2 large lemons)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "4 teaspoons poppy seeds", "1 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 to 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
