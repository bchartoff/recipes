{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Harra Bi Isbaou", "description": "This hearty Middle Eastern stew of lentils and pasta-like dumplings (a small Italian pasta is most commonly used today) is flavored with a tangy-savory mix of tamarind and lemon juice combined with saut\u00e9ed garlic and cilantro. It is then topped with crispy onions and bread. It can be served at any temperature, but it\u2019s important that the dish be served with all of its garnishes. \n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s called harra bi isbaou (which means 'burned finger' in Arabic) because the peasants who invented it couldn\u2019t wait for it to cool down to eat it, so they burned their fingers,\u201d said Umm Ali, a home cook from the Aleppo suburbs who fled to Beirut with her family in 2013.
