{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooked Red Wine Beef Stew", "description": "Red wine and beef are such an elemental combination that it's worth mastering the technique for a great stew: Saut\u00e9 the ingredients quickly to caramelize and reduce, then cook through very slowly (preferably in a low oven, but see our Notes on how to cook in the slow cooker or pressure cooker). You can use any wine you like, since it will be cooked for a long time: the alcohol, acidity and fruitiness that make wine lovely in the glass are not so nice in the bowl; they have to be tamed by simmering. But the tangy, syrupy taste they leave behind is an ideal counterpoint to red meat. Celery is optional because some don't like it, but note that it's not eaten: It just provides a green flavor note alongside the sweet carrots and earthy potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/04/dining/04recipelab/04recipelab-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef stew meat, bouquet garni, red wine, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 691}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 447, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "942 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 to 4 pounds well-marbled beef stew meat, preferably chuck, cut into large (2-by-2 1/2-inch) pieces", "2 large sprigs fresh thyme", "2 bay leaves", "About a dozen juniper berries", "1/2 bottle red wine (not sweet)", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 garlic cloves (1 smashed and peeled, 3 minced)", "4 tablespoons vegetable oil", "3 stalks celery (optional)", "3 large carrots", "2 onions", "1 large, starchy potato, such as Idaho", "3 ounces pancetta (or French ventr\u00e8che), diced small (optional)", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "Bouquet garni (2 sprigs fresh thyme, 2 sprigs fresh rosemary or parsley, 2 bay leaves, 6 juniper berries, 4 whole cloves, 1 teaspoon dried orange peel, wrapped in cheesecloth and tied)", "1/2 bottle red wine", "Chicken broth, as needed", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves (or use additional parsley), for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate the meat: In a large bowl, combine all the marinade ingredients.
