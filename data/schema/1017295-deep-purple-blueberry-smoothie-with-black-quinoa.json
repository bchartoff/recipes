{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Deep Purple Blueberry Smoothie With Black Quinoa", "description": "My idea for this week\u2019s Recipes for Health was to match grains and fruit by color and make nourishing smoothies. For this one I could have also used any of the black or purple rices on the market, such as Alter Eco\u2019s purple jasmine rice, Lotus Food\u2019s Forbidden Rice or Lundberg Black Japonica. I happened to have a full bag of black quinoa in the pantry, so that\u2019s what I went for and it worked beautifully. You can also use fresh blueberries for this, but when they are not in season, frozen will do fine and will eliminate the need for ice cubes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/17/science/recipehealthpurpleNOTwell/recipehealthpurpleNOTwell-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 generous serving or 2 small servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, snack, non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 71}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 298, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "11 milligrams", "sugarContent": "41 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup cooked black quinoa or 1/4 cup cooked black rice", "1 cup frozen organic blueberries or fresh blueberries (about 4 1/2 ounces)", "1/2 large or 1 small ripe banana", "1 teaspoon pomegranate molasses", "3/4 cup blood orange juice or regular orange juice", "A few drops to 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice, to taste", "2 ice cubes if using fresh blueberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in the jar of a blender and blend at high speed until smooth.
