Feel free to experiment with the \u201cpickling spices\u201d called for below \u2014 you can customize them, if you like, from a base of coriander seeds, black peppercorns and garlic \u2014 but please do not omit the curing salt, which gives the meat immense flavor in addition to a reddish hue. (It\u2019s perfectly safe, Mr. Ruhlman exhorts: \u201cIt\u2019s not a chemical additive. Most of the nitrates we eat come in vegetables!\u201d) Finally, if you want a traditional boiled dinner, slide quartered cabbage and some peeled carrots into the braise for the final hour or so of cooking.
