It is a good source of phosphorus and a very good source of magnesium, but apparently the yields were disappointing to farmers and it never really caught on among consumers. I had sort of forgotten about it until I came across it again recently at Bob\u2019s Red Mill. I like its chewy texture and earthy flavor, both very similar to farro or wheatberries. Any hearty, toothsome grain works well in this salad, so I\u2019ve given you a choice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/15/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "dairy-free, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, vegan, vegetarian, endive, mushroom, pearl barley, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 342, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "527 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup pearl barley, brown rice or triticale", "3 cups chicken stock, vegetable stock, or water for barley or triticale, 2 cups for brown rice", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1/4 pound shiitakes, sliced", "1 garlic clove, minced", "4 leaves fresh sage, cut in very thin slivers", "1/4 pound white or cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced ", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, or a mixture of parsley and other herbs such as chives, dill, tarragon, marjoram", "1 Belgian endive, red or green, cut crosswise in thin rounds (about 1/4 inch)", "Freshly ground pepper", "Shaved Parmesan (optional)", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "Salt to taste", "1 small garlic clove, minced or pureed", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil ", "2 tablespoons walnut oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using brown rice or barley, toast first: Heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and add the barley or brown rice.
