{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salted Dark Chocolate Cake With Ganache Frosting", "description": "Layer cakes are pretty, but for many, they require far too much work to make on a regular basis. This cake, adapted from \u201cModern Baking: Cakes, Cookies and Everything in Between\u201d by Donna Hay, may find a place in your recipe repertoire. It requires just two bowls \u2014 one for the cake and one for the frosting \u2014 and there\u2019s no need to separate wet and dry ingredients. You just toss everything into a bowl and stir. The end result is a tender, sophisticated cake slathered with a glossy milk chocolate-sour cream ganache. Ms. Hay sprinkled black sea salt around the edges of her cake with stunning effect, but traditional white sea salt looks beautiful, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/05/dining/05bookrex1/05bookrex1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dark chocolate, milk chocolate, sour cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 256}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1009, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "91 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "68 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "41 grams", "sodiumContent": "591 milligrams", "sugarContent": "58 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/310 grams self-rising flour, sifted (see note)", "1/2 cup/45 grams cocoa powder, sifted", "1 1/2 cups/295 grams sugar", "4 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters whole milk", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/255 grams unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled", "7 ounces/200 grams dark chocolate, melted and slightly cooled", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon flaky sea salt, white or black", "1 cup/240 milliliters sour cream", "14 ounces/400 grams milk chocolate, melted and slightly cooled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
