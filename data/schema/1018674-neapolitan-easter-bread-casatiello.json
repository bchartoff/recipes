{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Neapolitan Easter Bread (Casatiello)", "description": "This recipe is steeped in Neapolitan tradition: It\u2019s made the day after the big Easter feast, as a way to use up leftover cheese and meat. An Easter Monday picnic is also a custom, so the fact that all the goodies are already wrapped up in the bread makes it a very transportable option. The herby pesto and Gruy\u00e8re, though, are my own nontraditional additions. This can be baked and presented in various ways, but the ring both looks great and has some nice symbolism \u2014 the circle of life and renewal associated with spring in general and Easter in particular. A very large (10-inch, or 24-centimeter) tube pan with a flat bottom is perfect, but you can improvise with a cake pan, creating a hole in the middle with an overturned bowl or ball of aluminum foil placed in the middle of the pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05BAKING1/05BAKING1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, breads", "keywords": "basil, gruy\u00e8re, parmesan, parsley, salami, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 84}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 255, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "565 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/70 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "3 tablespoons/45 grams fine semolina flour", "1 lightly packed cup/15 grams basil leaves", "1 lightly packed cup/15 grams parsley leaves", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more for seasoning", "4 cups/500 grams bread flour (strong flour), more for dusting", "3 teaspoons/10 grams instant yeast (fast-action dried yeast)", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters lukewarm water", "1 salami log (6 ounces/160 grams), rind removed and cut into 1/4-inch/1/2-centimeter cubes (1 heaping cup)", "4 1/2 ounces/130 grams Gruy\u00e8re, cut into 1/4-inch/1/2-centimeter cubes (1 cup)", "2 ounces/70 grams Parmesan, coarsely grated (1 lightly packed cup)", "2 large eggs, hard-boiled, peeled and coarsely grated", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grease a 10-inch or 24-centimeter tube pan with a flat bottom with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil.
