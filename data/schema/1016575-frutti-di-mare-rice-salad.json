{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Frutti di Mare Rice Salad", "description": "In the southern Mediterranean, savory rice salads are popular and are great for a light summer lunch or supper. The rice is first boiled in well-salted water like pasta and dressed with a zesty vinaigrette. This version is topped with a pile of briefly cooked shrimp, calamari and mussels, and summery ingredients like cherry tomatoes, green beans and basil. The salad is served at room temperature, and most of it can be prepared in advance, so it is exactly what you want when the weather is sweltering.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/18/dining/18KITCH1_SPAN/18KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "main course, side dish, rice, shrimp, squid, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 497, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "748 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups short-grain Italian rice, such as Carnaroli or Arborio", "1 large shallot, finely diced", "2 garlic cloves, smashed to a paste", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1/2 cup olive oil", "Salt and pepper", "1 small bay leaf", "1 sprig thyme", "1/2 pound small shrimp, peeled and deveined", "1/2 pound cleaned squid, cut in thin rings", "1 pound small mussels, scrubbed", "1/2 pound slender green beans", "1/2 pound cherry tomatoes, halved", "Handful of basil leaves, for garnish", "2 tablespoons finely cut chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a gallon of well-salted water to a boil then add rice.
