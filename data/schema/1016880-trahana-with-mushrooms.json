{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Trahana With Mushrooms", "description": "When trahana is cooked in broth, the broth thickens slightly, as it does when you make risotto with Arborio rice. I make this savory, comforting mixture of mushrooms and trahana the same way I make risotto, adding the broth gradually and stirring vigorously from time to time. You may not need to use all of the broth but it is good to have this much just in case. If you make it ahead and reheat, you will want to add some broth, so don\u2019t throw out what you don\u2019t use.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/21/science/24recipehealthmushrooms/24recipehealthmushrooms-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 35}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "828 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce (about 1 heaped cup) dried mushrooms, preferably porcinis", "1 quart vegetable or chicken stock", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup finely diced red or yellow onion", "1 1/2 pounds fresh cultivated or wild mushrooms (or a mix), cleaned, trimmed and cut in thick slices", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, or 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, to taste", "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016876-homemade-sour-bulgur-trahana-from-ikaria\">1 1/2 cups sour bulgur trahana</a>", "1/2 cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc", "Freshly ground pepper", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1/4 cup; more to taste) (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place dried mushrooms in a bowl or in a pyrex measuring cup and pour on 3 cups boiling water.
