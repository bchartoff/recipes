{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Meringue Tart", "description": "The celebrated pastry chef Dolester Miles learned to bake in a small town called Bessemer, outside Birmingham, Ala. She took the tastes of Southern desserts passed down from her mother and her aunt, and elevated them with fine-dining technique she has picked up in her more than 30 years at the Birmingham restaurants Highlands Bar & Grill, Chez Fonfon and Bottega Caf\u00e9. This lemon meringue tart, reminiscent of a Southern icebox cake but with a French feel, is a perfect example. She stirs in white chocolate to give the curd a luscious mouth feel, and finishes it with a drift of soft Swiss meringue toasted with a blowtorch. A few seconds under the broiler will work, too. She cautions cooks never to take their eyes off the tart during that final step. \u201cIt\u2019ll get away from you fast,\u201d she said.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/30/dining/30pastryrex1/30pastryrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, lemon, white chocolate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 326}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 388, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "115 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/191 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/82 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/113 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick), cubed", "2 egg yolks", "4 large eggs", "1 1/4 cups/252 grams granulated sugar", "Zest from 2 lemons", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into large pieces", "4 ounces white chocolate, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, place flour, confectioners\u2019 sugar and salt, and quickly pulse to combine.
