{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peter Reinhart\u2019s Whole Wheat Bagels", "description": "When I order a whole wheat bagel in a coffee shop what I get is a white bagel with a little bit of whole wheat flour thrown in. These bagels are different; they are truly whole grain. I\u2019ve been enthralled lately with Peter Reinhart\u2019s new cookbook, Bread Revolution. Reinhart, a baking teacher and cookbook author whom I have long admired, has discovered the magic of sprouted whole grain flours, which he uses in the recipes in this book (you can get sprouted whole wheat flour in whole foods stores and from several online sources). He also illuminates many of the mysteries of baking with whole grain flours in general. The recipes that I have tried work with regular whole wheat flour as well; I have Community Grains whole wheat flour on hand but did not have sprouted whole wheat flour when I was developing this week\u2019s Recipes for Health, so that is what I used. One of the important things I learned \u2013 relearned really \u2013 from Peter is that when you make dough with whole wheat flour, which absorbs liquid more readily than white flour, it is important to give the dough a little time to absorb the water so that it will be workable. So there is a rest after you add the liquid to the flour; you\u2019ll think the dough is going to be way too wet, then it miraculously firms up, in very little time. Reinhart has two methods for bagels in his cookbook; one requires an overnight rest in the refrigerator after shaping (that is the method I have used in the past), the other, made with sprouted wheat flour, can be boiled and baked after rising and shaping. If you use sprouted whole wheat flour Reinhart says the overnight rise isn\u2019t required because the sprouted wheat allows the bagels to develop optimum flavor in a shorter time. I couldn\u2019t discern much of a difference between the flavor of my overnight regular whole wheat bagels and those I made with the shorter rise; and the ones I made with the shorter rise were prettier. Barley malt is the traditional sweetener used in bagel dough and in the water bath, but either honey or agave syrup can be substituted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/30/science/recipehealthbagels/recipehealthbagels-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "8 bagels", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, snack, breads", "keywords": "high fiber, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 105}, "recipeIngredient": ["510 grams  / about 4 1/4 cups sprouted whole wheat flour or whole wheat flour", "1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast", "1 2/3 cups plus 1 1/2 teaspoons / 408 milliliters lukewarm water", "1 tablespoon barley malt, agave syrup, or honey", "2 tablespoons baking soda, malt syrup or honey for boiling water bath", "Cornmeal or semolina flour for baking sheets", "2 to 4 tablespoons topping of your choice: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, nigella seeds, onion flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle or in a large bowl combine flour, salt and yeast.

Turn out the dough and divide into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball by placing on an unfloured work surface under a cupped hand and rolling it around and around. Lightly oil work surface if dough sticks. To shape bagels, using both hands roll each ball into an 8-inch long rope, tapering from the middle of the dough to the ends. Moisten the last inch of each end, place one end on the palm of your hand and wrap the rope around your hand, bringing the other end between your thumb and forefinger. Overlap the ends by about 2 inches and stick the ends together. Press onto the work surface and roll back and forth to seal, then lay the ring down and even out the thickness with your fingers. The hole should be about 2 inches in diameter. Place on the prepared baking sheets. (Another way to shape the bagels is to press your thumbs through the center of the balls, then gradually pull apart and shape the bagel with your hands by rotating the dough around your thumbs, until the hole is 2 inches in diameter; I find that, although this method is a bit quicker, the bagels tend to close up, so I prefer the rope method). Place on prepared baking sheet(s), at least 1 inch apart. Lightly oil tops and cover loosely with plastic wrap."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Allow bagels to proof for 30 to 60 minutes, until just beginning to swell and rise.
