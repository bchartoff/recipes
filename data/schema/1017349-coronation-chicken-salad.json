{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coronation Chicken Salad", "description": "Back in 1953, long before the Los Angeles chef Roy Choi started making Korean tacos, a different kind of cross-cultural mash-up was minted in England as a way to celebrate the crowning of Queen Elizabeth II. Coronation Chicken, a dish with Indian flavors, has since \u201cbecome a staple in the U.K.,\u201d said Nicky Perry, whose almost-a-quarter-century-old West Village shrine to British food, Tea & Sympathy, serves it as the filling for one of the restaurant\u2019s signature sandwiches. \u201cThere is such a huge Indian population in the U.K. that the two cuisines have become somewhat intertwined.\u201d By now it is a mainstay of the American picnic basket, too, and its undercurrents of sweetness (from apricots and mango chutney) and spice (from curry powder) are easy to achieve. Use soft bread, so that the chicken salad doesn\u2019t go squirting out the sides with each bite. And cutting off the crusts? Go right ahead. There is no shame in that.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/15/dining/15CHEFRECIPE/15CHEFRECIPE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, sandwiches", "keywords": "apricot, chicken breast, mango chutney, red wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 281}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 683, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "46 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "716 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Kosher salt, as needed", "Fresh black pepper, as needed", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large yellow onion, diced", "1/2 cup red wine", "6 tablespoons mango chutney", "1/4 cup tomato pur\u00e9e", "3 tablespoons curry powder", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1 fresh or dried bay leaf", "1 cup mayonnaise", "3 ounces dried apricots, finely chopped (about 15 apricots)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
