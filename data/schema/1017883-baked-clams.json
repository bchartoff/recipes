It contains some of the usual suspects \u2014 onion and celery \u2014 and some unusual ones, like clam juice and vermouth. Importantly, it doesn't require clam shucking, which is a dangerous occupation, best avoided unless you are very brave.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/13/magazine/13eat1/13mag-13eat-t_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings (or 2 if you love clams)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "clams, cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 179, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "474 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["24-30 littleneck or cherrystone clams*", "3 tablespoons clam juice", "3 tablespoons water", "2 tablespoons dry vermouth", "1 cup combined (any combination) sliced green or plain white garlic, finely sliced leek, chopped celery, fennel or fennel top", "3 tablespoons butter plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, separated", "2 tablespoons heavy cream", "1/4 cup chopped celery leaf", "1 tablespoon chopped fennel frond", "1 tablespoon chopped chervil (if available; if not, use more celery leaves or fennel fronds)", "3 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the clams very well.
