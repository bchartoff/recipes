{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Asparagus and Scallion Salad", "description": "In this hearty, many-textured salad, soft, roasted asparagus is tossed with chewy whole grains and crisp, sweet caramelized scallions. You can use freekeh or farro here for the grains. Both are whole-wheat kernels, but the freekeh has a slightly smoky note from being toasted, while the farro is nuttier-tasting. You can prepare the freekeh or farro ahead and let it marinate in the dressing for up to six hours, but it\u2019s best to roast the asparagus and scallions within an hour of serving. Don\u2019t use pecorino Romano here, it\u2019s too sharp. If you can\u2019t find a young pecorino, use a young manchego or even a nice Cheddar, and serve this as a light main course or a salad course to a more substantial meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/10/dining/10APPE1/10APPE1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "asparagus, farro, freekeh, Pecorino Rossellino, scallion, main course, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 386}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 163, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "456 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt, as needed", "1/4 cup freekeh or farro", "2 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons lime juice", "1 small garlic clove, grated on a Microplane or minced", "Fine sea salt and black pepper, to taste", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1 bunch asparagus (1 pound), woody ends trimmed", "1 bunch scallions (about 5 ounces), halved lengthwise and crosswise to form 2-inch-long ribbons", "3 ounces (3 cups) salad greens, such as baby arugula", "Pecorino Rossellino or other young sheep\u2019s milk cheese, as needed (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a small pot of heavily salted water to a boil, stir in freekeh or farro, cover, and simmer until al dente, 20 to 30 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together 2 teaspoons soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, and pinch salt and pepper.
