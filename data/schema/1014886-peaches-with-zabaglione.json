{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peaches With Zabaglione", "description": "You will need fresh peaches for this dish, which requires a bit of finesse. Zabaglione is a traditional egg custard flavored with musky sweet Marsala wine. Other sweet wines may also be used, like sherry or spumante. It takes just a few minutes to make, whisking over a double boiler. Zabaglione can be served hot, but in summer it is better cool. The faint butterscotch caramel-y flavor seems custom-made to accompany peaches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/28/dining/28help2/17KITCH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, dry white wine, marsala, peach, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 68}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 169, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "9 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 egg yolks", "6 tablespoons sugar", "1/2 cup dry Marsala wine", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "4 large peaches", "1/4 cup raspberries, for garnish (optional)", "Raspberry pur\u00e9e, see note (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the zabaglione: In a double boiler or a bowl set over rapidly simmering water, whisk egg yolks and sugar together.
