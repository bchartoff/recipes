{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Gorgonzola and Beet Green Sandwich", "description": "This dish  is the one that inspired me to devote a week of Recipes for Health to toaster-oven vegetable and grilled cheese sandwiches. I made it one night after a day  preparing enough quiche to feed 80 for a book signing. When I got home I had still  more quiches to make in my own kitchen, and the last thing I wanted to do was cook dinner for myself. \n\nBut I was hungry. So I looked in the refrigerator and found a bowl of beet greens that I\u2019d blanched a day or two earlier, and roasted beets that had once been attached to those greens. I pulled a couple of slices of bread from the freezer, looked in my cheese bin, and here  is what I slapped together. \n\nI loved it so much that I made it again the next night. It\u2019s always a good idea to blanch greens as soon as you get them home from the market. You never know when you\u2019ll want to use them in a pinch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/27/science/26recipehealth/26recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves 1", "recipeCuisine": "american, french, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 274, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "561 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large slices whole-wheat country bread (3 ounces total)", "1/2 garlic clove (optional)", "About 3/4 ounce (3 tablespoons crumbled) Gorgonzola or creamy blue cheese", "1/3 cup chopped blanched beet greens", "Chopped fresh herbs such as parsley, thyme, rosemary, marjoram (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small or 1/2 medium beet, sliced thin"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rub surface of one  slice of bread with the cut clove of garlic if desired.
