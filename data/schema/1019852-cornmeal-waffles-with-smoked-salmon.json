For a savory approach, they are embellished with smoked salmon, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and caviar, perfect for a celebratory soiree, midnight supper or brunch. Serve a whole waffle or cut in quarters for appetizers. If you don\u2019t have a waffle iron, the batter can also be used to make pancakes or blini.
