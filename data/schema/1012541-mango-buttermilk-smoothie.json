{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mango Buttermilk Smoothie", "description": "This mango-banana-strawberry smoothie is inspired by lassi, the creamy yogurt drinks popular throughout India. It's as easy to make as a smoothie should be. Just toss everything into a blender \u2013 the flesh of an entire mango, a handful of strawberries, half of a banana, a cup of buttermilk, a bit of honey and a few ice cubes \u2013 then blend to cool and creamy perfection. If you don't have fresh mango, frozen works just as well, and if you don't have buttermilk on hand (who does?), plain old yogurt will do just fine. Add a splash of milk to loosen if it gets too thick.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/05/20/health/20receiphealth_600/20receiphealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "One 16-ounce or two 8-ounce servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, quick, shakes and smoothies", "keywords": "buttermilk, mango, strawberries, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, nut-free, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 77}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 heaped cup fresh or frozen ripe mango", "1 cup buttermilk", "1 teaspoon honey", "1/2 medium size ripe banana", "4 frozen strawberries", "2 or 3 ice cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all of the ingredients in a blender, and blend at high speed until smooth."}]}
