{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fruit Galette", "description": "This basic galette recipe can be tailored to fit whatever fruit you have on hand. The key is to scale the amount of sugar and cornstarch. Generally speaking, tart stone fruits (apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, sour cherries) need a greater amount of both sugar and cornstarch while figs, grapes, berries and Bing cherries tend to need less. If you\u2019re unsure, add the sugar gradually, tasting as you go. Spreading a thin layer of jam over the rolled out dough before adding the filling bumps up the fruit flavor. You can match the jam flavors to your fruit or mix it up for a contrast. And if you don\u2019t want to add lemon zest to the fruit, consider the seeds from a vanilla bean, ground spices, or some minced candied ginger instead. You can make the dough up to three days ahead, but this galette is at its best served the same day it was baked.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/20/multimedia/clark-gallete/clark-gallete-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 549}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 321, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "195 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups/165 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon/15 grams sugar", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams fine sea salt", "1 large egg", "Heavy cream, as needed", "1 stick/113 grams unsalted butter, cut into big pieces", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon/4 grams grated lemon zest (optional)", "3 cups summer fruit of your choice (berries, stone fruit, figs), sliced or cubed if necessary", "1/2 cup to 3/4 cup/100 to 150 grams sugar, to taste", "Pinch of salt", "Juice and grated zest of 1/2 lemon (optional)", "3 to 4 tablespoons/25 to 35 grams cornstarch"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the crust:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, or in a large bowl, pulse or mix together flour, sugar and salt.
