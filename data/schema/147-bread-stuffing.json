{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bread Stuffing", "description": "Mark Bittman writes that this bread stuffing, based on a James Beard recipe, has been a staple on his Thanksgiving table for decades. First you make fresh bread crumbs: just whiz a few cups of slightly stale cubes of decent bread (crust and all, unless it\u2019s super-hard) in a food processor. Keep the crumbs very, very coarse. Cook them with plenty of butter (yes, you can use olive oil) and good seasonings. Baked in a pan, this is delicious, with or without gravy. You could use it to stuff the turkey if you\u2019d like \u2014 but once you've tried it cooked on its own, you won't look back.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/26/dining/26COOKING_STUFFING2/26COOKING_STUFFING2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 cups, enough for a 12-pound bird", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "bread crumbs, fall, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 787}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 287, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "311 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter", "1 cup chopped onion", "1/2 cup pine nuts or chopped walnuts", "6 to 8 cups coarse fresh bread crumbs (see tip)", "1 tablespoon minced fresh tarragon or sage leaves, or 1 teaspoon dried tarragon or sage, crumbled", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup chopped scallions", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter over medium heat in a large, deep skillet, Dutch oven or casserole.
