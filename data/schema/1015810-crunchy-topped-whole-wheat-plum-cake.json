{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy-Topped Whole-Wheat Plum Cake", "description": "When blue-black prune plums come into season in the fall, this cake must be made. The recipe was created by the reporter Marian Burros well before The New York Times went digital; each fall, she would grumble about having to print it, by popular demand, once again. It is absurdly simple (just plum halves nestled into batter), but somehow the liveliness of fruit, sugar, and spice on top of plain cake brings out the best of both worlds. In 2010, the recipe got an update with whole-grain flour that works well with the red and black plums of summer. You can also make it with cherries and peaches.
