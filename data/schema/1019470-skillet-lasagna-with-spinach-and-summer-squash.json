{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Lasagna With Spinach and Summer Squash", "description": "Lasagna in the summer? It\u2019s fine food for those long, breezy summer days when you need to fill your belly without turning on the oven. This one-pan stovetop lasagna is a true crowd-pleaser, with rich tomato, oozing cheese and just enough squash and spinach to skip salad for the night. Using no-cook lasagna, you can cook this entirely over a low flame, covered. (Use foil if you don\u2019t have a lid that fits your pan.) Be sure to start with a well-seasoned cast-iron pan, and never let the tomato sauce boil, which can be hard on your pan and on the flavor of your sauce. If your cast-iron seasoning isn\u2019t in tip-top shape, try this in a stainless-steel skillet instead; you\u2019ll still get all the depth and aroma, and that same stove-to-table ease that will make this a repeat meal all year long.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/dining/sc-skillet-lasagna/sc-skillet-lasagna--articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "baby spinach, lasagna noodles, squash, zucchini, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 402}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 579, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1158 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium onion, thinly sliced", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 zucchini, chopped (6 ounces)", "1 yellow squash, chopped (10 ounces)", "2 packed cups baby spinach leaves", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "8 sheets (half a 9-ounce package) no-cook or oven-ready lasagna noodles", "8 ounces fresh ricotta cheese (about 1 cup)", "1 1/2 ounces finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving (about 1/3 cup)", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced", "Handful of small basil leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a well-seasoned large cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat.
