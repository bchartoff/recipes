{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kumquat and Chocolate Yule Log", "description": "This festive dessert is an absolute showstopper \u2014 and its striking results outweigh the effort. We've updated the traditional b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl with more adventurous flavors, taking a coffee-scented chocolate cake base, layering it with a date-studded mascarpone cream and a bright kumquat marmalade, and crowning it with dramatic caramel shards, meringue spikes and candied citrus. If you can\u2019t find kumquats, you can use tangerines \u2014 and if you're short on time, you can even use a good quality store-bought marmalade instead. The cake can be assembled up to 8 hours ahead, but hold off on trimming it with the toppings until you're ready to serve.\nYou\u2019ll also have extra meringue mixture because that is what is needed in the bowl to be able to whip to stiff peaks. Don\u2019t waste the remaining mixture: Pipe it into small kisses and bake at 200 degrees Fahrenheit/95 degrees Celsius until dry on the outside and slightly chewy inside, about 1 hour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/19/dining/19ottorex1/19ottorex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, project", "keywords": "caramel, cognac, instant coffee, kumquats, mascarpone, medjool dates, star anise, tangerine, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 204}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 291, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "132 milligrams", "sugarContent": "42 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound/350 grams kumquats or tangerines", "3 whole star anise", "2 cinnamon sticks", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or extract", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar (caster sugar)", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "2 tablespoons orange juice", "1 tablespoon Cognac", "2 1/2 tablespoons/35 grams unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the baking pan (baking tin)", "2 ounces/70 grams dark chocolate (70 percent cocoa solids), finely chopped, plus extra shavings for garnish", "1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons/50 grams all-purpose flour (plain flour)", "1/2 teaspoon instant coffee powder", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/8 teaspoon baking powder", "1/8 teaspoon baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)", "1/4 cup/20 grams cocoa powder, plus 3 teaspoons extra for dusting", "2 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks (reserve the 2 whites for the meringue topping)", "1/3 packed cup/100 grams dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon fresh orange zest", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar (icing sugar), for dusting the cake", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar (caster sugar)", "7 ounces/200 grams medjool dates, pitted and finely chopped", "2 teaspoons orange zest plus 2 tablespoons juice (from 1 orange)", "1 1/2 tablespoons Cognac", "3/4 teaspoon ground star anise", "1 cup/250 milliliters heavy whipping cream (double cream)", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/85 grams mascarpone", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar (caster sugar)", "2 large egg whites (reserved from the sponge cake ingredients)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the marmalade: Trim and discard the ends of the kumquats, slice the kumquats into 1/8-inch/1/4-centimeter rounds and discard the seeds (pips).
