{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Frankies Spuntino Pork Braciole", "description": "Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, who own the Frankies Spuntino restaurants in New York, prefer to keep it mellow. \"I cooked on the line for 18 years,\" Mr. Falcinelli told The Times. Mr. Castronovo, equally low-key, said, \"We like to take the easy approach.\" That means many of their dishes, like vegetable antipasti, grilled meats and wine-stewed prunes, are cooked well ahead and assembled to order or served at room temperature. In this version of braciola, the meat rolls are covered with canned tomatoes that become sauce as the meat cooks. \"My grandfather calls it gravy,\" Mr. Falcinelli said. \"For the Sunday sauce, you do spareribs, sausage, meatballs, braciola.\" The Franks\u2019 version is lighter, meant to be eaten with salad and bread, not steaming pasta. Leftovers are good for sandwiches the following day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dana Bowen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/29/dining/Pork-Braciola/Pork-Braciola-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "fall, garlic, pork, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 115}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 825, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "58 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "60 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "1393 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds pork braciola cutlets (sliced from the shoulder and pounded into six 6-by-8-inch pieces about 1/4 inch thick)", "Salt and white pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons minced garlic, plus 8 to 10 large whole cloves", "2/3 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (more for serving)", "1 cup grated aged provolone", "2 28-ounce cans whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, plus an extra can in case more sauce is needed", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1/4 cup grape seed oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
