{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "B\u00e9arnaise Sauce", "description": "A classic sauce for steaks and fish, a good b\u00e9arnaise should have a pronounced piquancy from the tarragon, vinegar and shallots, along with plenty of creamy richness from butter and egg yolks. The key here to forming a stable emulsion is temperature. Make sure to follow the directions for when to add the cold butter versus the melted butter. You want the mixture to stay warm without  overheating, which could make it curdle. It's not difficult, but it does require your undivided attention.
