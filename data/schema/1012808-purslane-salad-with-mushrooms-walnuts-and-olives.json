{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Purslane Salad With Mushrooms, Walnuts and Olives", "description": "One of the things I like best about these greens is that they\u2019re good cooked or uncooked. The leaves of dandelions and amaranth are quite tough, so if they are to be used in a salad, they should be cut in very thin ribbons, or chiffonade. Cooking diminishes their bitterness and gives endives a velvety texture that I love. This crunchy salad is about as high in omega-3 fats as a salad can be.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/10/05/health/05recipehealth_600/05recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "Serves six", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low-carb, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, vegetarian, mushroom, purslane", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 139, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "178 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 generous bunch purslane, thick stems cut away (about 4 cups), washed and dried", "6 medium-size cremini or white mushrooms, wiped clean, trimmed and sliced", "1/3 cup thinly sliced celery (from the heart of the celery)", "1 tablespoon minced celery leaves", "1/4 cup broken walnuts", "12 kalamata olives, pitted and halved (optional)", "1/4 cup crumbled feta (1 ounce)", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, white wine vinegar, or sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 garlic clove, green shoot removed, minced or pureed", "Salt to taste", "1/3 cup olive oil", "freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the purslane, mushrooms, celery, celery leaves, walnuts, olives and feta in a large salad bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together the vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, salt, olive oil and pepper.
