I loved the addition of the spicy roasted cauliflower to each bowl of soup, along with the tortilla crisps that I toasted in the microwave rather than frying. You can make this soup even more substantial by adding eggs (see the variation that follows the recipe).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/10/science/recipehealthtortilla/recipehealthtortilla-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 299}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 160, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "907 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small head cauliflower", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt to taste", "1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder or medium-hot chili powder", "1/2 medium onion, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon mild or medium-hot chili powder", "2 plump garlic cloves, minced", "1 (14-ounce) can chopped tomatoes", "1 1/2 quarts chicken stock, vegetable stock or garlic broth", "6 corn tortillas, cut in strips", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice", "1/4 cup crumbled queso fresco or feta", "Lime wedges for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
