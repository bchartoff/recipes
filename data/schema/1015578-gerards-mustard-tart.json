Dorie's friend G\u00e9rard Jeannin uses Dijon\u2019s two most popular mustards in his tart: smooth, known around the world as Dijon, and grainy or old-fashioned, known in France as \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019ancienne.\u201d You can use either one or the other, or you can adjust the proportions to match your taste, but whatever you do, make sure your mustard is fresh, bright colored, and powerfully fragrant. Do what G\u00e9rard would do: smell it first. If it just about brings tears to your eyes, it\u2019s fresh enough for this tart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Weinstein"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, mustard", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 200, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "411 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 carrots (not too fat), trimmed and peeled", "3 thin leeks, white and light green parts only, cut lengthwise in half and washed", "2 rosemary sprigs", "3 large eggs", "6 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or heavy cream", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or to taste", "2 tablespoons grainy mustard, preferably French, or to taste", "Salt, preferably fleur de sel, and freshly ground white pepper", "1 9- to 9\u00bd-inch tart shell made from Tart Dough, partially baked and cooled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
