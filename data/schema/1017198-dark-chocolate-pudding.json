{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dark Chocolate Pudding", "description": "This rich, creamy confection crosses a classic, American, cornstarch-thickened chocolate pudding with a luxurious French egg-yolk-laden chocolate custard called pot de cr\u00e8me. It has a dense, satiny texture and a fudgelike flavor from the combination of bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder and brown sugar. Make sure to serve it with either whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche for a cool contrast; cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche has the advantage of also adding tang.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/03/multimedia/clark-choc-pudding/clark-choc-pudding-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H20M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, custards and puddings", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder, heavy cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 820}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 230, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "152 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large egg, plus 2 yolks", "6 ounces/170 grams bittersweet chocolate, preferably 66 percent to 74 percent cacao, chopped", "2 tablespoons/30 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "2 1/2 cups/590 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream", "1/3 cup/67 grams light or dark brown sugar", "2 tablespoons/15 grams unsweetened cocoa powder", "2 tablespoons/20 grams cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon/2 grams fine sea salt", "Whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving", "Chocolate shavings, for garnish (optional)", "Flaky sea salt, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small heatproof bowl, whisk together egg and yolks.
