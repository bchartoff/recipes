Naughty, naughty mint!\u2019\u2019) but explains why it\u2019s important: \u2018\u2018The small capillaries visible in mint leaves contain all the essential oils that create that unmistakable mintiness. There\u2019s no need to muddle the mint, as that causes near-instantaneous oxidation, which turns mint bitter. A light slapping of mint leaves against the back of your hand opens up those capillaries and releases all the aroma that one could hope for with a minimum of effort.\u2019\u2019", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/10/magazine/10drink3/10drink3-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 50, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "5 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Small bunch of mint", "2 ounces Lillet Ros\u00e9", "1/2 ounce green Chartreuse"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rub 2 or 3 mint leaves inside a julep cup (you can also use an old-fashioned glass)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add Lillet Ros\u00e9 and Chartreuse, fill halfway with crushed ice and swizzle or stir.
