It will cook down as you stir and simmer the rice. Get into the habit of cooking and freezing grains ahead so you can make multigrain risottos like this without having to take the extra step of cooking the quinoa \u2014 though it only takes 15 to 20 minutes to cook this grain. Note that you might not use all of the stock; I just don\u2019t like coming up short. Freeze what you don\u2019t use.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/10/science/09recipehealth/09recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, winter, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, low sugar, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 145}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 478, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1140 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 generous bunch black or curly kale (about 3/4 pound)", "6 to 7 cups well seasoned chicken stock or vegetable stock", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup minced onion", "Salt to taste", "2/3 cup Arborio rice", "1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste), minced", "1/2 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc", "3 cups cooked black quinoa", "1/2 cup chopped walnuts", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (2 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stem the kale and wash in 2 rinses of water.
