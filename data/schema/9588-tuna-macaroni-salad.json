{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tuna-Macaroni Salad", "description": "If there is such a thing as comfort salad, then this is it: A cold and creamy, mayonnaise-laden pasta that evokes your grandma's \u201ctuna mac,\u201d but made a touch more sophisticated with the addition of cornichons and scallions. Amanda Hesser picked up the recipe, in 2006, from Clementine, a bakery and cafe in Los Angeles known for \u201cits stylish take on home-style cooking.\u201d They were selling it for about 9 bucks a quart, but you can make it at home for about a quarter of that. Thankfully, it's no more difficult to make than Grandma's. Just boil up some macaroni and drain. Combine with two cans of tuna (if you're feeling flush, you can add chunks of cooked fresh tuna like we did for the photo) one cup of mayonnaise, chopped celery, cubed Cheddar cheese, sliced scallions and cornichons and two spoonfuls of chowchow, a green tomato relish that's an optional addition. Season well with freshly ground black pepper and serve cold.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/22/dining/22COOKING-TUNAMACARONISALAD1/22COOKING-TUNAMACARONISALAD1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, pastas, salads and dressings", "keywords": "cornichons, macaroni, tuna, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 432}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 541, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "553 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1/2 pound uncooked elbow macaroni", "1/2 cup 1/4 -inch diced celery", "2 ounces sharp Cheddar, cut into 1/4 -inch cubes", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions", "1/4 cup sliced cornichon rounds", "2 tablespoons mild Tennessee chow chow (optional)", "1 cup mayonnaise", "2 6-ounce cans chunk light tuna in water, drained", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
