{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caponata", "description": "Caponata is a Sicilian sweet and sour version of ratatouille. Because eggplant absorbs flavors like a sponge, it\u2019s particularly good in such a pungent dish. Like most eggplant dishes, this gets better overnight. It\u2019s meant to be served at room temperature, and I like it cold as well. It makes a great topping for bruschetta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/09/04/health/nutrition/04recipe.health.ready/04recipe.health.ready-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 340}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 100, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "502 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds eggplant (1 large), roasted", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "2 stalks celery, from the inner, tender stalks (the heart), diced", "3 large garlic cloves, minced", "2 red bell peppers, diced", "Salt to taste", "1 pound ripe tomatoes, preferably romas, peeled, seeded and finely chopped, or 1 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes (in puree)", "3 heaped tablespoons capers, rinsed and drained", "3 tablespoons coarsely chopped pitted green olives", "2 tablespoons plus a pinch of sugar", "3 tablespoons red or white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar (more to taste)", "freshly ground pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Roast the eggplant, allow to cool and chop coarsely."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat in a large, heavy nonstick skillet and add the onion and celery.
