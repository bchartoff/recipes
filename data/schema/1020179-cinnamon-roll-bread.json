{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cinnamon Roll Bread", "description": "This stunning bread is made from 16 small cinnamon rolls that are arranged in a loaf pan, creating a swirled pattern that\u2019s surprisingly easy to achieve. The bread is delicious served slightly warm, but if you want to see precise spirals in your slice, let it cool completely before slicing. The icing is meant to be quite thick; if you apply it while the loaf is still warm, it will remain soft and gooey. If you apply it once the bread is fully cooled, it will harden to a thick, glossy frosting. Both are equally delicious, and which one you choose may depend entirely on how patient you can be once the aroma permeates your kitchen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/15/dining/em-cinnamon-roll-bread/merlin_153444012_bb5224dc-cced-491b-ae17-9c06436b1a04-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, breads", "keywords": "butter, cinnamon, instant yeast, milk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 233}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons instant yeast", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick), at room temperature", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "8 tablespoons/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "2/3 cup/145 grams light brown sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large egg", "1 cup/125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3 tablespoons heavy cream, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grease a 9-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with a parchment paper sling, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the long sides."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour the milk into a small pot and heat over low until it\u2019s just warm to the touch (about 95 degrees).
