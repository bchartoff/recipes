This is a fine idea, but almost as easy is mixing up a batch of mincemeat (minus the meat) at home. The cook can control the balance of sugar, citrus and spice and also use up all the half-empty containers of dried fruit that seem to end up lurking in kitchen cabinets. This \u201crecipe\u201d is entirely flexible; feel free to add orange zest, walnuts, apricots or whatever you like. The sauce will be equally good on pumpkin or sweet potato pie, ice cream or baked apples.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/18/dining/18JULIAREX4/18JULIAREX4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1D", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "apple, brandy, golden raisins, prune, walnut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 444, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "17 milligrams", "sugarContent": "56 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tart apple, peeled and cored", "4 ounces golden raisins", "3 ounces dark brown sugar", "2 ounces prunes or dried figs, coarsely chopped", "2 ounces walnut or pecan halves", "1 ounces dried cherries", "1 ounce cold butter, cut into pieces", "1/2 ounce crystallized ginger, coarsely chopped", "1/4 cup brandy, like Cognac or Calvados", "1 lemon, zested and juiced", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground clove", "Dark rum, apple cider or orange juice", "Black pepper to taste", "1 to 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all ingredients except those to finish the sauce in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped; do not pur\u00e9e.\u00a0Transfer to an airtight container and let rest at least 1 day, or up to 4 weeks."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When ready to serve, transfer to a saucepan and add enough rum or other liquid to loosen.\u00a0Heat until warm and bubbly.\u00a0If desired, add black pepper to make the mixture more spicy.
