{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skirt Steak With Lentil Salad", "description": "This recipe came to The Times in 1990 in Pierre Franey's 60-Minute Gourmet column. A lentil salad (we used those tiny French green lentils, but you can use the standard supermarket variety as well) is dressed with a Dijon mustard vinaigrette, then topped with skirt steak that's been seared in a cast-iron pan. A simple sauce, made by deglazing the pan with butter, garlic and parsley, is drizzled over the top. It is classic Franey \u2013 uncomplicated, elegant and delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/17/dining/17COOKINGRECIPE-STEAK1/17COOKINGRECIPE-STEAK1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops", "keywords": "beef, lentils, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 195}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 cups water", "1 pound dried lentils", "1 cup finely diced carrots", "1 bay leaf", "3 sprigs fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard", "3/4 cup vegetable oil", "1/4 cup red-wine vinegar", "1 cup finely chopped onions", "4 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon or parsley", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "4 skirt steaks, about 1/2 pound each, trimmed of excess fat", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic", "2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the lentil salad, put the water in a large saucepan.
