{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesecake Pudding", "description": "This easy stovetop pudding is smooth, rich and tangy, just like your favorite cheesecake \u2014 but it\u2019s far faster (under an hour), far easier (no fussy water baths) and far less intimidating (the topping won\u2019t crack). It\u2019s considered a boiled custard, meaning the ingredients are heated slowly until the mixture forms large bubbles in the pot. Whisking the cornstarch and sugar together before adding them to the custard is a crucial step that helps the sugar granules break up the starch, which prevents lumps. This silky pudding is delicious served alone, enjoyed with just a spoon, but you can also gussy it up with fresh berries and crumbled graham crackers for a more cheesecake-like experience.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/25/dining/em-cheesecake-pudding/em-cheesecake-pudding-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "cream cheese, eggs, heavy cream, milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 210}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 342, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "267 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/3 cups/560 milliliters whole milk", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters heavy cream", "Zest of 1 lemon (about 1 tablespoon)", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams cornstarch", "4 large egg yolks", "12 ounces/340 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "Crumbled graham crackers or shortbread cookies, for serving (optional)", "Fresh berries, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, whisk the milk, heavy cream, lemon zest, salt and 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar until combined.
