{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Socca (Farinata)", "description": "This is essentially a large chickpea pancake from Provence (and neighboring Liguria, where it\u2019s called farinata). It\u2019s traditionally cooked in wood ovens on copper disks, roughly cut and served hot or warm. (In the main market in Nice, it\u2019s baked a few hundred yards away and delivered by bicycle, to be wrapped in paper and eaten on the street.) If you have no wood or copper, that\u2019s no problem. They\u2019re nearly as great in a skillet or in a pizza pan in your oven, and totally foolproof.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/21/dining/21COOKING_SOCCAFARINATA2/21COOKING_SOCCAFARINATA2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "provencal", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "appetizer, chickpea flour, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 375}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 165, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "92 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup chickpea flour", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "4 to 6 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 large onion, thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450.
