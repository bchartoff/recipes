{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Meatballs With Spiced Tomato Sauce", "description": "Here is a recipe from the Los Angeles chef Suzanne Goin that plays to children as well as to the most sophisticated of palates. It is for crisp lamb meatballs cooked through in a fragrant, vaguely North African sauce of tomato sauce zipped up with orange juice and warm spices, then topped with feta and mint. Ms. Goin first served the dish at one of her Los Angeles restaurants, and put it into \u2018\u2018The A.O.C. Cookbook\u2019\u2019 (2013), devoted to that restaurant\u2019s food. A version of the dish was later introduced to the menu of her children\u2019s school. It can be cooked in an hour\u2019s time, not all of it busy, and served with pita or plain pasta, bulgur or couscous.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/20/magazine/20eat1/mag-20Eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "appetizer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 765}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium onion, peeled and finely diced", "\u00bc cup heavy cream", "2 egg yolks, extra-large", "\u00bd teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "Pinch red-pepper flakes", "Pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste", "2 pounds ground lamb", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup bread crumbs", "\u00bc cup chopped parsley", "1 28-ounce can whole tomatoes", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small sprig rosemary", "Red-pepper flakes to taste", "1 medium onion, peeled and diced", "\u00bd teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "\u00bd teaspoon ground cumin", "Pinch ground cinnamon", "Pinch cayenne pepper", "1 bay leaf", "\u00bd teaspoon white sugar", "\u00bc cup orange juice", "1 3-inch strip of orange peel, \n pith removed", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black \npepper to taste", "4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced mint leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat broiler.
