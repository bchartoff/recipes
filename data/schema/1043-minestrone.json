{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Minestrone", "description": "One of my favorite dishes, which is hard to find properly made in Italian restaurants, is a good minestrone. This hardy vegetable soup is especially delicious poured on top of a mound of steamed Swiss chard or kale, and garnished with a green extra virgin Tuscan olive oil and freshly grated Parmesan. If you have any leftover rinds of Parmesan cheese, they can be cooked in the soup and will give it flavor. Serve the soup with toasted Italian bread spread with olive oil and rubbed with crushed garlic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Moira Hodgson"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "6 - 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "cannellini beans, tomato, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 90}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 360, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1126 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups dried cannellini beans", "1 medium onion, coarsely chopped", "1 clove garlic, minced", "2 leeks, sliced", "4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 stalks celery, sliced", "1/2 pound baby carrots, cut in half", "1/2 pound small zucchini, cut in 1-inch pieces", "1/2 pound string beans, cut in 1-inch pieces", "1 large potato, peeled and diced", "1 cup Italian tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped (fresh or canned)", "8 cups chicken stock", "Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "4 tablespoons Italian parsley, chopped", "Freshly grated Parmesan cheese to garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the beans overnight in water to cover.
