{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheese Pumpkin Soup With Sage and Apple", "description": "For cooking, forget the giant pumpkins that are meant for life as jack o\u2019lanterns. The flat, lesser known heirloom variety called the Long Island cheese pumpkin is the prizewinner. This sweet, beige pumpkin gets its name from its resemblance to a wheel of cheese. Making pumpkin soup is a go-to way to prepare the fruit. As with any soup, the key is the quality of stock used. It should add flavor, but not too much or it will eclipse the taste of the pumpkin. Vegetable stock is the best choice here. Roasting the pumpkin with the seeds intact (except for a handful to be used as garnish) intensifies the flavor and adds a slight nuttiness to the soup. Adding sage and some raw apple brings aroma and acidity to the recipe. Finish with pumpkin oil for added richness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Schwarz And Greg Kessler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/07/dining/recipe-cheese-pumpkin-soup/recipe-cheese-pumpkin-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4-6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "apple, carrot, pumpkin, sage, stock, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 105}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 482, "unsaturatedFatContent": "34 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1432 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cheese pumpkin, cut in half from stem to bottom", "2 carrots, peeled", "1 medium onion", "6 cups vegetable stock", "12 sage leaves", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 apples, peeled and halved, cores removed, chopped", "Salt and pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove about 1 cup of seeds from the pumpkin halves.
