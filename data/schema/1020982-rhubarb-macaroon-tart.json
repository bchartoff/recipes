{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb Macaroon Tart", "description": "Rhubarb makes any dessert a showstopper, but this tart has more than meets the eye. Under the fruit is a luscious vanilla custard nestled in a chewy macaroon shell. When shopping, look for rhubarb that is about 1/2- to 3/4-inch wide; any bigger and the stalks might start to fall apart in the poaching liquid before the center becomes tender, and any smaller and you\u2019ll need to keep a close eye, since they\u2019ll cook quickly. While the rhubarb topping is a show-stopper, freshly sliced fruit makes a great understudy if you can\u2019t find robust pink stalks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/dining/ss-rhubarb-macaroon-tart/merlin_171207468_6ed01d71-265c-45ea-863f-900653819f12-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, heavy cream, rhubarb, shredded coconut, vanilla", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce/400 gram) bag sweetened, shredded coconut (about 5 cups)", "Butter, for greasing", "4 large egg whites", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 3/4 cups/420 milliliters whole milk", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy cream", "4 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 vanilla bean, split and scraped (or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract)", "1/2 teaspoon rose water (optional)", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 vanilla bean, split and scraped\u00a0(or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract)", "1 3/4 pounds/800 grams medium rhubarb stalks, cut into 4-inch batons"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
