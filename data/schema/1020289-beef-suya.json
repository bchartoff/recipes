{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef Suya", "description": "Suya is a popular Nigerian street food made of thin strips of meat that are seasoned, skewered and grilled. The term \u201csuya\u201d can refer to the preparation technique or the resulting dish, and can apply to other meats, such as goat and chicken. This recipe is similar in style to the suya made from a fattier cut of beef called tozo, which comes from the hump of the zebu cattle, found in northern Nigeria. A well-marbled piece of boneless short rib is a great substitute. Ask your butcher to thinly slice the meat into strips, or pop it into your freezer for 30 minutes and use a sharp knife to slice. Suya spice, or yaji, is available online or at African groceries, or you can make your own (see Tip).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/24Nigerianrex3/merlin_156460098_adba29d1-120c-498c-b605-3d26da31afda-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings (Makes 12 skewers)", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, barbecues, finger foods, meat, skewers and kebabs", "keywords": "main course, peanuts, short ribs, suya spice blend", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 82}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless short ribs, sliced lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick strips", "1/4 cup peanut oil, plus more for grilling", "2 tablespoons store-bought or homemade ground suya spice blend (see Note), plus more for serving", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, grated", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "Kosher salt", "2 medium plum tomatoes, sliced into 1/4-inch strips, seeds discarded", "1 small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced into rings", "1 lime (optional)", "1/4 cup toasted peanuts, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay several strips of meat on a piece of plastic wrap, leaving about 1/2 inch between each slice, and top with another piece of plastic wrap.
