{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry Crumb Cake", "description": "With their pleasant tang and gorgeous color, cranberries take this brunch staple to the next level. Here, they're nestled in a sour cream cake batter that's topped with a butter crumb, and cook down to add the perfect burst of sour. You can use fresh cranberries or berries that have been frozen and thawed, but note that the cooking time will vary depending on which you use. Lastly, while cranberries make this cake especially nice for fall and winter, blueberries, raspberries or blackberries would be excellent in the summer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/07/dining/ss-cranberry-crumb-cake/merlin_163577526_ced088cf-cc04-4efe-b9f6-31d56c93e2fc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "24 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cinnamon, cranberry, orange, sour cream, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 318}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon freshly grated orange zest (from 1 or 2 oranges)", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1 cup/240 milliliters full-fat sour cream, at room temperature", "3 cups/340 grams fresh or unthawed frozen cranberries", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup packed/220 grams light or dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
