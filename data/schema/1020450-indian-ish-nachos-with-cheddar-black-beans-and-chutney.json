{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Indian-ish Nachos With Cheddar, Black Beans and Chutney", "description": "These vegetarian nachos take their cues from paapdi or papri chaat, the spicy, tangy and sweet Indian snack of fried dough wafers piled with chickpeas, tomatoes, onions, yogurt and various chutneys. This take starts with standard nacho elements: tortilla chips, black beans and a healthy amount of bubbly, melted cheese. But the classic chaat pairing of spicy and verdant cilantro chutney with sweet and sour tamarind sauce provides another level of brightness and complexity. Don\u2019t skip the chhonk, a sauce made of melted ghee, cumin seeds and red chile powder that is drizzled over the top of the nachos. It provides a rich finish and even more crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna and Ritu Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/dining/pk-indian-nachos/pk-indian-nachos-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, burritos and nachos", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, black beans, cheddar, ghee, tamarind sauce, tortilla chips, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 559}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large bunch fresh cilantro, leaves and tender stems roughly chopped (about 4 cups)", "1 small Indian green chile or serrano chile, stem removed and roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from about 1 lime), plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained", "Kosher salt", "1 (8-ounce) bag white corn tortilla chips, preferably unsalted", "1 medium red onion, finely chopped", "2 medium Roma tomatoes, cored and finely chopped", "4 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese (about 1 pound)", "1/4 cup store-bought tamarind sauce (or\u00a01/4 cup date syrup or maple syrup whisked with 1 tablespoon lime juice)", "1/4 cup ghee or olive oil", "2 tablespoons cumin seeds", "Pinch of red chile powder, such as ground cayenne", "Greek yogurt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
