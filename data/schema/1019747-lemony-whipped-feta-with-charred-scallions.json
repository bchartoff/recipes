{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemony Whipped Feta With Charred Scallions", "description": "A spin in the food processor and a little olive oil and cream cheese take feta from crumbly and coarse to airy and spreadable. Whipped feta is wonderful on its own, but for a smoky sweetness that makes it special, flavor the dip with scallions that have been blackened in the oven. Serve with pita chips or buttery crackers, and if you\u2019re an overachiever, top the dip with charred cherry tomatoes and a drizzle of honey.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jampel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/13/dining/sj-lemon-feta-dip/sj-lemon-feta-dip-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 6 to 8 servings (About 2 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, cream cheese, feta, lemon, scallion, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1436}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 317, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "527 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 lemons, plus more to taste", "1 bunch scallions, trimmed and halved crosswise", "1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil", "10 ounces feta cheese,\u00a0broken into large pieces (about 2 1/2 to 3 cups)", "4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature, or heavy cream", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for garnish", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne, plus more for garnish", "1 tablespoon hot water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler and line a sheet pan with foil.
