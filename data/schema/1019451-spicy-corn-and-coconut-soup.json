{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Corn and Coconut Soup", "description": "A good corn soup is creamy and naturally sweet; an even better corn soup is spicy, refreshing and addictive. In this recipe, it\u2019s the combination of shallots, garlic, ginger, chiles and coconut milk, rather than heavy cream or butter, that makes the soup at once cooling and rich. It\u2019s a dinner in a bowl (and a vegan one at that), but it would surely welcome a side of steamed rice or salad of leafy greens. To serve, add garnishes that are any combination of spicy (extra fresh chile or store-bought chile oil), crunchy (toasted coconut, chopped peanuts or cashews, fried shallots) or fresh (torn cilantro, chopped scallions), and it\u2019ll be even more dynamic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jampel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/dining/corn-soup/corn-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, soups and stews", "keywords": "coconut milk, corn, ginger, red potato, fall, summer, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1399}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 482, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "1231 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ears yellow or bicolor corn (or 5 cups frozen corn kernels)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 shallots, thinly sliced into rings", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and minced", "1 serrano chile (or other chile), minced", "2 small red potatoes (6 to 8 ounces total), cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 1/2 cups vegetable broth (or 2 1/2 cups of hot water whisked with 1 1/2 teaspoons jarred bouillon)", "1 (15-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "1 tablespoon lime juice (from 1/2 lime)", "Kosher salt, to season", "Torn cilantro leaves, toasted coconut flakes, chopped roasted peanuts, crispy fried shallots, lime wedges and more sliced Serrano chiles, to serve (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the corn kernels off the cobs and transfer to a bowl.
