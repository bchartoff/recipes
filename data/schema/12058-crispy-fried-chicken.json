Take the chicken pieces out of the buttermilk, and shake them in the bag with the seasoned flour, one or two at a time. Drop them in the hot oil deep enough to cover, and fry for 6 to 8 minutes. Turn and continue cooking. Turn once more, and cook until the chicken is well browned and tender to the fork. Transfer the chicken to absorbent paper. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary. If serving the chicken later, allow it to cool completely before packing so that it stays crisp."}]}
