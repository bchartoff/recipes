Strip most of the surface fat from the lamb. (Your butcher may already have done this.) Cut between the ribs, almost down to the meaty eye. Divide each rack in half down the middle, sprinkle with salt and pepper and place in a roasting pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Roast for 15 minutes, then insert a meat thermometer straight in from one end into the meatiest part. If it reads 125 degrees or more, remove the lamb immediately. If it reads 120 degrees or less, put the lamb back for about 5 minutes, no more. Remove and let sit for 5 minutes; this will give you medium- to medium-rare lamb on the outer ribs, medium rare-to-rare in the center. Cook a little longer for more doneness. Serve, separating the ribs, if desired, by cutting down straight through them."}]}
