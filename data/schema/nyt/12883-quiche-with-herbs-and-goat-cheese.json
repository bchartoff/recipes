{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quiche With Herbs and Goat Cheese", "description": "This green quiche laden with herbs and with thin slices of fresh goat cheese baked on top has a Gallic rusticity. A proper quiche (also known as a tarte sal\u00e9e, or savory open pie) should have really good pastry and contain a soft, tender eggy custard. It should be light enough to serve as a first course, or in larger portions for a simple main course. It should be something to sing about.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/24/dining/24KITCH_SPAN/24KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner", "keywords": "eggs, goat cheese, main course, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 527}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 257, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "377 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Short-crust dough (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12884-basic-short-crust-pastry\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>), rolled and chilled in a 9 1/2-inch tart pan", "3 large eggs", "1 and 1/4 cups half-and-half", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Black pepper, to taste", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme", "2 tablespoons chopped scallions", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley", "4 ounces fresh goat cheese, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake prepared dough at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned.
