{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Pot Roast", "description": "This is a classic, comforting pot roast, rich with red wine and onions. A pressure cooker works wonders on tough cuts of meat like the chuck roast called for here; the roast is braised to tenderness in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven. The trick to this perfectly cooked meal is timing: Pop the vegetables into the pressure cooker just for the last few minutes of cooking, so they are tender but not overly softened. The optional quick-pickled onions give the mellow beef and sweet vegetables an appealing tangy pop. If you\u2019re short on time, you don\u2019t need to thicken the cooking liquid to make a gravy; just drizzle some pan juice over the top and call it a day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/30/dining/sdg-pressure-cooker-pot-roast/merlin_168064572_dc3d6856-89e3-4cf0-bcdc-4db36e030eba-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, roasts", "keywords": "beef, garlic, herbs, onion, red wine, root vegetables, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 186}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds beef chuck roast, cut in half", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "7 ounces frozen pearl onions (or 1 yellow or red onion, peeled and cut into wedges)", "8 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 1/2 cups dry red wine", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "5 fresh woody herb sprigs, such as a mix of thyme, sage and rosemary (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme, rosemary or sage)", "1 to 1\u00bd pounds root vegetables, such as a mix of peeled carrots and parsnips, cut into 2-inch chunks", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature (optional)", "2 tablespoons flour (optional)", "1 cup red wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "7 ounces frozen pearl onions (or 1 yellow or red onion, peeled and thinly sliced)", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the beef generously all over with about 1 tablespoon salt.

Break the beef into large chunks to serve. At this point, you can simply drizzle some cooking liquid over the top of the beef and vegetables, and top with the drained, pickled pearl onions to serve.

Once the liquid is boiling, drop the butter-flour mixture into the pot, whisking well to combine. Let it bubble until it is lightly thickened, about 5 minutes, then drizzle some gravy over the pot roast and vegetables, and top with drained, pickled onions. Serve extra gravy on the side."}]}
