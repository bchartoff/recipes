New wave? The guy serves smoked carrots and burdock root \u201cmeat sticks\u201d alongside house-cured pancetta, pastrami and bresaola. His passion for \u2014 and obsession with \u2014 koji, the miracle spore used by the Japanese to turn soybeans into soy sauce and miso, runs so deep, he not only gave a TED Talk on the topic, he wrote a whole book about it, \u201cKoji Alchemy\u201d (Chelsea Green Publishing, 2020). Most of his vegetable charcuterie involves a complex curing, smoking and aging process, plus fermentation with koji, but these carrots can be smoked from start to finish in about an hour. The roasted yeast rub gives them an otherworldly flavor that\u2019s smoky, malty and absolutely unique.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/26/dining/24charcuterierex2/merlin_175804941_79d57951-2b55-4575-b01a-5cbbc6b4f987-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "carrot, cocoa powder, granulated baker's yeast, maple syrup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "recipeIngredient": ["Hardwood chunks or chips (Mr. Umansky uses shagbark hickory), for smoking (if using chips, soak them in water to cover for 30 minutes then drain)", "2 pounds medium carrots, preferably organic or from your local farmers\u2019 market", "1/4 cup active dry yeast", "2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon caraway seeds", "5 juniper berries, lightly crushed with the side of a cleaver", "3 tablespoons maple syrup (or to taste)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil", "Sea salt", "1/4 cup chopped celery leaves for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set up your smoker following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and heat to 250 degrees.
