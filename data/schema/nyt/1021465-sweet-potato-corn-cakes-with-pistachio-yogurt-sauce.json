{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato-Corn Cakes With Pistachio-Yogurt Sauce", "description": "Sweet potato and sweet corn are combined with curry leaves and spices in these savory cakes, meant to be served alongside a creamy pistachio-yogurt sauce. For best results, you\u2019ll want to get as much liquid out of the ingredients: Salting the sweet potatoes helps, as does using fresh eggs. (If your eggs are a bit old, place them in a fine-mesh sieve over a small bowl to drain the watery part.) And don\u2019t skip blanching pistachios to get rid of their skins, or they\u2019ll retain their bitterness. These cakes are best eaten straight off the pan, paired with plain rice, or tucked into sandwiches drizzled with the pistachio-yogurt sauce, but leftovers can be reheated in the oven.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/dining/nk-corn-cakes/nk-corn-cakes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "16 (3-inch) cakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "corn, sweet potato, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 84}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large sweet potatoes (about 2 pounds), peeled and grated", "Kosher salt", "1 cup fresh corn kernels (from 1 whole ear corn) or frozen kernels, thawed and drained", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "1 shallot, peeled and minced", "12 to 15 curry leaves, chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, such as Urfa or Maras", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 large eggs, lightly whisked", "Neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed, for frying", "1/2 cup shelled, unsalted pistachios", "1 cup plain Greek yogurt", "2 scallions, ends trimmed and discarded", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup", "1 garlic clove, peeled", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cakes: In a large bowl, toss the grated\u00a0sweet potatoes with 1 teaspoon salt.
