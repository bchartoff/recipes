{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broccoli-Dill Pasta", "description": "Bryant Terry, an Oakland, Calif., chef with two young daughters, developed this recipe to make eating broccoli a treat. It worked: Blanched and pur\u00e9ed with lemon, garlic and a little of what he calls \u201cumami powder,\u201d the broccoli transforms into a deeply flavorful vegan spread that\u2019s also highly adaptable. Thin it with pasta water and toss it with hot noodles, as seen here, or scrape it into a bowl as a dip for crudit\u00e9s. Spread it onto a thick piece of toast and cover it with sliced radishes, dill and crunchy salt. Use some to drown a softly poached egg, drizzle with olive oil, and eat with a spoon, or to dress warm white beans, then shower them with black pepper and grated cheese. Whatever you do, don\u2019t skip rinsing the broccoli with cold water after you blanch it; the step keeps the spread a vibrant green.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/magazine/05mag-eat/05mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings, plus extra umami powder", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, pastas, sauces and gravies, vegetables", "keywords": "broccoli, cashew, dill, lemon, pasta, porcini, spaghetti, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, roughly chopped", "3/4 cup whole raw cashews", "3 tablespoons nutritional yeast", "2 tablespoons raw pine nuts", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 medium head broccoli, cut into florets, thick stem reserved for another use", "8 ounces dried pasta, such as spaghetti", "1/2 cup loosely packed roughly chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish", "1 large garlic clove, minced", "1/3 cup umami powder", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Fresh lemon juice, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the umami powder: Grind the porcini in a spice grinder until pulverized, then transfer to a food processor.
