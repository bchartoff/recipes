Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy nonstick frying pan and add ground cumin and chili.  Cook, stirring over medium heat, for about a minute, until the spices begin to sizzle and cook. Add beans and cook at a brisk simmer, stirring and mashing with the back of your spoon, a potato masher or a wooden pestle, until they thicken and begin to get crusty on the bottom. Stir up the crust each time it forms, and mix it into the beans.  Cook until beans are thick but not dry, 10 to 15 minutes.  They will continue to thicken and dry out when you remove them from the heat. Add liquid you saved from the beans if they seem too dry, but save some of the liquid for moistening the beans if you are serving them later. Taste and adjust salt (they probably won\u2019t need any as the broth reduces when you refry them). \n"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut tortillas in half.
