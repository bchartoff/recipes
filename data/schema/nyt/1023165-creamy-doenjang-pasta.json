This version leans into the funkier, saltier flavor of doenjang, a Korean soybean paste whose pungency is an absolute pleasure in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022663-beans-and-greens-stew-with-doenjang\">jjigaes</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017445-spicy-sweet-korean-barbecue-sauce-ssamjang\">sauces</a> and even <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017377-boston-brown-bread\">bread made in a can</a>. Here, doenjang is tempered by the natural sweetness of milk, which stars in many Korean takes on Italian pasta. The milk thickens as it mixes with the starchy noodles and creates a velvety sauce, one that tastes rich but measured, with a rounded cheesy quality. It will seem like a lot of liquid at first, but the milk will reduce. The finished pasta sauce will continue to thicken once it\u2019s off the heat; add more pasta water if it starts to look dry.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/27/dining/EK-Creamy-Doenjang-Pasta/EK-Creamy-Doenjang-Pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "doenjang, mirin, pasta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 242}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1 pound linguine, bucatini or spaghetti", "2 cups whole milk", "1/4 cup doenjang (see Tip)", "2 tablespoons mirin", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup unsalted butter", "Grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large, wide pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high.
