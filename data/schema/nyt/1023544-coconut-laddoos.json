{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Laddoos", "description": "These round treats are a coconut lover\u2019s dream \u2014 and best of all, they\u2019re just three ingredients. Coconut laddoo is a type of mithai, or sweet, typically found in South Asian shops and served for celebratory occasions. While many types of mithai are milk- or nut-based, this one lets the coconut do all the talking, and a little bit of cardamom provides a floral edge. This particular variety is a crowd favorite at Jayasri Sweets in Herndon, Va., and the recipe comes from the shop\u2019s owner, Jayasri Gampa. This recipe works best with fresh coconut (frozen is fine); dried coconut doesn\u2019t have enough moisture for the mixture to hold together.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna and Cathy Lo"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/19/dining/17DIWALI-SHOPS-REX1/merlin_214343910_715cc877-a36c-4b5a-8ccf-1c1fd5862a6a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 16 laddoos", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "candies, dessert", "keywords": "cardamom, diwali, fresh coconut, make-ahead, south asian, dairy-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 129}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/480 grams lightly packed unsweetened grated frozen (thawed) coconut, or grated fresh coconut", "4 cups/804 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the coconut and sugar in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven and mix well.
