{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tang Yuan", "description": "This Chinese dessert is a favorite for Lunar New Year, or really, any time. Rice flour rounds filled with black sesame are simmered in sweet ginger soup until bobbing and shiny like pearls. When you scoop a dumpling with a spoonful of soup, then take a bite, you first taste the subtly sweet wrapper, which yields like nougat to the soft, toasty, nutty center. Be sure to refill the spoon with soup before the second bite, because you want the ginger\u2019s warmth to play sharp against the rich filling. Making tang yuan is as fun as eating them and nearly as easy. Soft and forgiving, the glutinous rice flour dough is simple to form and patch, no rolling pin needed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/03/dining/01Dumplingrex1/merlin_182770545_350adf92-2333-4616-bdb0-6f2e1e7b1825-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings (about 24 dumplings)", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, appetizer", "keywords": "black sesame seeds, ginger, lunar new year, peanut butter, rice flour, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 308}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (2-inch) piece/65 grams fresh ginger, scrubbed and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "3/4 cup/155 grams rock sugar or 1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/70 grams roasted black sesame seeds (see Tip)", "3 tablespoons/40 grams granulated sugar, plus more if desired", "3 tablespoons/50 grams creamy peanut butter or unsalted butter", "1 1/4 cups/175 grams glutinous rice flour, plus more as needed (see Notes)", "4 teaspoons grapeseed oil or other neutral oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the soup: Combine the ginger and sugar in a large saucepan with 6 cups water.
