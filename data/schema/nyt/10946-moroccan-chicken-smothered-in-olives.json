This dish, adapted from \"Mediterranean Cooking\" by Paula Wolfert, is almost as easy as a few pan-fried chicken breasts, but its flavors \u2013 ginger, turmeric, cumin, Spanish sweet paprika, briny olives \u2013 are far more exciting.

You're still going to fall in love with this dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alex Witchel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/08/dining/08COOKING-MOROCCAN-CHICKEN1/08COOKING-MOROCCAN-CHICKEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, olives, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 563}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 840, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "63 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1499 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup salt, for brining (optional)", "1/2 cup sugar, for brining (optional)", "8 chicken thighs with bone, skin removed and discarded", "2 onions, peeled, halved and sliced", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 tablespoon Spanish sweet paprika", "4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped", "3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "2 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "11 ounces pitted green olives in brine, like Goya's, drained", "Juice of 1 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To brine chicken (optional): In a large bowl, combine salt, sugar and 1 cup hot water.
