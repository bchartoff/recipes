{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Laurent Tourondel's Favorite Granola", "description": "This recipe came to The Times from the chef Laurent Tourondel. The focus is on texture: rolled oats, corn flakes, steel-cut oats and sliced almonds combine for a hefty crunch, while honey, vanilla, cinnamon and orange zest give it a golden warmth. The granola comes together quickly and will bake in 20 minutes or less. Store in an airtight container for a week, but you\u2019ll probably run out before then.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/05/dining/granola/granola-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, quick", "keywords": "main course, old-fashioned rolled oats, steel-cut oats, unsweetened corn flakes, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 253}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 531, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "85 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "405 milligrams", "sugarContent": "45 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats", "2 cups unsweetened cornflakes", "1 cup steel-cut oats", "1 cup sliced almonds", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 cup honey", "1/2 cup maple syrup", "1/4 cup canola oil", "Finely grated zest of 2 oranges", "2 vanilla beans, split and scraped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
