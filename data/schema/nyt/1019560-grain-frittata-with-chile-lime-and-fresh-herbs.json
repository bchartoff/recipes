For a frittata to look forward to, throw in leftover grains: The result is something like a Spanish tortilla, pleasingly dense, but with more bounce. Add an acid, like lime, and umami, like fish sauce, which melts into an underlying savoriness when warmed. Whatever you do, don\u2019t turn on the oven for this. Instead, stir the frittata on the stove and all but the top will set \u2014 nothing a few minutes covered can't fix (no precarious flip!). Finally, put a salad on top. The herby one here adds pep to the substantial frittata, as does a final squeeze of lime.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/13/dining/as-grain-frittata-horizontal/merlin_143375115_909efa8b-0b46-4d32-a320-4810b06613fe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, for two, lunch, quick, snack, weekday, weeknight, grains and rice", "keywords": "eggs, farro, fish sauce, herbs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 137}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 254, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "307 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 eggs", "1 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce", "1 cup cooked farro (or wheat berries, barley, spelt or rice)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 shallot, coarsely chopped (about 1/4 cup)", "1 Thai bird chile or 1/2 small jalape\u00f1o, thinly sliced (about 1/2 teaspoon)", "1/2 cup loosely packed dill, cilantro and-or mint leaves", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions", "1 lime, cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and 1/4 cup water until bubbles form, then whisk in the fish sauce until combined.
