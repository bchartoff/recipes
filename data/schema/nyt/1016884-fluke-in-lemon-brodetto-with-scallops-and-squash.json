Within two years I had made every recipe in it at least once, and by 2005 or so I was adapting the dishes to the ingredients I found at the market, instead of the other way around. Take the restaurant\u2019s black bass served in a lemony capon stock with Hubbard squash and delicate shell-on bay scallops from Taylor Shellfish Farms, in Washington State. There is no need to make the dish with black bass, Hubbard squash or Taylor bay scallops, much less capon broth. I use use fluke but any firm-fleshed white fish will do. Hubbard squash is a dream, but butternut squash works beautifully in its stead. As does chicken stock instead of the capon. And swapping out the farmed bay scallops for the deeper salinity of wild ones, or for small ocean scallops, is no crime. The most important thing is to locate thin-skinned lemons for the brodetto, since the thick ones impart a bitterness to the sauce that is not magical. If all you have is thick-skinned lemons, take a moment to cut out the white pith beneath the skin, which is the bitter culprit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/26/magazine/26eat2/mag-26eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "fluke, lemon, scallops, squash, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 61}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 544, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1151 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 thin-skinned lemons", "1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 heaping teaspoon fresh oregano leaves", "1 heaping teaspoon fresh marjoram leaves", "2 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade, or low-sodium", "1 cup dry white wine", "8 medium-size scallops", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small butternut squash, peeled and cubed, approximately 1/2 pound", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "2 teaspoons fresh marjoram leaves", "1/4 to 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, enough to flood your pan", "1 pound fluke, cut into four equal portions", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "1 tablespoon finely milled flour, like Wondra, or all-purpose flour", "2 scallions, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the <em>brodetto</em>, cut the lemons in half and then into quarters, deseeding them as you go.
