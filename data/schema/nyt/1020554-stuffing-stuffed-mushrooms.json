{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffing-Stuffed Mushrooms", "description": "In this recipe, classic stuffed mushrooms become an excellent vegetarian Thanksgiving appetizer or side dish by replacing Italian bread crumbs with cornbread, and using traditional stuffing flavors like rosemary, celery seeds and poultry seasoning. Two tips for making these extra flavorful: Trim the mushroom caps a bit to provide more surface area for caramelization, and pre-roast them to reduce moisture and prevent them from getting soggy. You can turn these into a main dish by using about eight large portobello mushrooms instead of two-bite cremini mushrooms, and increasing the cooking time accordingly. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have leftover Thanksgiving stuffing, you can use it in place of the cornbread mixture (you\u2019ll need about 4 cups); just add two beaten eggs and grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese to bind the mixture before piling it onto the mushrooms and roasting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/dining/aw-stuffing-stuffed-mushrooms/merlin_162489666_dabb8ac3-e47a-4f54-8788-351b7199f729-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "24 mushrooms (6 to 8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, finger foods, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, celery, cornbread, egg, gruy\u00e8re, mushroom, rosemary, shallot, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 109}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing pan", "24 large cremini mushrooms (about 1 1/4 pounds), each about 2 inches wide", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/4 teaspoon onion powder", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 small stalks celery, finely chopped (about 2/3 cup), plus 1 tablespoon minced celery leaves", "2 large shallots, minced", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary", "1 teaspoon poultry seasoning", "1 teaspoon celery seeds", "6 ounces cornbread, crumbled into small pieces (about 2 loose cups)", "1 to 1 1/2 cups grated Gruy\u00e8re or Emmental cheese", "4 tablespoons minced fresh parsley", "2 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and lightly brush a large rimmed sheet pan with olive oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using barely moist paper towels, wipe the mushroom stems and caps clean.
