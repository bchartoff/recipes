{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry Yogurt Parfait", "description": "The beneficial phytonutrients in blueberries are anthocyanins, a type found in other fruits and vegetables with red, blue and purple pigments. Scientists use a test called the O.R.A.C. (short for oxygen radical absorbance capacity) to rate the antioxidant capacity in foods, and by this measure blueberries always come out on top. So if red wine is off limits and beets just aren\u2019t your thing, try adding a half cup of blueberries to your cereal or yogurt in the morning, throw a half cup of frozen blueberries into your smoothie \u2014 or try any of this week\u2019s recipes. This beautiful parfait tastes so much richer than it is. You can serve it for breakfast or for dessert. Look for organic yogurt that has no thickeners or gums added to it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/01/25/health/25recipehealth_600/25recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "dessert, healthy", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 39}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 220, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "48 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups blueberries", "1/4 cup sugar", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice", "1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "2 cups drained low-fat yogurt or low-fat Greek style yogurt", "1 tablespoon shelled pistachios, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the blueberries, sugar, lime juice and balsamic vinegar in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat.
