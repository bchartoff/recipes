In a bowl, combine everything but the bacon. Mix, using your hands, until well blended. In a roasting pan or iron skillet, shape the mixture into a lobster. With the ketchup, either rub a thin coating all over the lobster or make lines for visual appeal. Wrap the bacon slices across the tail or at joints, so everyone gets a little. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, covering the \"claws\" with foil after 40 minutes so that they don't dry out."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1773-aunt-noras-mock-lobster"}
