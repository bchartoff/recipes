They\u2019re built on simple, slice-and-bake French shortbread cookies, rich, buttery and flavored with vanilla. The shortbread base is almost classic, except that the cookies are baked in muffin tins, so they\u2019re straight-sided and deeply golden brown. The \u201cfilling\u201d is lemon curd, and the topping is crunchy bits of meringue. You get crumbly, velvety and crackly, sweet and tart in every bite. These cookies were created for an imaginary friend, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, the hero of 16 Louise Penny novels, and a man who considers lemon meringue divine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/29/magazine/29mag-eat/29mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "butter, confectioners' sugar, egg, sugar, vanilla", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 893}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 large egg white, at room temperature", "1/4 teaspoon distilled vinegar (or lemon juice)", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut into chunks and brought to room temperature, plus more for greasing the muffin tin", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 large egg yolks, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "2 cups plus 2 tablespoons/270 grams all-purpose flour", "About 1/3 cup/80 grams store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019737-lemon-curd\">homemade lemon curd</a>"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the meringue: Heat oven to 250 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
