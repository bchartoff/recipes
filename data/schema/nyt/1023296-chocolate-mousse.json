{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Mousse", "description": "Each mouthful of this dessert is a marvel: as light as a meringue pie topping, but with the eggy silkiness of a creamy chocolate custard. This mousse has a particularly airy texture, but is still a little rich from the bittersweet chocolate, which makes it the ideal not-too-sweet dessert. Because the mousse develops an even deeper flavor over time, it\u2019s perfect for parties. You can make it up to five days ahead of time and serve it straight from the refrigerator.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/06/dining/01korex/merlin_209008524_f639ac41-732a-4085-b1b3-98a3f9bd648b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, parfaits and trifles, dessert", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, heavy cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 515}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/120 grams heavy cream, plus more if needed and for serving if you\u2019d like", "12 ounces/340 grams bittersweet chocolate, coarsely broken or chopped (see Tip)", "8 large egg whites (265 grams/1 cup)", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "4 large egg yolks (56 grams)", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring an inch of water to a boil in a medium saucepan.
