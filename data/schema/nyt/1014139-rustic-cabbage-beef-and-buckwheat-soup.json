In Provence you might dig into a beef daube. But since the distinctive accent of Proven\u00e7al terroir was not so evident in the glass, I went elsewhere.This thick, rustic beef soup relies on a winter larder: cabbage, celery, turnips and even buckwheat groats. Some smoke from bacon and paprika echoes the wines. And a whiff of orange zest sends a postcard from Provence.
