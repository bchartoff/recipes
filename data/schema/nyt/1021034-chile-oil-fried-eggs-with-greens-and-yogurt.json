{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chile-Oil Fried Eggs With Greens and Yogurt", "description": "This recipe, adapted from a dish served at MeMe\u2019s Diner in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, is a brunch power move. Eggs sit atop wilted greens on a bed of yogurt, all surrounded by seeded chile oil. The fresh yogurt cuts through the chile oil\u2019s heat, and the seed mix adds layers of flavor and crunch. If you\u2019re feeling lazy \u2014 it is brunch after all \u2014 skip the greens, or use everything spice mix and peanuts, for the seed mix. But don\u2019t skimp on the chile oil: It\u2019s the best part. Scale it up to have extra on hand for future use, or use store-bought if you like. (You\u2019ll need about 1 cup for four servings.) Serve with toast, to sop up the extra oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Krysten Chambrot"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/22/dining/kc-meme-diner-eggs/merlin_171456846_e6f0020f-831f-4890-85ef-9f573a60d1d2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, main course", "keywords": "cinnamon stick, egg, egg dish, ginger, greek yogurt, kale, red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 438}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons red-pepper flakes", "1 small cinnamon stick", "1 whole star anise", "3/4 teaspoon green cardamom pods (about 15 pods), optional", "1/2 teaspoon whole fennel seeds", "1/4 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "1 cup neutral oil, such as canola or safflower", "1 garlic clove, peeled and smashed", "1 (1/4-inch) piece fresh ginger, thinly sliced (optional)", "2 tablespoons black or white sesame seeds (or a mix)", "2 tablespoons pepitas or sunflower seeds (or a mix)", "2 tablespoons whole roasted, salted peanuts", "1 1/2 teaspoons garlic flakes, chopped dried garlic chips or onion flakes", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola, plus more as needed", "1 large bunch curly kale (about 1/2 pound), stems removed and leaves torn into bite-size pieces", "Kosher salt", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, champagne vinegar or white vinegar", "1/2 tablespoon toasted red-pepper flakes (from the bottom of the chile oil)", "Neutral oil, such as canola", "4 to 8 eggs", "1 cup plain Greek yogurt, at room temperature", "Flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chile oil (or skip to Step 4 if using store-bought chile oil): Add red-pepper flakes to a heatproof container that can balance a fine-mesh sieve and comfortably hold at least 1 cup oil.
