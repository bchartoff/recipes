{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Instant Pot Dakdori Tang", "description": "Dakdori tang, sometimes called dakbokkeum-tang, is an easy-to-make Korean braised chicken stew. It gets its deeply savory flavor and brick-red color from gochugaru, Korean red-pepper flakes, and gochujang, the spicy, pungent and sweet fermented red chile paste. Most traditional recipes call for braising bone-in, skin-on chicken parts without browning them first, resulting in a rich dish with a layer of very delicious chicken fat on top. If you prefer a leaner broth, you can remove the skin from half the chicken parts before starting, or simply ladle some of the fat off the top before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/04/dining/sd-Instant-Pot-Dakdori-Tang/merlin_195254355_b5cdb1af-f7ea-4987-91e2-ce715e58a863-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "chicken, gochujang, instant pot", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 759}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes (about 2 large potatoes), scrubbed and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "1 pound carrots (about 4 large carrots), peeled and sliced into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "10 garlic cloves, smashed and roughly chopped", "1 yellow or red onion, roughly chopped", "1 long green Korean chile (cheong-gochu) stemmed and thickly sliced (or 1 jalape\u00f1o, stemmed, seeded and thickly sliced)", "1/2 cup gochujang", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "3 tablespoons gochugaru (see Tip)", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger (from about 2 inches of ginger root)", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar, plus more to taste", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "3 1/4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken drumsticks, thighs, or a combination (about 8 to 12 pieces)", "4 scallions, sliced", "Sesame seeds, for topping", "Cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker, combine the potatoes, carrots, garlic, onion, green chile, gochujang, soy sauce, gochugaru, ginger, sugar, sesame oil and 1 1/2 cups water.
