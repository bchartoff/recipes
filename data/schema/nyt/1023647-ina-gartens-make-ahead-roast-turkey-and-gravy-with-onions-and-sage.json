As I mentioned in my book \u201cMake It Ahead\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2014), I discovered that I could roast the turkey early in the day, carve it and arrange it on a layer of gravy on an oven-to-table platter. It changed my Thanksgiving game plan. I prepare the platter, set it aside at room temperature, then reheat it all before dinner. Delicious turkey without the stress!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ina Garten"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/16INAREX6-turkey-and-gravy/merlin_215611602_1e5f660b-0afc-4cde-81e6-e9befd001894-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P3DT5H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken broth, cognac, dry white wine, plan-ahead, sage, thyme, whole turkey, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 457}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves", "Grated zest of 1 lemon", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 (12- to 14-pound) fresh turkey", "1 large yellow onion, unpeeled and cut in eighths", "1 lemon, quartered", "8 sprigs fresh thyme", "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted", "6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter", "1 large red onion, halved and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "4 large garlic cloves, peeled and halved", "6 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "4 cups good chicken stock", "2 tablespoons Cognac or brandy", "10 large fresh sage leaves", "2 bay leaves", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brine the turkey: 2 or 3 days before you plan to roast the turkey, combine the thyme, lemon zest and 3 tablespoons salt.
