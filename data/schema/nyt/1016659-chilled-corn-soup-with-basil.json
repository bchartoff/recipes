This one stars sweet corn that\u2019s been tarted up with buttermilk and lime juice, spiced with garlic and scallion, and imbued with fresh herbs. While straining it isn\u2019t entirely necessary, it will give you a smoother, more elegant soup. But when it\u2019s too hot to breathe, let alone dig out the strainer, you have our permission to skip it. Serve this in espresso cups or shot glasses as an hors d\u2019oeuvre, or in bowls as a first course.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/09/multimedia/clark-corn-soup/clark-corn-soup-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "basil, corn, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 406}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 108, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "428 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ears corn, shucked", "1 1/2 cups buttermilk", "1/2 cup basil leaves, more for garnish", "3 scallions, roughly chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, more to taste", "1 fat garlic clove, roughly chopped", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Radish slices, for garnish", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice kernels off corn cobs (you should have 3 to 3 1/2 cups kernels).
