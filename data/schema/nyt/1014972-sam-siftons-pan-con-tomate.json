{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sam Sifton's Pan Con Tomate", "description": "Pan con tomate is traditionally a humble dish, a way to make a single tomato and some old bread serve a family for lunch. For Tertulia's version, use a box grater to shred the best tomato you can find. Microplane some garlic into it. Add salt and a big drizzle of fruity Spanish olive oil, then a little less of sherry vinegar. You'll heap this mixture onto a few thick slices of bread, and then scrape most of the tomato off. Add more olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/18/magazine/18eat/18eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves4-6", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, bread, tomato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 78}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 116, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "178 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 best-quality tomatoes, very ripe", "4 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, ideally Spanish, plus extra for finishing", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "4-6 slices thick-cut crusty bread", "Maldon sea salt or other flaky salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate the tomatoes on a box grater.
