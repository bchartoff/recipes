Cubes of fresh mozzarella add to the overall creaminess and lend a stretchy, gooey bite. It\u2019s a dish as convenient as it is stunning;  you can assemble the torte up to 24 hours ahead and store it in the refrigerator until you\u2019re ready to bake. You may need to add a few minutes onto the baking time, so watch it closely toward the end. Then serve it for brunch, a light supper or as a first course at a dinner party.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/13/multimedia/clark-spring-torte/clark-spring-torte-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pastries", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, herbs, ricotta, ricotta salata", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 250}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 374, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "477 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds/680 grams/3 1/4 cups fresh whole-milk ricotta", "1/2 cup/45 grams shredded ricotta salata", "1/4 cup/28 grams pecorino Romano \u00a0", "3 large eggs", "1 cup chopped soft spring herbs or baby greens (any combination of dill, mint, sorrel, chives, dandelion, parsley,  arugula)", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "3/4 cup/1 1/2 sticks/170 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1 1-pound box phyllo dough, thawed overnight in refrigerator", "1/2 cup/70 grams diced prosciutto", "1/2 cup/62 grams cubed mozzarella"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
