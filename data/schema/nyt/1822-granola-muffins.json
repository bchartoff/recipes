{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Granola Muffins", "description": "These muffins are ludicrously easy to make. It's just a matter of mixing flour, baking soda and a pinch of salt in one bowl; stirring together buttermilk, an egg, vegetable oil and sugar in another; then combining the two. At the end, fold in some granola, though if you wanted to cut out one step, you could add the granola along with the flour in the bowl of dry ingredients.\nBake and eat 20 minutes or so after you\u2019ve taken them out of the oven. You can even measure out all the ingredients the night before, so all you need to do upon waking is stumble into the kitchen, switch on the oven and stir everything together.
