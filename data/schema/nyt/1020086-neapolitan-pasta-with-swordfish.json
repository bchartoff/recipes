{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Neapolitan Pasta With Swordfish", "description": "The lusty foods and intense wines of southern Italy provide inspiration to spare for cooks and connoisseurs. San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, succulent olives, tender pastas and fragrant olive oils, alone or combined, spell sheer enjoyment. The roots of red-sauce Italian, ever popular in the United States, are in the south \u2014 in Campania and Naples (its capital city) as well as in Puglia and Basilicata. This recipe is a riff on the traditional pasta alla puttanesca, with tomato, capers, olives and garlic, but without the anchovies. The recipe goes bigger on the fish front, with chunks of seared swordfish to bolster the mixture with meaty, briny notes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/dining/14pairrex1/14pairrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fish, pasta, tomatoes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 72}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 524, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "568 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 1/4 pounds swordfish steaks, skin removed, in 3/4-inch cubes", "Salt and ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons capers in vinegar or salt, large ones if possible, rinsed and dried", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced garlic", "1 1/2 cups canned San Marzano tomatoes, chopped", "18 pitted Kalamata olives", "1 pound short pasta like casarecce, cavatelli, strozzapreti or penne", "Grated zest of 1 lemon", "1 tablespoon minced flat-leaf parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large saut\u00e9 pan (4 quarts or more) on high heat, add 3 tablespoons of the oil and when it\u2019s mighty hot (a piece of fish should sizzle) add the swordfish, spreading the pieces around in the pan in a single layer.
