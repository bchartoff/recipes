{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooked Lamb Shoulder With Green Beans", "description": "There are many ways to achieve a succulent braised lamb shoulder. In a covered grill over indirect heat or in a low oven, it will take about 3 hours, but you could also use a countertop slow cooker. It\u2019ll take longer but you\u2019ll know the meat is ready when it\u2019s well seasoned and nearly falling apart. For convenience, you may prepare the braise a day or two in advance. Then finish it, cooking it with green beans (or a mixture of various summer beans) and hot pepper, then showering it with chopped parsley, dill and mint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/13/dining/05tanisrex2-lamb/05tanisrex2-lamb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, roasts, main course", "keywords": "green beans, herbs, lamb shoulder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 271}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3-pound) boneless lamb shoulder roast", "Salt and pepper", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped garlic", "4 rosemary sprigs", "6 bay leaves", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 pound green beans, preferably a mix of green beans, romano beans and yellow wax beans", "Red-pepper flakes", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish", "2 tablespoons chopped dill, for garnish", "2 tablespoons chopped mint, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a covered gas or charcoal grill for medium indirect heat, or heat an oven to 325 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If the roast is tied, remove netting or string.
