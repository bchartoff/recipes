When they're in season, pleasantly bitter dandelion greens are lovely here. But any structured greens with a tendency to wilt when cooked, like escarole, kale and even Swiss chard, will work here, so feel free to use whatever you have on hand. Olives and raisins, tossed in at the very end, add some salty and sweet notes. Round out the meal with a loaf of crusty bread \u2014 it's perfect to sop up this brothy braise.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/colu-chicken-olives-horizontal/colu-chicken-olives-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thighs, greens, olives, raisins, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 224}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 518, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "745 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "1/2 red onion or 2 to 3 medium shallots, thinly sliced (about 1 cup)", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1 to 2 bunches sturdy greens, such as dandelion, escarole, Swiss chard or kale,\u00a0roughly chopped\u00a0(about 8 cups)", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup green olives,\u00a0pitted and roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons raisins", "2 tablespoons finely chopped Italian parsley (optional)", "Flaky salt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken thighs well with salt and pepper.
