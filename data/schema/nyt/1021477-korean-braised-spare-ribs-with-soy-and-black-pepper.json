{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Korean Braised Spare Ribs With Soy and Black Pepper", "description": "These St. Louis-style spareribs are braised until tender and lacquered in a savory Korean soy sauce glaze that\u2019s spiked with fragrant garlic, ginger, scallions and lots of black pepper. There\u2019s no marinating required and little hands-on work, but you will need to make sure the tough membrane on the back of each rack has been removed before cooking. (That task is easy: Set the ribs meat side down and find the thin, translucent skin that sits over the bones. Gently pull it up at one corner, inserting a sharp knife to loosen it at one end if necessary, then peel the membrane off in one piece.) The potatoes and carrots sit underneath the ribs and soak up the meaty drippings. The pork and vegetables all release flavorful juices as they roast, resulting in a rich, assertive pan sauce. A quick broil at the end achieves golden, crispy edges.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/14/dining/kc-korean-short-ribs/merlin_180213510_80c5e583-9a1d-49b3-8f97-01b0d1c0c18e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "carrot, garlic, ginger, kimchi, potato, ribs, scallion, soy sauce, spare ribs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 239}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 cup finely chopped scallions (from about 4 scallions), plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup minced garlic", "1/4 cup minced fresh ginger (from one 4-inch piece)", "2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "2 tablespoons turbinado or brown sugar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 (3-pound) St. Louis-style sparerib racks, each halved crosswise into 2 equal pieces", "2 small yellow onions, thinly sliced into 1/8-inch-thick rounds (about 2 cups)", "1 1/2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled and sliced crosswise 1-inch-thick", "1 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled and halved lengthwise", "Any combination of kimchi, pickles or cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
