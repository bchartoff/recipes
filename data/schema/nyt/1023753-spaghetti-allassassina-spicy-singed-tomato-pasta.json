{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaghetti all'Assassina (Spicy Singed Tomato Pasta)", "description": "This spicy one-pot pasta dish is common on menus in Bari, Italy, but can easily be prepared at home. Like many classic dishes, there are a couple versions of its origin story. According to one, a distracted chef accidentally left his pasta cooking until the sauce burned, while another attributes the recipe title to the dish\u2019s killer spiciness. The method involves treating spaghetti as you would risotto: Heat some garlic, red-pepper flakes and tomato paste in oil, then add the pasta and cook it gently, slowly adding tomato broth little by little. Once the pasta soaks up the flavorful liquid, it starts to char. Bari is famous for serving this dish extra \u201cpiccante,\u201d but at home, you can make it as mild or spicy as you wish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Anna Francese Gass"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/23/multimedia/afg-spaghetti-alla-assassina-1-19ef/afg-spaghetti-alla-assassina-1-19ef-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, one pot, pastas, main course", "keywords": "red pepper flake, spaghetti, tomato sauce, weeknight, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 265}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups jarred or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015178-marcella-hazans-tomato-sauce\">homemade tomato sauce</a>", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes, or more to taste", "1 garlic clove, thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons tomato paste", "1 pound (uncooked) spaghetti"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, heat the tomato sauce with 3 1/2 cups water over medium heat.
