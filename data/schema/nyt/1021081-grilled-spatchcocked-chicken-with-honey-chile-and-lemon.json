A low-temperature grill and attentive flipping are essential to cooking the bird through without singeing the outside. Pay close attention to the skin during the first few minutes of cooking to make sure the grill isn\u2019t too hot, then turn and baste regularly to cultivate bronzed, savory-sweet skin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clare de Boer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/dining/18chickenrex1/18chickenrex1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT14H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "chicken, chickpea, greek yogurt, grilled chicken, honey, lemon, oregano", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 592}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) chicken", "2 tablespoons sea salt", "4 lemons", "1/3 cup clear, runny honey", "2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1 teaspoon dried Calabrian chile flakes or red-pepper flakes", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "Greek yogurt, for serving (optional)", "1 garlic clove", "2 tablespoons fresh oregano or marjoram leaves", "Sea salt", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before cooking, spatchcock and season the chicken: Remove the spindly wing tips by cutting through the first wing joint with heavy-duty kitchen scissors.
