They are mixed with spicy salami to complement their sweetness. You can use any cured meat with a kick, such as black pepper salami, cubed Spanish chorizo or torn soppressata. Whole-milk ricotta, made extra creamy with \u201cmilk\u201d scraped from the corn cobs, is spread on crusty bread, then topped with the salad of melon, corn, salami, plus almonds and cilantro. Play with the balance of sweet, spicy, juicy and crunchy by adding fresh chile, thinly sliced cucumbers or snap peas or swapping the melon for stone fruit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/25/dining/20NO-COOKREX3-Ricotta-Toasts-with-Melon-Salami/merlin_191889846_be7aa3f7-6a87-48fd-bb33-2225412312b9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches", "keywords": "bread, cantaloupe, corn, salami", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 89}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ears of corn, kernels removed, cobs reserved", "1 cup whole-milk ricotta (8 ounces)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup chopped cantaloupe", "1/2 cup chopped spicy or black pepper salami (about 2 1/2 ounces; if using pre-sliced salami, rip into smaller pieces)", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves and stems, finely chopped", "6 tablespoons roasted, salted almonds or Marcona almonds, coarsely chopped", "2 teaspoons Sherry vinegar, plus more as needed", "1 baguette or another sturdy bread, like ciabatta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use the blunt edge of a knife to scrape any corn milk off the cobs into a medium bowl.
