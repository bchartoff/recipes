{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bobby Flay\u2019s Pan-Roasted Chicken With Mint Sauce", "description": "Bobby Flay served a version of this chicken at Bolo, the elegant little jewel box of a restaurant he had on 22nd Street until 2007, when the building that housed it was sold. It came pan-roasted beneath a blanket of what Flay called Spanish spices, with a vibrant green mint sauce rich with chiles, honey, salt and mustard. The dish was one of the restaurant\u2019s best sellers. I ate it about 3,000 times there before getting the recipe and adapting it for those of us who cook at home. Of course you can make the exact same dish with chicken thighs if you want. But some will prefer the breast meat. Some always have.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/magazine/29eat/29eat-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 559}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 687, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "55 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "609 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts", "Kosher salt to taste", "2 tablespoons Spanish paprika", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "2 teaspoons ground mustard", "2 teaspoons ground fennel seed", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup fresh mint leaves", "\u00bd cup fresh parsley leaves", "4 cloves garlic, peeled and roughlychopped", "1 serrano chile, seeds removed androughly chopped", "1 tablespoon honey", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "\u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly groundblack pepper."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425.
