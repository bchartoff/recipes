{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Tea and Whiskey Cooler", "description": "Florida A&M, or FAMU, the historically Black college and university founded in 1887 in Tallahassee, canceled its homecoming celebrations for 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This whiskey cooler from Shameeka Ayers, an alumna, is Florida sunshine beamed into a glass. The orange and green are inspired by FAMU's colors; Ms. Ayers calls the drink the Three Strike,  inspired by the school's \u201cStrike, Strike and Strike Again\u201d chant. The black tea adds depth and is refreshing year-round. The Uncle Nearest whiskey honors Nathan \"Nearest\" Green, the enslaved African who taught Jack Daniels how to distill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nicole Taylor"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/14/dining/12brunchrex3/merlin_178199808_bfa8b3b5-65be-4617-9d7d-eb9f82d5c62e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "black tea, mint, orange liqueur, tea, vanilla, whiskey, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 138}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 black tea bags or 1 tablespoon loose black tea", "4 large mint leaves, plus extra mint sprigs to garnish", "Ice, as needed", "4 ounces small-batch whiskey, such as Uncle Nearest 1884", "4 ounces peach nectar (or mango nectar)", "1 ounce orange liqueur", "1/2 ounce pure vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the tea: Place a kettle over high and bring 2 1/2 cups water to a boil.
