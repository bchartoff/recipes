{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Caramelized Cabbage, Anchovies and Bread Crumbs", "description": "This dish is hearty and robust, with a savory backbone from the anchovies, sage and pecorino, as well as a bite from the red chile flakes. (A note to anchovy haters: add them anyway. They dissolve into the sauce and add complexity without any fishiness.)\nAlthough I used regular pasta, I think farro pasta or whole-wheat pasta would also have stood up to the brawny flavors of the dish. Or, if you wanted to take this in a meatier direction, you could substitute bacon for anchovies, reducing the olive oil and using some of the bacon fat to cook the cabbage. Pork products and cabbage are a match made in heaven, or at least in much of Eastern Europe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/28/dining/cabbagepasta-still/cabbagepasta-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 920}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 550, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "503 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 anchovy fillets", "1/2 cup coarse bread crumbs", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more, to taste", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1 pound dry penne", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon red chile flakes", "8 cups shredded cabbage", "2/3 cup grated pecorino or Parmesan."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mince one garlic clove.
