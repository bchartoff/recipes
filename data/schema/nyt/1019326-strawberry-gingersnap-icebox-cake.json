{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Gingersnap Icebox Cake", "description": "Fluffy swirls of strawberry cream are layered with spicy gingersnaps in this summery, no-bake confection. The deep strawberry flavor comes through twice here: once in the mascarpone cream, which is whipped with berry pur\u00e9e, and in a scarlet topping spiked with lime zest and grated fresh ginger. We used Nabisco gingersnaps, but any brand should work, as could vanilla wafers. This cake is best made the day before you want to serve it, giving the gingersnaps a chance to soften into a luscious, soft cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/30/dining/30appetite3/30appetite3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes, ice dishes", "keywords": "dessert, gingersnaps, lime, mascarpone, strawberries, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 888}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 305, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "271 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/455 grams strawberries", "12 ounces/340 grams mascarpone", "1/4 cup/28 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, more as needed", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/4 teaspoons finely grated lime zest, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon fresh lime juice, more to taste", "32 gingersnaps (about 8 ounces)", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger, more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set aside half the strawberries, choosing the smallest, prettiest ones.
