Edna Lewis calls for Seckel pears, but this recipe works for Bosc or other varieties that will keep their shape when cooked. If you have to substitute, try to find smaller fruit, and halve them lengthwise if needed to fit in the pan. The leftover syrup is delicious in drinks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Francis Lam"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/01/magazine/01spicedpears/01spicedpears-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H", "recipeYield": "2 1/2 pounds pears, plus about 2 cups syrup", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, pear", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 413, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "105 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "63 milligrams", "sugarContent": "96 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon cloves", "1 1/2 pounds dark brown sugar", "1 1/2 cups vinegar", "Pinch of salt", "2 1/2 pounds pears"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saucepan over medium heat, toast the cloves, shaking the pan, until they\u2019re very aromatic.
