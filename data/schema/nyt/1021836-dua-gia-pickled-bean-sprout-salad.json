But it is eaten in large amounts like a salad, usually with intensely flavored <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021834-suon-kho-pork-ribs-in-savory-caramel-sauce\">fish or pork kho (dishes simmered in savory caramel sauce)</a>. The vegetables provide a refreshing contrast to the inky, deep flavors of kho but they\u2019re also terrific paired with dumplings or sandwiches. The bean sprouts and carrot are typically combined with flat Chinese chives.
