{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Ice Cream", "description": "The combination of high-fat hemp and coconut milks gives this nondairy ice cream base an ultra-creamy texture, with a taste mild enough not to obscure any flavorings. The liquid sugar (corn syrup or agave syrup) along with a little vodka help to keep ice crystals from forming, giving the smoothest texture. If you can't find hemp milk, substitute cashew milk. It has a similar fat content, though the flavor is slightly less neutral. Nondairy ice cream is best eaten within a week of freezing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/12/dining/00Icecream21/00Icecream21-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 quart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "coconut cream, corn syrup, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 142}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups hemp or cashew milk", "1 (14.5-ounce) can coconut cream or whole coconut milk (not refrigerated nondairy beverage or light coconut milk)", "1/2 cup light corn syrup or substitute 1/3 cup agave syrup", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon vodka (optional)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Your choice of flavoring (see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, combine hemp or cashew milk, coconut cream, corn syrup, sugar and salt, and bring to a simmer.
