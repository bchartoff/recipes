It takes a little time, but your efforts will be rewarded with a spectacular centerpiece dessert to be proud of: a cloud of toasted meringue atop a pool of buttery and bright lemon curd in a light and flaky crust. If you can't find Meyer lemons, regular supermarket lemons will make a worthy substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Leslie Land"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/24/dining/24MERINGUEPIE/24MERINGUEPIE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, eggs, meyer lemon, pie shell, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 559}, "recipeIngredient": ["Flaky pie crust, enough for a 9-inch shell <a href=\" http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/3305-flaky-pie-crust \">(see recipe)</a>", "2 Meyer lemons or other large lemons", "2 eggs", "3 egg yolks", "6 tablespoons sugar", "3 tablespoons salted butter, cut in 3 pieces", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut in 3 pieces", "3 egg whites, at warm room temperature", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "6 tablespoons superfine sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the shell.
