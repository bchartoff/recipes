{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Tetrazzini", "description": "Chicken tetrazzini takes its name from the Italian opera star Luisa Tetrazzini, and was a mainstay of upscale restaurant menus of the early 20th century. Today, though, it is hardly fancy. (And definitely not Italian.) The recipe that follows is built on the frame of what might be called a Mississippi-style tetrazzini, made with canned tomatoes and chiles and processed cheese. The chef Brad McDonald, who grew up in Yazoo City, at the top of the Delta, used to cook a bespoke version for his tasting menu at the Lockhart, a restaurant in London, using washed-rind Irish cheese and a mixture of roasted green bell peppers and jalape\u00f1os to flavor his shredded chicken, along with porcini mushrooms and guajillo chiles. I made a few changes of my own, and discovered a weeknight casserole of great distinction.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/02/magazine/02eat/02mag-02eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two", "keywords": "chicken, poblano pepper, porcini mushrooms, spaghetti, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 410}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 649, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "777 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms", "4 medium-size poblano peppers", "5 dried guajillo chiles, ends snipped and seeds discarded", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium", "1 1/2 cups whole milk", "3 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 medium-size shallot, peeled and thinly sliced", "8 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated", "1 pound spaghetti", "1 store-bought rotisserie chicken, the meat removed and shredded, approximately 1 pound", "1 lemon, juiced", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1/4 cup parsley, roughly chopped, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn broiler to high, and set a large pot filled with salted water over high heat to come to a boil.
