{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry-Rhubarb Slab Pie", "description": "This slab pie is perfect for a party because it\u2019s easy to transport, and it serves a crowd. Convenience aside, the true draw of this sheet-pan pie is the flaky, buttery crust and its rhubarb, blueberry and crystallized ginger filling. Cooking the fruit ahead of time results in a filling that is juicy but not soupy \u2014 and prevents the crust from absorbing too much liquid. Preparing the pie dough in the food processor is effortless and helps keep the butter cold, which leads to a flakier crust, but be careful not to over-process: Stop when the mixture is moist but still crumbly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/12/dining/ss-blueberry-slab-pie/ss-blueberry-slab-pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pastries, pies and tarts", "keywords": "blueberries, butter, crystalized ginger, flour, rhubarb, sugar, dessert, fall, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 66}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups/290 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/225 grams cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut into pieces", "Ice water, as needed", "10 ounces/290 grams fresh rhubarb, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 1/2 cups)", "4 1/2 cups/600 grams fresh blueberries", "1/3 cup maple syrup", "Pinch of kosher salt", "3 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/4 cup/60 grams chopped crystallized ginger", "1 large egg, beaten", "3 tablespoons sparkling or sanding sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pastry: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar and salt.
