{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Karaage (Japanese Fried Chicken)", "description": "At Kunyan, a ramen shop in a mountain hot-spring town near the Sea of Japan, fried chicken is served until 2 a.m., or whenever the last customer leaves. The flesh is firm and flavorful with sweetened soy and garlic, coated in a fox-colored crust of potato starch that stays crisp on the table through a second round of highballs. Kunyan\u2019s \u201cmama,\u201d who presides over pan-frying gyoza and pouring frothy Super Dry beer, would never give up her recipe, but the flavors in this version are awfully similar. To approximate the best Japanese chicken \u2014 meatier, fattier, and more flavorful than American supermarket meat \u2014 buy your chicken from a farmers' market, and debone it yourself or ask a butcher. Don\u2019t feel pressure to do it perfectly: The pieces will be encrusted in a crisp coating, and the leftover bones make great stock.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hannah Kirshner"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/25/dining/HK-karaage-horizontal/merlin_141075300_74569dec-9fc2-4174-931d-019dddef3bb8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "appetizer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 590}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 458, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "775 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger, with its juice", "2 teaspoons grated or smashed garlic (from about 3 cloves)", "2 tablespoons dry sake", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons sugar", "4 skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds), deboned, cut into 2-inch chunks", "Peanut oil, or a mixture of peanut and canola or safflower, for frying", "1 cup potato starch (katakuriko)", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Lemon wedge, for serving", "Lettuce and cucumber slices, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a shallow baking dish large enough to hold the chicken, combine ginger, garlic, sake, soy sauce and sugar.
