{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Ramp Pesto Pasta", "description": "Ramps are one of those items that seem so appealing at the market but can be a challenge to use when you get them home. This dish solves the problem. Because the recipe comes from Rachael Ray, who made her name teaching a generation to get dinner on the table in 30 minutes, it\u2019s quick to make once you have the ramps blanched. The pesto comes together fast, so you can make it while the pasta is boiling. The creaminess of the ricotta tempers the ramps, which can vary in their pungency. Pink peppercorns are berries, not true peppercorns. They add a lovely look to the finished pasta and bring a more delicate fruitiness and a quieter heat than black pepper; if you can't find them, black pepper will do just fine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/dining/09rayrex2/09rayrex2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "main course, side dish, pink peppercorns, pistachio, ramps, ricotta, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 89}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 516, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "414 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large bunch of ramps (about 1/2 pound), cleaned, roots trimmed, bulbs and stems separated from leaves", "Zest and juice of 1 lemon", "1/4 cup shelled pistachios (preferably the bright green Sicilian variety), lightly toasted", "1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt, to taste", "3/4 cup bufala ricotta, fresh cow\u2019s milk ricotta or mascarpone (6 ounces)", "1 pound fusilli lunghi or bucatini", "Freshly ground pink peppercorns, for serving (or use ground black pepper)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil for pasta.
