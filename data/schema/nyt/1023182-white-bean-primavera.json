{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Bean Primavera", "description": "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014234-pasta-primavera\">Pasta primavera</a>, the creamy, vegetable-heavy pasta dish popularized in the 1980s at Le Cirque, in New York, is a little too fussy for a busy weeknight, but this reimagined white bean version comes together in less than a half-hour. The simple beans and vegetables feel fancy in their robe of cream, Parmesan, lemon juice and mustard. The dish is best with fresh spring vegetables, and it\u2019s also very flexible: Substitute spinach for the peas, a handful of halved cherry tomatoes for the carrot, and sugar snap peas for the asparagus. Drained jarred artichoke hearts wouldn\u2019t be out of place, either.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/10/dining/sd-White-Bean-Primavera/merlin_206153154_937aac73-dbcb-4c72-af66-73fa0ece2f63-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, beans, main course, side dish", "keywords": "asparagus, heavy cream, white beans, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1308}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 medium to large zucchini, cut in half lengthwise and sliced into \u00bd-inch thick semicircles", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "8 ounces asparagus (about \u00bd large bunch) or green beans, or a mix, cut into 1-inch lengths", "1 carrot, peeled, then shaved into strips with a peeler", "5 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 cup fresh or frozen peas (no need to thaw)", "2 scallions, green and white parts, sliced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "Black pepper", "3 (15-ounce) cans butter beans or cannellini beans, drained", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "1 tablespoon lemon juice (from about 1/2 large lemon), plus more to taste", "2 ounces grated Parmesan (about \u00bd cup), plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds or pine nuts", "Fresh basil leaves, torn, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet (preferably straight-sided) over medium-high heat.
