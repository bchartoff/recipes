{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Celery Salad With Wasabi-Tahini Dressing", "description": "Inspired by the desire to make use of some leftover wasabi paste, this is the kind of chicken salad that\u2019s sure to become a go-to recipe. The best advice here is to make a large batch, and save it for multiple meals. Equally delicious cold or at room temperature, this salad is especially good in a sandwich, tucked into soft potato rolls. Embrace the wasabi and think of it as a hot mustard; you can even dial it back, starting with less, then adding more to taste. Lime juice lends a mellow acidity that rounds out the dressing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/22/dining/20saladrex/merlin_174651774_2b91e62c-bec8-4b23-a578-a74095819cd4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, poultry, salads and dressings, main course", "keywords": "celery, chicken breast, lime, sesame seeds, tahini, wasabi", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 709}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 small boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound total)", "Kosher salt", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice, plus more lime wedges, for serving (3 to 4 limes)", "1/4 cup tahini", "1 to 2 tablespoons wasabi paste", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "8 to 10 celery ribs, plus 1/2 cup celery leaves", "Sesame seeds, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, cover chicken breasts with about 2 inches of water, and season with 2 tablespoons kosher salt.
