Instead of merely boiling the broccoli to cook it, here, the florets are seared until deeply browned on one side while remaining bright green on the other. This gives the soup a layer of caramelized flavor while also preserving the fresh green taste of the broccoli itself. It\u2019s a technique inspired by Andrew Feinberg of Franny\u2019s restaurant in Brooklyn, who also uses it for zucchini soup. In this version, we\u2019ve added potato for body, chile flakes for spice and lemon zest to heighten the citrus tang at the end.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/18/multimedia/clark-broccoli-soup/clark-broccoli-soup-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for one, for two, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, broccoli, potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1964}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "565 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 heads broccoli (about 2 pounds), separated into small florets, stems peeled and diced", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large Spanish onion, diced", "5 cloves garlic, chopped", "1/2 teaspoons black pepper, more for finishing", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1/2 pound potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced", "1/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, more to taste", "Grated Parmesan, to finish", "Flaky sea salt, to finish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large soup pot, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat.
