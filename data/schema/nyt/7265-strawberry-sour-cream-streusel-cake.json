But here's the interesting thing: Eat it slightly warm and it's dessert; let it get cold, and it makes a great coffee cake for breakfast the next day. The cake is slightly tricky to assemble, and at some point it may look like a mess. But everything comes together in the pan as it bakes, resulting in a tender, fragrant cake. This isn\u2019t a recipe to embark on at the end of a long workday.
