{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Amaranth, Ricotta and Greens Pancakes", "description": "These pancakes are inspired by another recipe, for rice, beet greens and ricotta blinis. They are made with amaranth, a high-protein, gluten-free grain and have a lighter texture than the rice cakes. Cooked amaranth is good in baked goods and griddled cakes because it\u2019s so moist. I cooked the amaranth in homemade turkey stock (made and frozen after Thanksgiving), and the stock gave it a very nice flavor; I recommend cooking it in some kind of flavorful stock, whether it\u2019s  vegetable, chicken or turkey.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/10/health/10recipehealth/10recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 20  2 1/2- to 3-inch cakes, serving 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "halal, healthy, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 13}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 358, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "643 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup amaranth", "1 cup chicken stock or vegetable stock", "Salt to taste", "1 large bunch chard, stemmed and washed ", "1 cup (8 ounces) ricotta cheese", "2 eggs, beaten", "1/2 cup low-fat milk (2 percent)", "5 tablespoons grated Parmesan", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole-wheat pastry flour or white whole-wheat pastry flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 medium onion, finely chopped (about 2/3 cup)", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "Freshly ground pepper", "Olive oil or butter for the pan or griddle", "Marinara sauce for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the amaranth.
