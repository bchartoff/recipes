{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roy Choi's Carne Asada", "description": "Roy Choi is the dharma bum of the Los Angeles food scene, a Zen lunatic bard of the city\u2019s immigrant streets. He is a founder of Kogi BBQ, which used food trucks to introduce the city to Mexican mash-up cuisine, and the creative force behind a handful of Los Angeles restaurants that celebrate various iterations of big-flavor cooking at the intersection of skater, stoner, lowrider and Korean college-kid desire. He cooks poems, and they taste of Los Angeles. Choi's carne asada \u2014 grilled meat \u2014 might raise eyebrows in Puebla and Laredo alike. There is mirin in the marinade and a lot of garlic. But there is purity to its expression of urban Southern California. This is a recipe to expand minds, a delicious take on a venerable classic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/15/magazine/15Eat1/15Eat1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beer, cilantro, skirt steak, dairy-free, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 592}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 429, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "692 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 jalape\u00f1os", "1 medium tomato, cored and cut into quarters", "1 small yellow onion or 1/4 large one, peeled and cut into quarters", "5 cloves garlic", "2 tablespoons white granulated sugar", "1/4 cup ancho chili powder", "1 tablespoon ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1/2 large bunch cilantro, leaves and stems, well rinsed", "1/3 cup fresh-squeezed orange juice (about 1 orange)", "3 tablespoons fresh-squeezed lime juice (1 or 2 limes)", "1/4 cup mirin", "1 12-ounce can (1 1/2 cups) Budweiser or other lager beer", "2 pounds skirt steak, cut into 10-inch sections", "2 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the broiler.
