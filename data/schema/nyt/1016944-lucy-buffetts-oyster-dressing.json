{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lucy Buffett\u2019s Oyster Dressing", "description": "Lucy Buffett and her famous brother, Jimmy, grew up in Mobile, Ala., where seafood from the Gulf of Mexico is a key player in the culinary canon. Mr. Buffett went on to a giant career in music. His sister Lucy opened the freewheeling LuLu\u2019s restaurant in Gulf Shores, Ala. When they were children, oyster stuffing was always on the Thanksgiving table. And it still is. \u201cUsually, it\u2019s all gone by the end of the day because the kids go back for thirds and fourths, just digging directly into the pan,\u201d she said. \n\nMs. Buffett likes to use cornbread with a little sugar in it, often relying on a box mix. But any cornbread recipe will do. The best bread is an inexpensive white loaf from the grocery store that will break down into a smooth texture. The oysters don\u2019t have to be from the Gulf of Mexico, but fat Gulf oysters are best for conjuring the brackish low tides and sunsets of the Buffett family youth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19ALABAMA/19ALABAMA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "cornbread, oyster, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 313}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 295, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "381 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons/1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, divided, plus more for baking dish", "1 (8-inch-square) baked and cooled cornbread, preferably on the sweet side", "15 slices white or wheat bread, toasted and cooled", "1/2 large white onion, finely chopped", "2 celery ribs, finely chopped", "1/2 large green bell pepper, finely chopped", "1/2 cup chicken broth, plus more as needed", "2 dozen freshly shucked or jarred oysters, preferably Gulf oysters, drained and coarsely chopped (reserve the oyster liquor)", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 tablespoon hot sauce, preferably Crystal", "1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh sage, finely chopped, or 1 teaspoon ground sage", "1 1/2 teaspoons truffle salt or sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
