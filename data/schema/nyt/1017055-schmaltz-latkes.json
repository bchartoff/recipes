It makes for an exceptional latke:  crisp-edged and deeply flavored, with a nutty, rich flavor that\u2019s much more complex than if you fry them in flavorless vegetable oil. For the best results, make the batter for these just before frying and serve immediately. Also keep in mind that serving these with the optional sour cream or yogurt makes them unsuitable to anyone keeping kosher. If you\u2019re making schmaltz from scratch for this recipe, do use the onion; it adds a lovely caramelized sweetness to the mix. The gribenes, which are the crispy bits of chicken skin that fry in the rendered fat, make an excellent garnish. (They are usually strained out of store-bought schmaltz; if you don\u2019t have them, just omit them here.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/10/dining/10JPSCHMALTZ1/10JP-SCHMALTZ1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 9 latkes (3 to 4 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "russet potatoes, schmaltz, shallot, sour cream, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large russet potato (about 10 ounces), peeled and quartered lengthwise", "1 shallot, peeled and halved lengthwise", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 large egg", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "Schmaltz, for frying (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017054-schmaltz-and-gribenes\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>)", "Sour cream or Greek yogurt, for serving (optional)", "Applesauce, for serving (optional)", "Gribenes, for garnish (optional, <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017054-schmaltz-and-gribenes\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a food processor with a coarse grating disc, grate potato and shallot.
