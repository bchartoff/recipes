{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Lamb Chops With Fennel and Cucumber", "description": "One of the quickest-cooking cuts out there, lamb loin chops are leaner than a rib chop, with a very mild lamb flavor. Seasoning them simply with salt and pepper would be enough, but a good sprinkle of crushed fennel seed and plenty of black pepper adds excellent crispy, crunchy bits to the seared meat. Serve squeezed with lemon and scattered with herbs alongside a cucumber salad, or with an herby bowl of rice or other grains.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/17/dining/17Romanrex2-copy/17Romanrex2-copy-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, meat", "keywords": "cucumber, fennel, lamb chops, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 158}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 230, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "390 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon fennel seed", "1 1/2 pounds lamb loin chops, about 1-inch thick, or individual rib chops (unfrenched)", "Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon canola oil", "1 small fennel bulb, thinly sliced", "1/2 hothouse or 1 Persian cucumber, thinly sliced", "1 small shallot, thinly sliced into rings", "2 lemons", "1/2 cup picked dill or mint leaves", "Cooked couscous, rice, farro or barley, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a knife, mortar and pestle or spice grinder, finely chop or coarsely grind fennel seed.
