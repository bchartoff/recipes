{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baba Ghanouj", "description": "As sesame tahini sits, the oil separates, so the mixture should be stirred before it\u2019s used. Sesame tahini should be slightly runny \u2014 virtually all of the imported brands that I use have this consistency, but domestic versions can be thick and pasty, and a bit flavorless. You can find imported tahini in Mediterranean markets and in many grocery stores. It must be stored in the refrigerator once opened. Baba ghanouj is a signature Middle Eastern grilled eggplant puree enriched with tahini and seasoned with lemon juice and lots of garlic. The dish has a smoky, pungent flavor. Don\u2019t forget to pierce the eggplant before you put it on the grill. You can also grill it inside over a gas flame.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/baba-ganoush/baba-ganoush-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, healthy, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 213}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 188, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "629 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds eggplant, preferably small eggplants", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (more to taste)", "1/4 cup sesame tahini, stirred if oil has separated out", "1 to 2 tablespoons plain low-fat yogurt, as needed", "2 garlic cloves, cut in half, green shoots removed", "Salt to taste", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a hot gas or charcoal grill.

If you don\u2019t have a grill but do have a gas stove, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cover the top of your stove under the burner grates with foil to facilitate cleaning. Turn on your oven fan (so the smoke alarm won\u2019t go off), and roast the eggplants directly over the flame, turning often until charred and softened. Small, thin eggplants will cook through this way, but larger eggplants must be finished in the oven. Wrap in foil, and place in the hot oven for 20 minutes until thoroughly softened.
