Creamy canned navy beans and jasmine rice add body to a base of softened vegetables stained with turmeric. You may be tempted to add stock, but be assured that using water is enough here. The sum of the ingredients can stand on its own and doesn\u2019t need the added boost of stock. (If you do add stock, be mindful of the amount of salt you use.) The dill \u2013 which can be dried or fresh \u2013 and turmeric brighten up the soup and offer a bright reminder of spring any time of year.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/24/multimedia/nd-white-bean-rice-and-dill-soup-vqtb/nd-white-bean-rice-and-dill-soup-vqtb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, soups and stews", "keywords": "dill, rice, turmeric, white beans, vegan, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 680}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "6 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "2 large carrots, scrubbed and finely chopped", "2 celery stalks, finely chopped", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Red-pepper flakes (optional), to taste", "1/3 cup white jasmine rice, rinsed", "2 (15-ounce) cans navy beans or cannellini beans, rinsed", "1 tablespoon dried dill or 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill", "Lemon (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat the oil over medium.
