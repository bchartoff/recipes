Adjusting your mandolin accordingly, cut potatoes into matchstick shapes or, using a sharp knife, cut them by hand, rinsing blade frequently to remove starch. Place matchsticks in a bowl of ice cold water. After five minutes pour off starchy water and refill. Put bowl in the refrigerator and let potatoes soak for an hour, then drain in a colander and pat them dry with a paper towel. You might hasten the drying by spinning them in a salad spinner."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a deep, heavy kettle with a frying basket, heat oil, which should be about two inches deep, to 350 degrees. Add potatoes a handful at a time. (Do not add too many potatoes at once or you will reduce temperature. Potatoes will be soggy and won't brown.) As they begin to cook, shake basket to separate them. If they clump, poke them with a wooden spoon or tongs. When they are crisp and golden, remove them from oil with tongs. Drain on paper towels. Add salt. Repeat in batches. Keep them warm and crisp in a low oven."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10711-matchstick-potatoes"}
