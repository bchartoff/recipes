Instead of adding the leaves to the dough, the tea is steeped in melted butter for maximum flavor. If you are using loose leaf tea instead of tea from bags, use a mortar and pestle or spice grinder to finely grind it before adding it to the butter. Try adding a handful of chopped chocolate shards to the dough to make these cookies even more special.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/23/dining/ya-chewy-earl-grey-sugar-cookies/merlin_194732559_955be33c-82ea-4611-b9a3-66f3cfaa37f8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 20 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "earl grey tea, freezer friendly, make-ahead, sugar cookie", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1569}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "14 tablespoons/198 grams unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon finely ground Earl Grey tea leaves, from about 3 tea bags", "1/2 cup/100 grams light brown sugar", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest", "1 large egg", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and line two half-sheet pans with parchment paper.
