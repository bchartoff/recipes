{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Scallop-and-Halibut Ceviche Salad", "description": "This recipe came to The Times from Fanny Singer, the daughter of Alice Waters, the chef and food activist. It\u2019s inspired by Ms. Singer\u2019s favorite street food. Ceviche is almost always so astringent that the fish loses identity, but the freshness of the ingredients and softness of the lime marinade here are neither confrontational nor eye-squinching. It\u2019s simple stuff: avocado, grapefruit, prickly chile, cilantro, lime and an absolutely fresh sea creature. Making the dish takes a bit of work, but it\u2019s the perfect recipe for when you don\u2019t want to turn on the stove.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Reynolds"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/23/dining/Scallop-and-Halibut-Ceviche-Salad/Scallop-and-Halibut-Ceviche-Salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "serves 8", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean, latin american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, nut-free, halibut, lime juice, scallops, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 18}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 362, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "824 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds fresh sea scallops, sliced in half horizontally and then quartered", "1 1/4 pounds fresh skinless halibut fillet, cut into half-inch cubes", "Sea salt to taste", "2 cups lime juice (from about 16 limes)", "4 to 6 Serrano or jalape\u00f1o peppers, halved, seeded and finely chopped", "2 medium shallots, finely chopped", "1/3 cup chopped cilantro leaves, plus more for sprinkling", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "8 leaves Boston or butter lettuce", "2 grapefruits (one ruby, one white), peeled and segmented", "2 avocados, peeled and thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the scallops and halibut in separate nonreactive bowls.
