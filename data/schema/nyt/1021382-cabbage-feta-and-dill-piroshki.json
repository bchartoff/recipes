{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cabbage, Feta and Dill Piroshki", "description": "There are as many possible fillings for piroshki as there are countries that claim the yeasted, stuffed buns as their own. In Russia and Ukraine, where they are an especially popular street food, you\u2019ll find versions that are baked and versions that are fried with fillings both sweet and savory. In this baked version, the slightly sweet, butter- and egg-enriched dough encloses a filling of silky cooked green cabbage, which provides a nice counterpoint to salty feta. Once you\u2019ve made these a couple times, you might start dreaming up your own fillings. Piroshki are a wonderful way to use up odds and ends.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jessica Battilana"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/20/dining/jb-piroshki/jb-piroshki-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "15 piroshki", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european", "recipeCategory": "breads, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "butter, cabbage, dill, egg, feta, flour, onion, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 119}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 milliliters milk, warmed", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "3 to 3 1/4 cups/385 to 415 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 large egg, beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash", "4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1 onion, thinly sliced", "1 small green cabbage (about 1 1/2 pounds/680 grams), cored and cut into 1/2-inch ribbons", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup/about 225 grams crumbled feta\u00a0", "1/2 cup/30 grams finely chopped fresh dill", "Flaky salt, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or in a large bowl with a wooden spoon), combine the milk and sugar.

Gently punch down the dough, transfer to a work surface and divide into 15 pieces, each about 1 1/2 ounces/45 grams. Roll the pieces into balls, then cover them loosely with a clean dish towel. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll into a 4-inch/10-centimeter circle using a rolling pin. (If your dough is particularly sticky, you can dust your work surface with a bit of flour, but adding too much flour makes rolling the dough difficult, so be cautious.) Add 2 to 3 tablespoons filling to the center of each dough round. Pull the dough up and around the filling, pinching the dough firmly to enclose the filling. Place seam-side down, 2 inches apart, on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. (The piroshki can be made up to this point and frozen for up to 1 month. Freeze on the baking sheet, then transfer to a resealable freezer storage bag. Bake as directed below, adding 2 to 3 minutes to the total baking time.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the racks in the top and bottom third of the oven, and heat oven to 375 degrees.
