{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetable Yakisoba\u00a0", "description": "Yakisoba is a Japanese stir-fried noodle dish with a rich Worcestershire-flavored sauce. This veggie-packed version combines carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms and kale for a fun mix of textures and flavors. The key in this dish is to saut\u00e9 the yakisoba noodles first, creating a dryer, firmer noodle that won\u2019t fall apart in the sauce. (Fresh ramen noodles would also work well here.) The tangy-sweet sauce consists mainly of pantry condiments and can be made the day before. Leftovers can be enjoyed the traditional street food way: reheated and served in buttered hot dog buns topped with Japanese mayo and pickled ginger.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/04/dining/kc-vegetable-yakisoba/kc-vegetable-yakisoba-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, carrot, mushroom", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1394}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound frozen presteamed yakisoba noodles, thawed", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced", "2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks", "1 large red bell pepper, stemmed, cored and thinly sliced\u00a0", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced", "8 ounces baby kale", "1 cup thinly sliced scallions", "3 tablespoons oyster sauce", "3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1 tablespoon ketchup\u00a0", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the yakisoba: Place yakisoba noodles in a colander and rinse under room-temperature water.
