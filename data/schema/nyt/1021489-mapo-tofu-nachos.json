Instead, you\u2019ll make a creamy, spicy, saucy version using blended silken tofu and all the usual mapo ingredients. Spoon the sauce atop layers of chips, add cheese, then bake it. You could certainly stop there, but finishing with some garnishes makes it especially festive. Save leftover sauce for another round of nachos or a half batch of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021487-mapo-spaghetti\">mapo spaghetti</a>. To double this recipe, bake on a large parchment or foil-lined sheet pan in a 350-degree oven for about 10 minutes. You can also make the sauce with lamb, turkey thigh or a plant-based meat alternative, in place of the ground beef or pork, if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Andrea Nguyen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/07/dining/05mapo3/merlin_177593256_579c59d1-33f5-4b10-86ce-772fd3ee25b4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "appetizer, main course", "keywords": "cheese, doubanjiang, ground beef, ground pork, nacho, scallion, sichuan peppercorns, tofu, tortilla chips", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 324}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14- or 16-ounce) package silken tofu", "1 1/2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola oil", "8 ounces ground beef or pork (preferably 80 or 85 percent lean), roughly chopped to loosen", "2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons doubanjiang (fermented chile bean sauce or paste)", "1 tablespoon douchi (fermented black beans, optional)", "1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "2 teaspoons regular soy sauce", "1 rounded teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more as needed", "Fine sea salt", "1 large scallion, trimmed and sliced on a sharp bias into 2-inch-long pieces", "1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons water", "5 to 6 ounces corn tortilla chips (about 5 cups)", "2 medium scallions, trimmed and sliced on the bias into 3/4-inch-long pieces", "4 ounces shredded Oaxacan, Monterey Jack or other mild-flavored melty cheese (about 1 1/3 cups)", "1/3 cup sliced or coarsely chopped pitted olives, such as black, green or a combination (optional)", "2 whole pickled jalape\u00f1os, sliced (optional)", "1/3 cup coarsely chopped cilantro (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the mapo tofu sauce: If the tofu came as a block in water, discard the water.
