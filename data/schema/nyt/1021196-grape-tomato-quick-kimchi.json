{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grape Tomato \u2018Quick Kimchi\u2019", "description": "This is not a traditional kimchi, but it approximates the flavor profile, bypassing a lengthier fermentation and instead relying on vinegar. In Korea, this dish would be considered a muchim, which can refer to any number of \u201cseasoned\u201d or \u201cdressed\u201d salads or other preparations. Here, thick-skinned grape tomatoes maintain their snappy crunch, even draped in a fire-bright tangle of gochugaru, sesame oil and fish sauce. Though tomato\u2019s natural umami flavor multiplies the longer it sits, this dish is best eaten within 24 hours. When you\u2019re done, don\u2019t throw out the leftover dressing at the bottom of the bowl: Tossed in that tomatoey brine, bouncy rice noodles are a dream. For a vegetarian option, swap out the fish sauce for soy sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/08/dining/02kimchirex3/02kimchirex3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 2 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, pickles, salads and dressings, side dish", "keywords": "fish sauce, garlic, gochugaru, sesame oil, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 381}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound grape tomatoes (about 2 to 3 cups), halved lengthwise", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated garlic", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sesame oil", "1 tablespoon gochugaru", "2 teaspoons fish sauce", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Thinly sliced scallions, chopped chives, or cilantro or flat-leaf parsley leaves for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, toss the tomatoes with the salt, transfer to a colander, and let sit in the sink to drain, about 30 minutes.
