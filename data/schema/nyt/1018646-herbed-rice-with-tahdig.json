{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herbed Rice With Tahdig", "description": "Cooked in two stages, this herbed rice, or sabzi polo, is a constant at the Persian New Year table, where everyone fights over the crust of crisp rice called tahdig. You can use a food processor to chop the herbs if you like. It's key to do the herbs in batches (don't overfill the bowl of the processor), to pulse rather than run and to stop and scrape a few times for even chopping. Work until the pieces are nice and small, about an eighth of an inch or the size of a small sunflower seed, but not so far that they begin to break down and form a paste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/15/dining/15NOWRUZ6/15NOWRUZ6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice", "keywords": "basmati rice, cilantro, dill, greek yogurt, leek, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 360}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 429, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "422 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups basmati rice", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 cups finely diced leeks, including the dark green parts (2 medium leeks or 1 very large leek)", "Fine sea salt or kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 cup finely chopped dill leaves and tender stems (about 2 bunches)", "1 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems (about 2 large bunches)", "3 tablespoons Greek yogurt", "3 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as canola"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place rice in a bowl and rinse with cold water.
