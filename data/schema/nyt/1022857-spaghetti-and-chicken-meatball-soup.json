{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaghetti and Chicken Meatball Soup", "description": "Tomato soup meets spaghetti and meatballs in this one-pot, 30-minute crowd-pleaser. To keep chicken meatballs juicy and light, skip the bread crumbs (which can create dense or bland meatballs) and the browning (which can cause precious juices to evaporate). Instead, plop them into the simmering soup to cook through. Any juices they do release will be captured in the tomato soup, which is creamy from olive oil and Parmesan. Feel free to adapt this recipe to suit your preferences: Add chopped onion, crushed fennel seeds, dried oregano or chopped parsley or basil to the meat or the sauce. The pasta will absorb the soup as it sits, so it\u2019s a dish best eaten right when it\u2019s made.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/12/dining/07chickenrex2-WEB-ONLY/merlin_199513176_78c1ac40-e41f-4888-8144-d406f7596988-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "chicken, marinara sauce, spaghetti", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 547}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground chicken or turkey", "1 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "8 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped", "1 large egg", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional), plus more to taste", "4 cups chicken broth", "3 cups store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015987-classic-marinara-sauce\">homemade</a> marinara sauce", "8 ounces spaghetti, broken roughly into thirds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, stir together the chicken, half the Parmesan, half the garlic, the egg and 1 teaspoon salt.
