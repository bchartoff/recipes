Using all-butter puff pastry gives you the richest flavor; it\u2019s worth seeking out. The smoked salmon makes a sophisticated and pretty topping here, but you can leave it off all or part of the tart if you\u2019ve got vegetarians at the table. Just double up on the capers to compensate for the missing saltiness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/23/dining/18apperex1-tart/18apperex1-tart-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, appetizer", "keywords": "capers, fennel, mascarpone, puff pastry, smoked salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 426}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large fennel bulb (or 2 small ones)", "1 to 2 lemons", "2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, more as needed", "1 cup mascarpone", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, plus more sprigs for garnish", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "All-purpose flour, for dusting the work surface", "1 sheet puff pastry, thawed if frozen (about 14 ounces)", "4 ounces thinly sliced smoked salmon", "2 tablespoons capers, drained and chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the fennel.
