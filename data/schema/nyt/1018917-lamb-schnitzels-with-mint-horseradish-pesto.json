{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Schnitzels With Mint-Horseradish Pesto", "description": "This is a lamb dish done schnitzel-style, devised as a pairing for blaufr\u00e4nkisch wine from Austria. Ask your butcher to pound slices\u00a0of top round of lamb, from the leg, only lightly, which will result in pieces that are about a half-inch thick, providing enough tolerance so the meat can brown without overcooking. Refrigerating the coated slices before frying them helps, too. A pesto sauce, made with mint leaves and zapped with horseradish, picks up some of the herbal and pepper flavors in the wine.\u00a0Warm potato salad in a vinaigrette dressing would be a perfect side dish for the schnitzel.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "austrian", "recipeCategory": "meat", "keywords": "horseradish, mint leaves, sour cream, top round lamb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 6}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1117, "unsaturatedFatContent": "71 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "93 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "804 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup flour", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1/4 cup freshly grated horseradish", "1 large egg", "3/4 cup dry bread crumbs", "1 1/2 pounds top round of lamb, in four pieces lightly pounded to 1/2-inch thick", "1/2 cup (packed) fresh mint leaves", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 lemons", "2 tablespoons sour cream", "2/3 to 1 cup vegetable oil, preferably grape seed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Spread flour on a dinner plate and season with salt, pepper and 2 teaspoons horseradish.
