{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Pudding", "description": "In this country, before there was flan, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, panna cotta, even vanilla pudding, there was rice pudding. Each of those desserts has the same goal: take lots of milk or cream, sweeten it and, through heat and a thickening agent, make it custardy. Flan and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e use eggs, panna cotta uses gelatin and vanilla pudding and similar custards use eggs, cornstarch or flour.\n\nRice pudding is both the most rustic and most elegant of those desserts, using only rice, milk and sugar. It may take some practice, but once you master it, it is among the easiest and most foolproof of desserts. And it is simply amazing how many people drool when they see it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/18/dining/18COOKING-RICEPUDDING/18COOKING-RICEPUDDING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 or more servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, custards and puddings", "keywords": "dessert, milk, rice, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 230}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 297, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "178 milligrams", "sugarContent": "37 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 to 1/3 cup rice", "1/2 cup sugar", "Pinch salt", "4 cups milk", "Pinch saffron, optional", "Cinnamon stick or other flavoring, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees.
