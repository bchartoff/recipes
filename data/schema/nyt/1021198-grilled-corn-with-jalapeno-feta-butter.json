{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Corn With Jalape\u00f1o-Feta Butter", "description": "This dish puts a spicy, cheesy spin on the classic buttered corn-on-the-cob. The ears are charred on the grill, then rubbed with a feta and jalape\u00f1o-flecked butter that melts all over the sweet, blackened kernels. The compound butter is perfectly adaptable. You can substitute other cheeses for the feta, and play around with different kinds of chiles and herbs. Be sure to save any leftover compound butter in the freezer. It\u2019s also terrific sliced on top of grilled or roasted chicken, fish or meats.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/01/dining/01Appetite-Grilled-Corn/01Appetite-Grilled-Corn-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "corn, feta, jalape\u00f1o", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 368}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), softened", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and finely chopped", "1/4 cup crumbled feta", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, basil or dill", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated or mashed to a paste", "1/2 teaspoon fresh lime or lemon juice", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "6 ears corn, shucked", "Olive oil, for grilling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To prepare the jalape\u00f1o-feta butter, in a small bowl, mash together the butter, jalape\u00f1o, feta, cilantro, garlic, lime or lemon juice,\u00a0salt and coriander."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Divide the butter equally onto six pieces of parchment paper large enough to wrap them snugly (6-inch squares should do it), form into logs, and wrap well, twisting the ends like candy wrappers.
