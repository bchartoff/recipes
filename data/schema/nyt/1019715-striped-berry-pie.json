{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Striped Berry Pie", "description": "You can use three jammy berry fillings \u2014 strawberry, raspberry and blackberry \u2014 to create a beautiful, naturally colored ombr\u00e9 effect in a pie. Pre-cooking the fillings helps ensure that they\u2019re thick enough to easily slice once they\u2019re baked. You need to keep a close eye on the fruit here, so don\u2019t be tempted to make more than one filling at a time. Berries can vary in juiciness, so it\u2019s very important to make sure you have the right amount of each filling before assembling the pie (see the Note at the bottom of the recipe for how to adjust your filling if it\u2019s too thin or too thick). The pie is best the day it\u2019s baked, but the fillings can be made up to 2 days ahead; stir well before using.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/11/dining/11Striped-berry-pie/11Striped-berry-pie-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, dessert, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 106}, "recipeIngredient": ["<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019713-perfect-pie-crust\">Perfect Pie Crust,</a> prepared for a fruit pie and chilled", "Egg wash (1 large egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water)", "14 ounces/400 grams blackberries (about 3 cups)", "5 tablespoons/65 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 tablespoons heavy cream", "14 ounces/400 grams raspberries (about 3 cups)", "5 tablespoons/65 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 tablespoons heavy cream", "14 ounces/400 grams stemmed and quartered strawberries (about 3 cups)", "5 tablespoons/65 grams granulated sugar", "2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "4 tablespoons heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a lightly floured surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out a disk of dough into a circle about \u00bc-inch thick.

Take care to fill just to the inner edge of the crust (you may have leftover filling).
