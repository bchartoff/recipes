She took as her motto for the vegetables chapter: \u201cThey can\u2019t eat only raw baby carrots for the rest of their lives.\u201d She believes that reasonably lavish applications of fat (bacon bits, butter, cheese, oil) make vegetables instantly palatable, and she is right. Her default technique is to saut\u00e9 a shallot in butter, turn the vegetables in the pan until they start to soften, then cover tightly and let them cook in their own steam, testing them often. Here, a colorful medley of fresh corn, bell pepper, and kale are saut\u00e9ed with bacon fat, butter and shallots, then tossed with bacon bits and scallions. It's endlessly versatile \u2013 substitute carrots or summer squash for peppers, onions for shallots, spinach for kale \u2013 and could very well win over the pickiest of eaters.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/18/dining/18JPVEGETABLES3_SPAN/18JPVEGETABLES3_SPAN-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weeknight", "keywords": "bacon, corn, greens, gluten-free, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 377}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 315, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "527 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 shallot or small onion, minced", "3 cups corn kernels, from about 4 ears corn (or a combination of corn and diced summer squash)", "1/2 cup chopped red or orange bell pepper (or carrot)", "Pinch red pepper flakes", "Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 or 3  scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced", "4  to 6 cups shredded, de-stemmed greens, like chard or kale (or whole baby spinach, or another tender green)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-low heat, turning occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes.
