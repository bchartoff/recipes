Turning rafts of okra (versus flipping individual pods) is the easiest way to grill them. Besides the charred smoky flavor grilling imparts to all vegetables, it also minimizes okra\u2019s slime factor \u2014 boiled or stewed okra tends to become mucilaginous. This is useful for thickening gumbo, but it\u2019s off-putting to many people who try to eat okra straight. In keeping with okra\u2019s Louisianan associations, this formula calls for dusting the okra with Cajun seasoning before grilling and serving it with a r\u00e9moulade sauce for dipping or spooning on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/16/dining/15vegetablesrex2-grilled-okra2/merlin_189245337_71f803c4-dcef-498e-90b0-6525b4f4f486-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "creole mustard, horseradish, mayonnaise, okra", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 67}, "recipeIngredient": ["Vegetable oil, for the grill grates", "1 pound okra (small pods are the most tender)", "3 tablespoons melted butter or extra-virgin olive oil", "Cajun or Creole seasoning or blackening spice mixture, for sprinkling", "3/4 cup mayonnaise", "3 tablespoons Creole or Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon prepared horseradish", "1 tablespoon pickle juice (optional)", "1 teaspoon Tabasco or other Louisiana-style hot sauce, or to taste", "1 teaspoon piment\u00f3n (smoked paprika)", "1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set up your grill for direct grilling and heat your grill to high (450 to 600 degrees).
