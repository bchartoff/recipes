The author Gail Monaghan had visited the Comtesse Cristina de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 at her French chateau, where, on New Year\u2019s Eve, a decadent confection of ice cream, whipped cream, white nougat, meringue and chocolate shavings was served. The countess described the recipe to Monaghan, who set about recreating it in New York. Two years later, she e-mailed her hostess to make sure she had the recipe right. The countess, however, had no recollection whatsoever of \u201cthis special cake.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Christine Muhlke"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/21/dining/Fane/Fane-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "Serves 10 to 12", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, side dish", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 721, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "sodiumContent": "153 milligrams", "sugarContent": "39 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large egg whites, at room temperature", "Pinch of salt", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "3/4 cup plus 5 tablespoons superfine sugar", "Cooking-oil spray", "3 pints vanilla ice cream, softened", "5 cups heavy cream, chilled", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla", "12 ounces hard white nougat, crushed into small pieces", "3/4 cup (about 3 ounces) shaved bittersweet chocolate"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before, prepare the meringue: preheat oven to 200 degrees.
