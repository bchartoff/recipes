{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Leeks Vinaigrette", "description": "For leeks vinaigrette, look for smallish leeks, which are more tender and more closely resemble asparagus spears, for the French call this dish \u201casperges du pauvre,\u201d the poor man\u2019s asparagus. \n\nThis is important; a crunchy leek is unpleasant. Drain the leeks and hold at room temperature for up to several hours, but do not refrigerate or they\u2019ll lose their delicate texture.\n\nTo serve, simply smear the leeks with vinaigrette; I make a thick, sharp rather mustardy one to complement the sweetness of the leeks. Then garnish as you wish. I like capers, hard-cooked egg, olives and cornichons.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/leeksvinaigrette/leeksvinaigrette-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "quick, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "eggs, leek, ni\u00e7oise olives, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 130}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 173, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "474 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 small leeks, about 1 pound", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons capers", "8 to 12 cornichons", "12 olives, such as ni\u00e7oise, oil-cured black or green picholine", "2 hard-cooked eggs, halved lengthwise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim leeks, removing tough outer layers and cutting off root ends.
