Optional mustard seeds add pungent flavor and pair well with lemon juice, ginger and the smoldering heat of dried round red chiles. Use any kind of white fish you like and add more onion for more sweetness. Serve this bright and punchy dish with rice or roti, or by itself. For a saucier dish that\u2019s more like a curry, stir in a half cup of water, fish stock or coconut milk after Step 2 and bring to a simmer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zainab Shah"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/15/dining/zs-khara-fish-masala/merlin_201335403_96c69d64-54f2-462f-9013-61bf576ee712-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "mustard seed, red chili, tomatoes, white fish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 494}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons ghee or neutral oil", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds (optional)", "1 teaspoon black mustard seeds (optional)", "6 dried whole round red chiles, preferably Dundicut", "1 medium Spanish onion, or white, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon garam masala", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon kashmiri red chile powder", "4 medium plum tomatoes, chopped", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/2 pounds firm, skinless white fish, such as cod or haddock, cut into 3-inch pieces", "Juice of 1 medium lemon, about \u00bc cup", "2 chopped Thai green chiles", "1 (2-inch) piece of ginger, peeled and julienned", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat ghee in a medium pot over medium until it melts, 30 to 45 seconds.
