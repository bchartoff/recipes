{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Paillard With Curried Oyster Mushrooms", "description": "Alain Sailhac, dean emeritus of the French Culinary Institute in New York and one of New York\u2019s most venerable French chefs, gives inspiration here to recapture the glory of the chicken breast, that popular yet generally overcooked piece of meat. He suggests cutting the breast in half horizontally to make two thin pieces, then topping them with quick-cooking vegetables like mushrooms, zucchini or tomatoes, and roasting everything together. This supremely juicy and complexly flavored dish uses that technique and is a snap to put together.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/Chicken-Paillard/Chicken-Paillard-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "chicken, mushroom, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 295}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 160, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "405 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for greasing pan and for drizzling", "2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, (8 ounces each)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon curry powder, more to taste", "7 ounces oyster mushrooms, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons fresh chopped basil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 scallions, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
