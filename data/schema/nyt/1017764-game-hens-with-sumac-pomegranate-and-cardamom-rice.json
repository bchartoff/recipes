{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Game Hens With Sumac, Pomegranate and Cardamom Rice", "description": "There\u2019s very little difference these days between the small chickens marketed as game hens and the ones called poussins. Both names are used, and they refer to a bird that weighs about 1 pound. And both birds work here in this recipe. The hens are beautifully burnished and seasoned with sumac and pomegranate molasses, which adds a tart sweet and sour flavor. (You can find the molasses at Middle Eastern groceries.) Figure one whole bird per person, or half a bird for smaller appetites. Fragrant cardamom-spiced basmati rice makes a perfect accompaniment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/28/dining/28KITCH_WEB/28KITCH_WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "game hens, pomegranate molasses, sumac, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 75}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 976, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "58 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "946 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 game hens or poussins, about 1 pound each", "Salt", "2 teaspoons sumac", "\u00bd teaspoon cinnamon", "\u00bd teaspoon black pepper", "2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses", "2 cups basmati rice, rinsed", "8 cardamom pods", "8 cloves", "2 tablespoons butter", "\u00bc cup currants", "\u00bd cup golden raisins", "\u00bc cup pomegranate seeds", "3 tablespoons lightly toasted pine nuts", "Mint sprigs or chopped mint, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
