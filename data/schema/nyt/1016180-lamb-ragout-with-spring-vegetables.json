{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Ragout With Spring Vegetables", "description": "To celebrate the end of winter, French cooks make navarin printanier, a lamb stew. Instead of serving it with potatoes, parsnips or other winter root vegetables, this colorful stew is brimming with fresh spring produce, a mixture of small vegetables like baby turnips, fava beans and scallions. To keep it on the lighter side, use a splash of white wine instead of red. Finish with peas or asparagus tips, cooked briefly, if they are available. The stew can be made a day ahead, but the vegetables should be freshly cooked before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/02KITCH_SPAN/02KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 102}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1063, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "70 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "60 grams", "fiberContent": "17 grams", "proteinContent": "57 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "2114 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds lamb shoulder, trimmed of exterior fat, cut in 2-inch chunks", "Salt and pepper", "2 teaspoons fennel seed, crushed in a mortar or spice mill", "2 tablespoons olive oil, more as needed", "2 medium onions, diced, about 2 cups", "4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "1 bay leaf", "A few sprigs fresh thyme", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 cup white wine", "4 cups chicken or vegetable broth", "3 pounds fava beans in the pod, or use 1 1/2 cups frozen baby lima beans or edamame, defrosted ", "1 medium fennel bulb, trimmed and cut into 1-inch squares (reserve the fronds for garnish)", "1/2 pound baby carrots, about 12, trimmed and peeled", "2 pounds baby turnips, trimmed and halved or quartered", "2 tablespoons butter", "1 bunch scallions, cut in 2-inch lengths", "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "2 tablespoons parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season lamb chunks generously with salt and pepper.
