{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "5-Minute Hummus", "description": "How do you improve on something that\u2019s already pretty beloved? For starters, you could make it accessible without sacrificing quality. Michael Solomonov and Steven Cook of the Philadelphia restaurant Zahav found success with their hummus recipe, but in their second book, \u201cIsraeli Soul,\u201d the two came up with this smart improvement, done in a fraction of the time of the original. It\u2019s just as satisfying, and packed with tahini flavor, a given since it calls for a whole 16-ounce jar. (Another advantage? No leftover tahini languishing in the back of your fridge for months.) The end result is nutty and smooth, and topped with roasted vegetables, a worthy weeknight meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Krysten Chambrot"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/dining/03Cookbooks4-copy/merlin_144070329_05e7a607-69e8-4a4b-b851-0a866ba3aae8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 generous cups", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, weekday, beans, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, chickpea, tahini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 919}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 977, "unsaturatedFatContent": "53 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "74 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "67 grams", "fiberContent": "25 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "966 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 garlic clove", "Juice of 1 lemon, about 1/4 cup", "1 (16-ounce) jar tahini", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 to 1 1/2 cups ice water", "2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drop the 1/4 garlic clove into a food processor and add the\u00a0lemon juice.
