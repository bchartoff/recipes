{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Japanese Curry Chicken and Rice", "description": "Usually milder and sweeter than Indian curries, classic Japanese curry is a thick beef-and-vegetable stew served over rice. This recipe is not a traditional one, but rather an easy weeknight version, a one-pot meal featuring juicy chicken thighs, vegetables and rice. Instead of relying on store-bought or homemade instant curry roux, this dish relies on a few spices to mimic traditional Japanese curry flavors. Curry powder, ground nutmeg and Worcestershire sauce are combined and bloomed in butter to create the round and rich sauce. Onions, potatoes and carrots create the bulk of traditional Japanese curry, but sweet potatoes, cauliflower and peas would be great substitutions or additions. Serve the meal with any type of pickle you have on hand for a vinegary hit to contrast the rich curry.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/17/dining/kc-japanese-curry-chicken/kc-japanese-curry-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, poultry, main course", "keywords": "carrot, chicken thigh, curry powder, dutch oven, rice, russet potatoes", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5277}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 large thighs)", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup finely chopped white or yellow onion", "3 tablespoons Madras curry powder", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 1/2 cups short-grain white rice, rinsed until water runs clear", "1 large baking potato (about 1 pound), such as russets, white or Idaho, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 1 1/2 cups)", "3 medium carrots, sliced 1/2-inch-thick (1 1/2 cups)", "3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "Chopped scallions, pickles, kimchi and/or hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
