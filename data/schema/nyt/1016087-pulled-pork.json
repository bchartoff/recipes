{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pulled Pork", "description": "The chef and barbecue madman Chris Schlesinger sold the East Coast Grill, his restaurant in Cambridge, Mass., in 2012. But his recipe for pulled pork, which adorned the restaurant\u2019s menu from its opening in 1985, lives on in this excellent version he gave to The Times in 2003: a tangle of soft, vinegar-scented pork that pairs extremely well with coleslaw on top of a cheap hamburger bun. Cooking the dish can be an all-day or an all-night affair, the meat luxuriating in a bath of hardwood smoke, but it is hardly taxing for anyone with a kettle grill and 12 hours on hand. \u201cBarbecue is such a typical guy thing to do,\u201d Schlesinger said at the time. \u201cMuch ado about nothing.\u201d But the results put the lie to the time spent spacing out, watching the smoke curl up into the sky. Schlesinger agreed. \u201cIt is intense,\u201d he said.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20HIT_PORK/20HIT_PORK-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT14H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, editors' pick, project", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, pork", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 505}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 331, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "509 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons paprika", "4 tablespoons brown sugar", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "2 tablespoons cracked black pepper", "2 tablespoons ground cumin", "2 tablespoons chili powder", "2 tablespoons dry mustard", "2 tablespoons ground coriander", "1 tablespoon cayenne pepper", "1 pork butt, 5 to 6 pounds", "Barbecue sauce <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1016086/barbecue-sauce.html\">(see recipe)</a>"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a grill with a cover, build a small fire to one side, making sure all the wood or charcoal becomes engulfed in flame.
