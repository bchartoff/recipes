{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dirty Chai Earthquake Cookies", "description": "In case you\u2019re wondering about the name of this cakey, chewy-edged cookie, which nearly explodes through its sugary crust, it\u2019s a nod to a coffee bar creation in which a shot of espresso tops off a cup of masala chai, the Indian spiced tea. It\u2019s right at home on a traditional holiday cookie plate, thanks to its festive cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and cloves. Feel free to add a little freshly grated nutmeg, if you\u2019re so inclined. A strong coffee flavor adds nuance; black pepper lends a spicy kick; and malted milk powder, browned butter and brown sugar all contribute toasty warm notes to this craveable treat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/ss-earthquake-cookies/ss-earthquake-cookies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "brown sugar, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coffee, espresso coffee powder, ginger, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 780}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon finely ground espresso (not instant espresso) or finely ground coffee", "1/2 cup/115 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick)", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons malted milk powder, such as Carnation brand", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon finely ground black pepper", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup/165 grams light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract or paste", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar, for rolling", "1/2 cup/50 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted, for rolling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put espresso or coffee in a small metal bowl.
