{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Corned Beef and Cabbage", "description": "Corned beef is really just brisket that\u2019s been cured in salt and spices. Historically, this was done for preservation, but the method of \u201ccorning\u201d has remained because it transforms the meat into a bold, aromatic and salty treat. You can <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018642-homemade-corned-beef\">corn your own brisket</a> if you have a week to spare, or you can buy one that\u2019s brined but uncooked, which is what is used here. Each one comes with a little sachet of pickling spices, usually coriander and mustard seeds, allspice and crumbled bay leaf. Make sure to fish it out of the package and save it, because those spices perfume the beef as it braises. Get a corned beef made from flat-cut brisket, if you can, as it will be easier to slice into neat, uniform slabs. (The point cut has more striations of fat and may fall apart when sliced.) Serve this satisfying one-pot meal with mustard and beer.
