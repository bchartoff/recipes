{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb Upside-Down Cake", "description": "Take advantage of rhubarb season with this easy dessert. Baked and unmolded, this cake resembles a pale pink mosaic atop velvet-crumbed and vanilla-infused cake. The rhubarb, which you\u2019ll add in raw, is tangy and tender, firm enough to give you something to chew over. It\u2019s an easy half-hour of prep and another hour and change in the oven, ample time for a light supper, anticipation of dessert hanging in the spring air.
