{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Brussels Sprouts Pasta With Toasted Chickpeas", "description": "This fast and satisfying vegetarian weeknight pasta packs in a whole pound of brussels sprouts. The mountain of shredded sprouts may seem like a lot, but like spinach, it will cook down. As the sprouts soften, they caramelize and naturally sweeten, losing any hints of bitterness. Chickpeas are toasted in olive oil until deep golden brown, crispy in spots and super toasty. They bring a nutty, earthy flavor to the dish, complementing the tangy capers and lemony sauce. Leftovers are tasty enjoyed cold like pasta salad, added to a frittata, or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil until golden and topped with a fried egg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/dining/kc-brussels-sprouts-pasta/merlin_178199862_edaaba28-6613-4d5c-b5e3-c11d03e2f2b6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, beans, noodles, pastas, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, capers, chickpea, parmesan, pasta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1697}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and patted dry", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed and very thinly sliced (about 5 tightly packed cups)", "8 ounces dried tagliatelle pasta", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 1 1/2 ounces), plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/4 cup chopped fresh chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a pot of salted water to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven or a large, deep skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium.
