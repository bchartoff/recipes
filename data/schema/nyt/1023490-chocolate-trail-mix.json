{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Trail Mix", "description": "Anyone who has experienced the accidental melting of chocolate trail mix during hot weather has also likely enjoyed the blissful moment when it solidifies again, leaving it in a different form: one composed of sweet, salty and crunchy clusters, with an eggshell-thin chocolate coating. This simple and adaptable recipe \u2014 which includes a tip for achieving the melted version \u2014 is one that you can enjoy during long hikes, after hard workouts or simply to snack on with beer or cocktails. While trail mix is often raw, this version lightly toasts the nuts and seeds, which imparts extra flavor. Finishing with flaky sea salt is a nice touch, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/22/dining/yf-trail-mix/merlin_213556047_bbe430e9-d84d-4a51-a01e-0c6c3dad9ce9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "About 4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack", "keywords": "almond, cashew, dark chocolate, dried cherry, dried fruit, make-ahead, pecan, pistachio, pumpkin seed, semisweet chocolate chip, sunflower seeds, halloween, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup raw, unsalted almonds or pistachios", "1 cup raw, unsalted cashews or pecans", "1/2 cup raw, unsalted pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds", "1/2 cup dried cherries, raisins, blueberries, goldenberries or chopped dried apricots, mango, pineapple or prunes", "Salt", "1/2 cup dark or semisweet chocolate pieces or chips, peanut butter cups or chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 275 degrees.
