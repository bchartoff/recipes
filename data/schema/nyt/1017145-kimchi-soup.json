{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi Soup", "description": "In Korean cuisine, kimchi is not only a condiment or pickle; it is also used as an ingredient in many cooked dishes. Kimchi soup, called Jjigae, is a satisfying example. The fermented kimchi vegetables quickly provide deep flavor to the broth, so the soup can be produced in little more than half an hour. Aged kimchi, which is more intensely sour, is the preferred type to use. Surprisingly mellow, the soup is neither too spicy nor too salty.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/21/dining/21JPKITCHEN4/21JPKITCHEN4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "gochujang, kimchi, pork belly, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 496}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 385, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "707 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh pork belly, cut in 1/2-inch pieces", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "1 teaspoon fish sauce", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 medium onion, chopped", "2 cups kimchi, aged if possible, squeezed dry and chopped", "3 tablespoons Korean red pepper paste (gochujang)", "1 tablespoon Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)", "1 cup kimchi juice", "8 cups water (for a richer soup, use chicken, pork or beef broth)", "8 ounces soft or silken tofu, cut in large cubes", "8 scallions or Korean chives, chopped, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put pork belly in a bowl.
