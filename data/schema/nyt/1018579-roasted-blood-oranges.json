{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Blood Oranges", "description": "These caramelized oranges take a little planning: You'll need to leave time for the crystallized mint leaves to dry and harden, and for the orange slices to chill and then cool after they have been caramelized. The result is a dessert that can be made a few hours in advance. The recipe can also be doubled. You can substitute plain mint leaves for the sugared ones. The best way to caramelize the oranges is with a torch. If you plan to run them under the broiler, use a baking sheet with sides because the oranges will give up some sweet juices, which you will want to capture to drizzle around the slices for serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/15/dining/15BLOOD/15BLOOD-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "blood orange, mint leaves, mint oil, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 8}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 261, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "10 milligrams", "sugarContent": "60 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 fresh mint leaves", "1 egg white, lightly beaten, optional", "1/4 cup granulated sugar, optional", "4 blood oranges", "1/2 cup Demerara (granulated light brown) sugar", "A few drops of mint oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If crystallizing the mint leaves, place them on a sheet of parchment paper.
