One, the acidity in the marinade helps tenderize the meat, and two, the sugars in the yogurt help brown and caramelize the skin of the chicken as it roasts. Be sure to toss the chickpeas occasionally as they roast to encourage them to get coated in the chicken fat as it renders.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/ar-sheetpan-chicken-with-chickpeas/ar-sheetpan-chicken-with-chickpeas-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, chickpea, fennel seeds, lemon, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3138}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1108, "unsaturatedFatContent": "36 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "62 grams", "fiberContent": "16 grams", "proteinContent": "78 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1896 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 1/2 to 4 pound) chicken, cut into parts (alternatively, 3 to 3 1/2 pounds of bone-in, skin-on chicken parts, such as breasts, thighs and legs)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 1/2 cups full-fat Greek yogurt, divided", "5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided", "2 teaspoons ground turmeric, divided", "2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1 tablespoon fennel seed", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 large red onion, thinly sliced, divided", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 cup mint or cilantro leaves, torn"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken parts with salt and pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine 3/4 cup yogurt, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 teaspoon turmeric and 2 tablespoons water in a large bowl.
