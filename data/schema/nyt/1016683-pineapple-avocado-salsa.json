It goes great with salmon or just about any other fish. This is a sweet, fruity salsa, with a wonderful array of textures: juicy, sweet-acidic pineapple; soft, creamy and subtle avocado; and crisp and refreshing jicama, with everything set off by the heat of the chiles. The avocado gives a pale green cast to the mix. It looks beautiful with salmon and goes with just about any other fish, as well as with chicken or even fajitas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/29/science/31recipehealth/31recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low calorie, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 31}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 120, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "406 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 ripe pineapple, peeled, cored and finely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "1 medium or 1/2 large avocado, cut in small dice (about 1/2 cup)", "1/2 medium jicama, cut in small dice (about 1 cup)", "1 to 2 jalape\u00f1o or serrano chiles, to taste (or more, to taste)", "Salt to taste", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and gently toss together, taking care not to mash the avocado.
