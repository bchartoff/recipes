{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Asparagus and Chicken Salad With Ginger Dressing", "description": "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013972-roasted-asparagus\">Asparagus</a> takes easily to many kinds of seasonings, so after you\u2019ve tired of having it plain with butter or homemade <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12459-mayonnaise\">mayonnaise</a>, try this spicy dressing laced with ginger and chiles. Adding smoked chicken is a nice way to make a more substantial first course or light lunch. You can purchase smoked chicken at better butcher shops or online, but equally good is grilled chicken at room temperature, or cold poached chicken. I sometimes substitute lightly smoked ham or smoked slab bacon, simmered until tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/27/dining/27KITCHEN1/27KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "asparagus, smoked chicken, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 480}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 502, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "698 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large shallot, finely diced, about 2 tablespoons", "3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "Salt to taste", "Generous pinch of cayenne", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1 pound asparagus", "Salt and pepper", "1 serrano chile, thinly sliced (optional)", "1/2 cup roasted peanuts, crushed", "3/4 pound smoked chicken, sliced", "1 large lime, halved", "Basil, mint and cilantro leaves, about 1/2 cup total"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the vinaigrette, put shallots in a small bowl.
