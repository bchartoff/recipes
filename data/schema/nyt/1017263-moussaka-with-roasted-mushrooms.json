{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Moussaka With Roasted Mushrooms", "description": "In this Balkan style Moussaka I have substituted the <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017259-roasted-mushroom-base\">roasted mushroom mix</a> for half the meat. But you can also make a vegetarian version with no meat at all. It is delicious either way, with a complex, slightly sweet Eastern Mediterranean sauce spiced with a little cinnamon, a pinch of allspice and a few cloves. Greek moussaka is topped with b\u00e9chamel, which can be heavy, even gummy. But this one has a light, fluffy topping made with yogurt and eggs. There are a few steps involved here and the sauce is a long-cooking one, but you can get that started while the eggplant is roasting in the oven to speed things along or make the sauce the day before.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/04/science/recipehealthmoussaka/recipehealthmoussaka-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 generously", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 300}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 2 1/2 pounds (3 medium or 2 large) eggplant", "Salt", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 pound minced or ground lamb or lean beef", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 medium onions, finely chopped", "2 to 4 large garlic cloves, minced (to taste)", "1/2 pound <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017259-roasted-mushroom-base\">roasted mushroom mix</a>, or for a vegetarian version 1 pound", "2 pounds tomatoes, peeled and chopped, with juice, or 1 28-ounce can, pulsed in a food processor with juice", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/4 rounded teaspoon ground cinnamon", "3 cloves, ground", "Pinch of allspice (2 or 3 berries), ground", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1 bay leaf", "1/2 to 1 cup hot water", "Salt to taste", "freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1 egg, beaten", "4 eggs, beaten", "1 1/4 cups plain Greek yogurt", "pinch of  Salt", "pinch of  pepper", "pinch of paprika", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, kefalotyri or kashkaval cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees with racks positioned in the middle and lower third.
