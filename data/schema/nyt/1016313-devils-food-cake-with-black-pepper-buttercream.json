{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Devil\u2019s Food Cake With Black Pepper Buttercream", "description": "Like all the best devil\u2019s food cakes, this six-layer beauty has a deeply fudgy flavor and a light and feathery texture. In between the tender cake layers, a black pepper and vanilla buttercream creates a soft and creamy contrast to the dense fudge frosting on the top and sides. With six layers and two frostings, this cake is definitely a project, but one well worth making if you want to impress. And you can make it in stages. The frostings can be made up to a week ahead and stored in the refrigerator. Bring them to room temperature and briefly beat with an electric mixer before assembling the cake. The cake layers themselves can be baked a day ahead. Store them, well-wrapped, at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/30/multimedia/clark-devils-food-cake/clark-devils-food-cake-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "butter, chocolate, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 366}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 tablespoons/140 grams unsalted butter, softened, more for greasing pans", "2/3 cup/70 grams unsweetened natural (not Dutch-processed) cocoa powder, more for pans", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters whole milk", "2 cups/200 grams cake flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons/10 grams baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams kosher salt, more as needed", "1 3/4 cups/350 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters vanilla extract", "5 large egg whites", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "Large pinch kosher salt", "3 sticks plus 2 tablespoons/365 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1 vanilla bean pod, split lengthwise, seeds scraped", "1 teaspoon/5 grams coarsely ground black pepper", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "Pinch kosher salt", "6 ounces/170 grams unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped", "8 tablespoons/112 grams unsalted butter, diced", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
