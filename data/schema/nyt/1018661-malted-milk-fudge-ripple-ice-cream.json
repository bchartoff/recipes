{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Malted Milk Fudge Ripple Ice Cream", "description": "If you love the flavor of malted milk, you\u2019ll adore this ultra-creamy ice cream, which tastes like a chocolate malted in solid form. To achieve the most intense flavor, seek out the barley malt syrup (available in health food stores), which deepens the malted milk powder whisked into the ice cream base. Be gentle when folding in the fudge ripple; you want the fudge to stay in distinct pockets and not disappear into the ice cream base. Or skip the rippling altogether and serve the fudge as a sauce on top of the ice cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/22/dining/22APPE2/22APPE2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H35M", "recipeYield": "1 1/2 quarts ice cream", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "barley malt syrup, dutch-process cocoa powder, heavy cream, malted-milk powder, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 88}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/590 milliliters heavy cream", "2/3 cup/90 grams malted milk powder", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/100 grams light brown sugar", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters barley malt syrup (optional)", "Pinch salt", "6 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup/100 grams sugar", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters barley malt syrup (or substitute light or dark corn syrup)", "6 tablespoons/50 grams unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder", "Pinch salt", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "Crushed malted milk balls or more malted milk powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups/470 milliliters heavy cream, the malt powder and the vanilla.
