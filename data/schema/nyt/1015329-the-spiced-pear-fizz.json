You can\u2019t turn your living room into a bar, nor can you please everybody, but you can gain massive points by making the bold move: choose one great cocktail and declare: \u201cThis is what we\u2019re drinking tonight.\u201d This Spiced Pear Fizz is a great choice for the holidays. Mull some wintry spices overnight in the simple syrup, and from there fashion this delicious concoction. Top  it with a good-quality prosecco or a nonvintage brut Champagne for a spot-on seasonal drink.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Toby Cecchini"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/24/dining/The-Spiced-Pear-Fizz/The-Spiced-Pear-Fizz-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy", "keywords": "pear brandy, simple syrup", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 81, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "7 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces Harvest Spirits Hudson Valley Pear Brandy or other dry, eau-de-vie-style Poire William", "1 ounce fresh lemon juice", "3/4 ounce spicy simple syrup (see <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1015330/spicy-simple-syrup.html'>recipe</a>)."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the ingredients with ice in a cocktail shaker, shake and strain into a Champagne flute, filling it roughly halfway.
