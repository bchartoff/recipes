It\u2019s usually on the table in pizzerias for drizzling, but it\u2019s also terrific drizzled over vegetables, grilled meats or fish, grains and bread \u2013 whatever you want to add a kick to. In France it is made with very hot bird chilies. You could use fresh Thai chilies for this, but I\u2019m using dried chiles de arbol, because that\u2019s what I have on hand and it makes an oil that will last for months.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/06/science/07recipehealth/07recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 to 1.25 cups oil", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "dried chili peppers, olive oil, healthy, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1060, "unsaturatedFatContent": "91 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "109 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "25 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons dried oregano", "2 bay leaves, crumbled", "1 teaspoon fennel seeds (optional)", "4 sprigs fresh thyme", "2 sprigs fresh rosemary (optional)", "12 whole small dried red chili peppers or Japanese chilies, or about 8 chiles de arbol, broken in half, or 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes", "1 to 1 1/4 cups olive oil (does not need to be extra virgin), or a combination of olive oil and grapeseed oil, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the herbs, chiles and oil in a medium saucepan and heat slowly over low heat until they begin to sizzle.
