{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bamboo Shot", "description": "The Bamboo Shot takes the famous 19-century sherry cocktail and turns it into a shot. The original Bamboo \u2014 sherry, dry vermouth and a few drops of orange and Angostura bitters \u2014 is credited to the German bartender Louis Eppinger of the Grand Hotel in Yokohama, Japan. Dry and complex, it looks and tastes like a high-proof drink, but the low-A.B.V. ingredients keep its impact in check, making it an ideal shot to start a celebration \u2014 or a Tuesday night. Eating briny, buttery Castelvetrano olives as a chaser completes the shot experience \u2014 and helps round out the drink\u2019s drier tones.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/30/dining/28shotsrex1/merlin_181421787_f58d9c7d-2049-4eae-99d9-4bc08fb1a24e-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "8 shots", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bitters, lemon, orange, sherry, vermouth, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 106}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 ounces fino or manzanilla sherry", "3 1/2 ounces dry or bianco vermouth", "3 dashes Angostura bitters", "3 dashes orange bitters", "2 orange peels", "2 lemon peels", "Very small pinch of flaky sea salt (optional)", "Ice", "Big green olives, such as Castelvetrano, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To a cocktail shaker or mixing glass, add the sherry, vermouth and bitters."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Hold one of the lemon peels by its long edges, skin facing down into the cocktail shaker.
