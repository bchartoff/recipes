{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Keema (Spiced Ground Meat)", "description": "Though elite, upper-caste Hindus tend to be vegetarian, most Indians eat meat, and many millions of Muslim Indians eat beef. This saucy keema, which can be made with chicken, lamb, beef or a combination of meat, is simple, comforting home cooking \u2014 the meat stretched out and made luxurious in a reduction of spiced tomato. It can be dinner with a couple of soft, shiny bread rolls, or a chapati and a dollop of yogurt. A friend of mine even mixes it with spaghetti and a moderate squirt of ketchup. (Don\u2019t judge!) The secret to this version is to take your time: Caramelize the onions properly for a strong foundation, and once you\u2019ve added the beef, simmer it patiently until the sauce is dark and silky, and the fat has split away, risen to the top, and pooled in every nook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/11/dining/09Indianrex8/merlin_169211679_a43f2138-14d3-4721-9e66-2477e53dbcb0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "meat", "keywords": "cilantro, garam masala, ginger, ground beef, red onion, tomato, dairy-free, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 290}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1 red onion, sliced", "4 garlic cloves", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled", "1 green finger chile (or serrano chile), stem removed", "6 Roma tomatoes, quartered", "1 pound ground beef (preferably at least 15 percent fat)", "1/2 teaspoon chile powder, such as cayenne", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1/2 cup fresh mint leaves", "1/2 teaspoon garam masala"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium.
