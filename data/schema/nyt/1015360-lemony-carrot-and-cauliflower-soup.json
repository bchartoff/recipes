You can pretty much simmer together any combination of vegetables with a little water or broth, pur\u00e9e it, top it with good olive oil and salt, and end up with something good to eat. The addition of miso paste and crushed coriander to the broth, and fresh lemon and cilantro at the end, zips things up without negating the comfort factor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/04/dining/04dinner/04dinner-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, carrot, cauliflower", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3170}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 189, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "787 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for serving", "1 large white onion, peeled and diced (2 cups)", "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped", "5 medium carrots (1 pound), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (2 cups)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "3 tablespoons white miso", "1 small (or half of a large) head cauliflower, trimmed and cut into florets", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, more to taste", "Smoky chile powder, for serving", "Coarse sea salt, for serving", "Cilantro leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, dry pot over medium heat, toast coriander seeds until fragrant and dark golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
