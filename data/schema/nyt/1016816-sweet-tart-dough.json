{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Tart Dough", "description": "This formula for p\u00e2te sucr\u00e9e comes from the pastry chef Jacquy Pfeiffer, with whom I wrote a book. It may surprise you that everything, even the butter, is at room temperature when you mix the dough. Room temperature butter will mix together thoroughly and quickly with the other ingredients, so you won\u2019t find chunks of it when you roll out the dough. It also allows you to mix the dough quickly, minimizing air bubbles and the development of the gluten in the flour, which would result in too much elasticity in the dough, causing it to shrink during baking. He uses powdered sugar, rather than granulated, because it melts and combines quickly with other ingredients, again allowing you to mix the dough quickly. Almond flour contributes flavor to the dough and gives it a nice texture, but you could substitute regular flour if you have a hard time finding almond flour. Finally, he uses cake flour because it has a lower gluten content than all-purpose flour.\n\nOnce you mix the dough it requires a long rest in the refrigerator \u2014 preferably overnight \u2014 so that the gluten developed during mixing can relax and the starch in the flour can absorb liquid. It should remain cold when you roll it out, and ideally you should give it another overnight rest in the fridge, uncovered, once it is rolled out, so that the pastry dries out even more. If you don\u2019t have the extra day, give it at least an hour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/24/dining/24DESSERT2/24DESSERT2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Two 9-inch pastry shells", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, pastries, pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, tart dough", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 47}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons/6 ounces/168 grams unsalted French-style butter (82 percent fat), at room temperature, plus a very small amount for pans", "1/4 teaspoon/1 gram fine sea salt", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon/112 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/39 grams skinless almond flour, sifted", "1 1/2 teaspoons/7 milliliters vanilla extract", "1 extra-large egg, beaten, plus 1 to 2 teaspoons beaten egg/63 grams beaten egg", "2 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon/315 grams cake flour, sifted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and salt on medium speed for 1 minute.
