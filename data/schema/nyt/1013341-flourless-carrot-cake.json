{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Flourless Carrot Cake", "description": "This crunchy, spicy carrot cake is much lighter and less cloying than most I\u2019ve tasted. It\u2019s important to grate the carrots on the fine holes of your grater, or else they\u2019ll remain too crunchy. For best results, wrap the cake tightly in plastic after it cools and serve it the next day. It will keep for five days in the refrigerator if wrapped airtight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/10/science/11recipehealth/11recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "almond, carrot, dessert, gluten-free, healthy, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 584}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 184, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "110 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups (1/2 pound) unsalted toasted almonds", "1/4 cup raw brown (turbinado) sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "2 teaspoons grated lemon zest", "4 large eggs", "1/3 cup organic white sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups finely grated carrots (about 10 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees with a rack in the middle.
