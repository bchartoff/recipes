{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Yucatan Shrimp", "description": "This is a dinner to evoke deep summer, when the heat lies heavy even at dusk and humidity wraps you like a blanket: shrimp tossed in garlic butter made fiery with Indonesian sambal and jalape\u00f1o, cut by lime, fragrant with cilantro. It is a kind of scampi for the sun-kissed and sun-desirous alike, a vacation on a plate. Add a mojito and a couple of beers. The recipe comes out of southwest Florida, from Doc Ford\u2019s Sanibel Rum Bar and Grille, a restaurant that sits off the road that runs slow and sultry along Sanibel Island toward Captiva, past the placid, russet waters of Tarpon Bay. Randy Wayne White, one of the owners, named the place after the fictional protagonist of his mystery novels. The air smells of salt and mangrove there, of tropical rot and fresh-cut grass. He graciously sent along a recipe, which we adapted for use at home, in 2010.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/Yucatan-Shrimp/Yucatan-Shrimp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, gluten-free, lime juice, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 768}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 199, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "687 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large clove garlic, minced", "Juice of two large limes", "1 tablespoon Indonesian sambal (preferably sambal oelek, by Huy Fong, though sriracha will work as well)", "Kosher salt", "freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 pound large, fresh, shell-on shrimp", "1 teaspoon jalape\u00f1o, seeded and chopped (optional)", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan set over low heat, melt 1 tablespoon of butter.
