{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spice-Rubbed Baby Back Ribs With Chipotle-Bourbon Barbecue Sauce", "description": "The baby back (sometimes called top loin) is the perfect rib for neophytes. Cut from high on the hog \u2014 literally, it abuts the backbone \u2014 it\u2019s intrinsically tender and generously marbled, which keeps it moist during smoking. Thanks to these attributes, you can cook it at a higher temperature than the low-and-slow heat favored in the American barbecue belt. This shortens the cooking time and lets you cook the ribs on a common charcoal kettle grill. (However, you can certainly smoke these ribs low and slow at 250 degrees, in which case, you\u2019ll need 3 1/2 to 4 hours of cooking time \u2014 and a smoker.) The higher heat and shorter cooking time produce ribs with a firmer, meatier consistency. Add a chile-stung spice rub and a sweet, spicy chipotle-bourbon barbecue sauce, and you wind up with textbook barbecued ribs with a distinctive sweet, hot, smoky finish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/dining/24ribrex1/24ribrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "2 racks (2 to 4 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "american, barbecue", "recipeCategory": "dinner, barbecues, finger foods, meat, main course", "keywords": "baby back ribs, chipotle, dijon mustard, ketchup, molasses, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 238}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 racks baby back ribs (2 to 2 1/2 pounds each)", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon chile powder", "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon celery seeds", "2 large or 4 small hardwood chunks or 3 cups hardwood chips (if using the latter, soak in water to cover for 30 minutes, then drain)", "1/2 cup apple cider in a spray bottle (optional)", "1 1/4 cups ketchup", "1/3 cup Thai sweet chile sauce", "1/4 cup bourbon", "3 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "3 tablespoons molasses", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce", "1 to 2 canned chipotle chiles en adobo, minced, plus 1 to 2 teaspoons sauce", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke", "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the ribs on a rimmed baking sheet.
