{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Tofu With Cashews and Blistered Snap Peas", "description": "A ginger and coconut milk reduction can coat pretty much anything that browns nicely on its own. Here, it\u2019s pieces of pan-seared tofu, but small morsels of chicken and pork will work just as well. The soy and the teaspoons of molasses give the sauce a little caramelization, and a little shine and gloss. For a fresh side, add some blistered snap peas, tossed with sliced scallions, a little mint and a splash of rice vinegar. Snow peas, green beans, broccoli or asparagus? If it\u2019s fresh and green, it\u2019ll work just fine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/01/dining/26tofurex1/26tofurex1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, beans, main course", "keywords": "cashews, cast iron, coconut milk, extra-firm tofu, firm tofu, fresh ginger, skillet, sugar snap peas, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 7581}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) block firm or extra-firm tofu, drained", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed, vegetable or canola, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 pound snap peas, trimmed", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated (about 2 tablespoons)", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "1 (13-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk (light or full-fat)", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "2 teaspoons molasses, dark brown sugar or honey", "1/2 cup toasted cashews", "1 tablespoon rice vinegar", "4 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced", "1/4 cup mint leaves, torn if large", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "Rice or any steamed grain, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice the tofu in half horizontally, and leave on paper towels to dry any excess liquid."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium skillet or cast-iron pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high until it shimmers.
