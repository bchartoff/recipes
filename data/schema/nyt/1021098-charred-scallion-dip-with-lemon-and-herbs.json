{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Charred Scallion Dip With Lemon and Herbs", "description": "This creamy scallion dip could be the cooler cousin of ranch dressing or sour cream and onion dip. Grilled scallions add smokiness, while fresh chives and raw scallions lend brightness to the tangy, herb-flecked dip. If you don\u2019t have a grill or grill pan, you can broil the scallions in your oven. Once assembled, the dip benefits from chilling to round out the flavors. At least an hour works, but it's better after a day. It needs nothing more than potato chips alongside, but it\u2019s also great with crudit\u00e9s, crackers, grilled vegetables, fried chicken or slathered on sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/dining/aw-charred-scallion-dip/aw-charred-scallion-dip-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 1/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, barbecues, dips and spreads, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "chives, cream cheese, dill, greek yogurt, potato chips, scallion, sour cream, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, super bowl, tailgate, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 698}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 scallions, roots and tops trimmed", "3 tablespoons minced fresh chives", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill, or 1 teaspoon dried dill (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon canola oil or other neutral oil", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sour cream or Greek yogurt", "4 ounces cream cheese, softened", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest plus 1 teaspoon lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "Potato chips, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a grill or a grill pan over high."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "As pan heats up, prepare the scallion-herb mixture: Halve 2 scallions lengthwise, then slice very thinly crosswise.
