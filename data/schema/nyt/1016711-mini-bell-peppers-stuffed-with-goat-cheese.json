{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mini Bell Peppers Stuffed with Goat Cheese", "description": "This side dish is a way to take advantage of the mini sweet peppers that are showing up by the bag in supermarkets. They should be roasted briefly and not peeled.\nMy oldest brother, Dan, and his wife, Margaret, hosted a wonderful party in Minneapolis in May to celebrate their 50th anniversary. The savory food on the gorgeous vegetarian buffet was catered by the well-known Minneapolis restaurant Lucia\u2019s, whose chef/owner, Lucia Watson, is a friend of the family. One of my favorite items was minipeppers stuffed with goat cheese, the inspiration for this recipe. Mini sweet peppers have begun to proliferate in supermarkets; the ones I\u2019m finding come in 12-ounce bags, roughly 12 to a bag (though they range in size, some being about two inches long, others about three), usually a mix of red and yellow. They are thin skinned, with very small seedpods and membranes. I roast them briefly to soften them and sweeten the flavor. There is no need to peel them,   and they should not be roasted so long that the skin loosens. You will probably have a little filling left over, but it\u2019s nice as a spread so it won\u2019t go to waste. These will keep for 3 days in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/05/science/05recipehealth/05recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fall, summer, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low-carb, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 87}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 97, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "165 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound mini sweet peppers (1 package, usually 12) or small lipstick peppers", "6 ounces goat cheese (1/2 of a 12-ounce log)", "1/3 cup low-fat (not nonfat) cottage cheese", "3 tablespoons plain low-fat (not nonfat) Greek yogurt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Carefully remove any seeds and membranes. The peppers should be intact, but sometimes, they split down one side. Place any that have not split upright in a small glass or cup to facilitate filling, and pipe in goat cheese mix. Lay those that have split on a plate, pipe on the filling and close the pepper around the filling. Arrange  stuffed peppers on a plate or platter.
