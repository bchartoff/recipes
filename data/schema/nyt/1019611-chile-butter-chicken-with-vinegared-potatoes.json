{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chile-Butter Chicken With Vinegared Potatoes", "description": "A deceptively simple sheet-pan dinner, potatoes get tossed with tangy distilled white vinegar and topped with a chicken slathered in a garlicky chile butter (while you\u2019re at it, let the potatoes have some, too). From there, you pop it into a 425-degree oven and let it do its thing. The result is a juicy, golden-brown chicken with slight heat from the chile and a touch of smoke from paprika, alongside potatoes that are equal parts tender and crisp. Less, you\u2019ll see, really can be more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/dining/03roman3/merlin_141970596_9a620516-3322-4883-8e28-7cb573ceb890-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, potatoes, red pepper flakes, smoked paprika, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 631}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1236, "unsaturatedFatContent": "52 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "90 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "70 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "sodiumContent": "1455 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 1/2-pound) chicken, or 3 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon hot smoked paprika", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated", "1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 5), scrubbed and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1/4 cup distilled white vinegar", "1 cup cilantro or parsley, tender leaves and stems, coarsely chopped", "2 scallions, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
