Place a knife parallel to one chicken leg, just under it. Make a deep incision along the chicken to almost separate the drumstick from the thigh. Place the knife over the breast meat, positioning it about a third of the way from the drumstick toward the backbone. Make a deep incision from one end of the chicken to the other. Place the knife against the breastbone, and make an incision along the bone all the way down to the carcass. Repeat with other side of chicken. Pack the chicken this way for the picnic and simply pull it apart with minimal cutting when ready to serve."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6065-roasted-herbed-baby-chickens-with-spicy-mango-barbecue-sauce"}
