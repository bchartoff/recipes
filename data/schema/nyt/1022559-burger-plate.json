{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Burger Plate", "description": "Inspired by German Hamburg steak and other patties of the world, including Danish frikadeller, Japanese hambagu and Korean hambak steak, this lunch-counter meal of ground beef is seasoned with Worcestershire sauce, nutmeg and grated onion. The rest is mere assembly, arraying fresh, crunchy accoutrements to accompany the tender burgers: Tomatoes lend juiciness, dill pickles provide zing and sweet raw onions cut through the richness of the meat. Though you could sandwich all of these ingredients between two slices of toasted bread, eating them as a casual plate lunch lets you appreciate each part separately. If you\u2019d like, replace the ground beef with a plant-based ground meat substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/13/dining/ek-burger-plate2/merlin_194746833_04f9623d-c068-4dee-86f2-f6a48ace0872-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers, main course", "keywords": "ground beef, pickles, tomatoes", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 166}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small Vidalia or yellow onion, peeled and trimmed", "1 pound lean ground beef (90/10) or plant-based ground meat", "1/4 cup panko bread crumbs", "4 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "4 teaspoons ketchup, plus more for serving", "2 teaspoons dark brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil, or light olive oil", "4 slices American cheese or sharp Cheddar (optional)", "1 pound Campari, cocktail or other small tomatoes, halved or cut into wedges if large", "4 dill pickle spears, halved", "4 thick slices chewy white bread, such as sourdough, toasted and halved", "Yellow or Dijon mustard, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a Microplane or other fine grater, finely grate about 1 tablespoon of the onion from the root end into a large bowl and set aside.
