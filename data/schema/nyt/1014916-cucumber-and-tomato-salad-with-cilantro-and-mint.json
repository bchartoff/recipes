Among those cities is Glendale (not so small: it would be the second-most-populous city in New England), a center of the Armenian diaspora and home to one of the world\u2019s largest Armenian populations outside Armenia. Fleeing religious violence in the late 19th century, genocide in the early 20th or the Soviet Union after that, Armenian Californians became integral in the development of the fig, raisin and bulgur businesses. They also opened restaurants. This salad comes from one of them, Adana. The chef and owner, Edward Khechemyan, gave me the recipe in 2013.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/15/dining/15COOKING-SALAD2/15COOKING-SALAD2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "cucumber, tomato, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 409}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 72, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "309 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ripe tomatoes, chopped", "4  Persian cucumbers, chopped", "1/2  small white onion, chopped", "2 tablespoons chopped purple or green basil", "1 tablespoon chopped cilantro", "1/2 teaspoon dried mint", "1/2 teaspoon crushed red chili powder (or ancho chile powder)", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 tablespoon olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl; toss, and serve."}]}
