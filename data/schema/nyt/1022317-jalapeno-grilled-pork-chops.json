When blitzed with aromatic cilantro stems and plenty of garlic, jalape\u00f1os transform into a punchy marinade that flavors and tenderizes pork chops gloriously, and tinges them a bright Reptar-Bar green, too. That brilliant color, evidence of the chlorophyll in the peppers and herbs, stays vibrant even after a fiery kiss on the grill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/17/dining/ek-jalapeno-grilled-pork-chops/merlin_189307476_76974cf0-fc4e-4401-b0aa-bf212d18c5ac-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, pork chops, red onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1366}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 large jalape\u00f1os, stemmed", "5 large garlic cloves, peeled", "1 bunch cilantro stems, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1 packed cup)", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for cooking", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "8 thin-cut, bone-in pork loin chops (1/2-inch thick)", "1 large jalape\u00f1o, thinly sliced into rings", "1 small red onion, thinly sliced into rings", "1/3 cup rice vinegar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Cilantro leaves and tender stems, for garnish", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022318-cilantro-rice\">Cilantro rice</a> or cooked white rice, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pork chops: In a food processor, blitz the jalape\u00f1os, garlic, cilantro stems, rice vinegar, olive oil, salt and sugar until smooth.
