{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fruity Meltaways", "description": "Classic lime meltaways get their tender texture from the addition of cornstarch. Here, the cornstarch is swapped for your choice of freeze-dried fruit finely ground in a spice grinder or blender. This not only keeps the cookies delicate, but also adds a concentrated fruity punch. Any fruit will work, but choose a vibrant freeze-dried fruit, like cherries and blueberries, for a more brightly-colored cookie. Once formed into logs, the cookie dough will keep in the freezer for 3 months, helping you get ahead on your holiday baking. The freshly baked cookies are tossed in a combination of ground freeze-dried fruit and confectioners\u2019 sugar for a pretty pastel finish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sohla El-Waylly"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08COOKIESREX21-MELTAWAYS/merlin_198255087_fafde41b-47b9-4530-85ec-248ee0a3219d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "60 to 70 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "christmas cookie, freezer friendly, make-ahead", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 613}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/62 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "3 tablespoons/20 grams finely ground freeze-dried fruit, such as cherries, blueberries, strawberries, peaches or mangoes", "1 3/4 cups/224 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/93 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3 tablespoons/20 grams finely ground freeze-dried fruit"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a stiff spatula, mix butter, confectioners\u2019 sugar, salt, lemon juice and vanilla until creamy and combined.
