Filet of beef with a pistachio crust, \u201colives\u201d made with crushed pistachios and sugar syrup, panettone with pistachio paste, and also for Christmas, a simple pistachio cake. \u201cThat one I only make for Christmas,\u201d she said. Her instructions were simple and clear enough, though the baking temperature of around 120 degrees Celsius, or about 260 degrees Fahrenheit, raised some doubts. Baked at 275 degrees, the cake takes longer than the 25 minutes she suggested, but the results are excellent.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/06/dining/06PistachioREX/merlin_130159280_316da075-da1c-40e9-8a83-f02bafd0b65c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, pistachio, potato starch, strega", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 272}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 260, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "82 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter for pan", "2 1/3 cups/11 ounces/300 grams shelled pistachios, preferably Bronte from Sicily, plus more for decorating", "3/4 cup/151 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons/30 grams\u00a0potato starch or 3 tablespoons/24 grams cornstarch", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "6 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons Strega, Galliano or green Chartreuse liqueur", "Confectioners' sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 275 degrees.
