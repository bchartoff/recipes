{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Squab With Mushrooms and Pears", "description": "There\u2019s an almost infinite list of compatible dishes to match the earthy elegance of Barolo. Some gaminess, herbs, fruit and the alluring funkiness of mushrooms are the wine-friendly elements brought together in this dish, a dinner for two. The method of roasting the squab is based on the recipe in Pierre Koffmann\u2019s \u201cMemories of Gascony.\u201d It\u2019s a technique that yields perfectly medium-rare birds, so I would not mess with it. But the accompanying pear and mushroom ragout is my own, and I\u2019m quite proud of it, down to the idea of not bothering to peel the pears. You could serve the squabs whole for more drama, but quartering them makes them easier for guests to handle.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/22/dining/22PAIR/22PAIR-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "main course, mushroom, pear, squab", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 9}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1186, "unsaturatedFatContent": "47 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "89 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "63 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "sodiumContent": "1398 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 strips bacon, in 1/2-inch pieces", "1 ripe but firm Bosc pear, cored and diced", "1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered", "Salt and ground black pepper", "2 squabs", "1 tablespoon soft unsalted butter", "6 sprigs thyme, more for garnish", "6 sage leaves", "2 cloves garlic, crushed", "1/3 cup red wine", "2 tablespoons well-flavored chicken or veal stock"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
