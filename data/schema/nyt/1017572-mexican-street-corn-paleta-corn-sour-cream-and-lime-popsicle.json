Although this flavor isn't traditional, it was inspired by esquites, a favorite Mexican street food of corn dressed with sour cream, lime and chile. To make it, infuse milk with fresh sweet corn and chile, and then blend it into a smooth base. Fold in some lime and saut\u00e9ed corn for texture, and freeze for a rich, sweet-savory treat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Francis Lam"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/magazine/26eatalt/26mag-26eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H45M", "recipeYield": "About 20 3-ounce pops", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "snack, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "corn, serrano chili, sour cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups whole milk", "4 cups corn kernels (from 4 medium ears of corn; reserve the cobs)", "1 serrano chile, halved", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar", "1 cup sour cream", "1/2 lime, zested and juiced", "2 teaspoons butter", "Chile powder (optional)", "Popsicle molds or small glasses and Popsicle sticks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the milk, 2 1/2 cups corn kernels, cobs, serrano chile, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and sugar in a stockpot.
