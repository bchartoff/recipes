You boil the lobsters off and allow them to cool, then reduce the leftover stock to make a flavoring agent for mayonnaise. Add some chopped lobster knuckles to that, and serve a dollop of it alongside the claw and tail meat, perhaps with herbs or a chopped salad. It\u2019s fancy food made easy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman And Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/dining/lobstertray/lobstertray-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 30}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 515, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1325 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-pound lobsters", "2 egg yolks", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar\nor lemon juice", "1 cup neutral oil, like grapeseed\nor corn", "1 cup olive oil", "1/4 cup or more lobster stock\nSalt and black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil;\nsalt it.
