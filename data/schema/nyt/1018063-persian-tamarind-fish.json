{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Persian Tamarind Fish", "description": "In this complexly flavored and highly sophisticated dish from the cookbook author Louisa Shafia, tamarind, caramelized onion, ground almonds and barberries are made into a thick and tangy paste that gets spread over fish fillets before baking. Thinner fillets work better here than thick, center-cut pieces. You want more surface area on which to spread the herbal barberry mixture, which can be made a day ahead and stored in the fridge. If you can't find dried barberries, use dried cranberries instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/20/dining/20JPAPPE4/20JPAPPE4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "almond, barberries, bass, dried cranberries, herbs, mackerel, salmon, tamarind, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 248}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 584, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "604 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup dried barberries or cranberries", "8 (6- to 8-ounce) striped bass, mackerel or salmon fillets, 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick", "Fine sea salt, to taste", "Ground black pepper, to taste", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing and drizzling over fish", "1 large Spanish onion, halved stem to root, peeled and thinly sliced", "3 garlic cloves, minced or grated on a Microplane", "3/4 cup whole raw almonds, coarsely ground", "2 to 3 tablespoons tamarind paste or concentrate", "1 cup tightly packed minced soft fresh herbs, plus more for serving (use at least three of the following: cilantro, parsley, tarragon, basil, mint, chives)", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the barberries in a bowl and cover with warm water.
