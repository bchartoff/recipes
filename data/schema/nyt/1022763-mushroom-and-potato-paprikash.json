This version is not at all traditional, though mushrooms are common in Hungarian cooking. To make this dish doable on a weeknight, par-cook the potatoes while you\u2019re searing the mushrooms. If time is not an issue, you can skip that step, but it will increase the lid-on cooking time to about 30 minutes in Step 2. Avoid washing your mushrooms, which makes them less likely to sear. Instead, wipe off any dirt with a damp cloth. Meaty trumpet mushrooms add a wonderful texture in the stew, but you can use any mushrooms you like, including all-purpose creminis.
