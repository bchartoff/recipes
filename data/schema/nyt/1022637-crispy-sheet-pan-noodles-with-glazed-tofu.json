{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Sheet-Pan Noodles With Glazed Tofu", "description": "Contrasting textures are a signature characteristic of Cantonese chow mein, in which crispy fried strands tangle with tender noodles. Here, that is achieved with the help of a sheet pan and an intensely hot oven. To ensure optimal crunch, start with the pan on the bottom rack to crisp the underside of the noodles, then move it up to the highest to encourage crackly noodles on top, too. Instant ramen noodles are the perfect choice for this recipe because they crisp up flawlessly; just soak them in boiling hot water to loosen them up before sliding them into the oven. The hoisin-marinated tofu is subtly sweet and carries a lot of the flavor in this noodle dish. Quick cooking baby bok choy adds freshness, but you could also use leftover vegetables or seasonal produce.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/13/dining/hm-crispy-ramen/merlin_195007359_3797c15f-a677-4940-b6aa-44215246ac28-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, noodles, main course", "keywords": "bok choy, extra-firm tofu, hoisin sauce, ramen noodle, sesame oil, sheet-pan, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3547}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 blocks instant ramen noodles (about 9 ounces), flavor packets discarded", "2 tablespoons sesame oil", "2 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "Kosher salt", "1 14-ounce package extra-firm tofu, patted dry and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices", "3 baby bok choy, trimmed and sliced vertically into 4 pieces", "Handful of cilantro leaves", "2 tablespoons hoisin", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 tablespoon maple syrup", "1 garlic clove, grated", "1 teaspoon sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees and place one rack on the top and one on the bottom.
