{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tagliatelle With Mushrooms in Red Wine", "description": "This hearty, umami-rich pasta dish is easily assembled in less than an hour. For the best texture, use your hands and not the food processor. Chopping the mushrooms and crushing the tomatoes by hand ensures some uniformity. The sauce can be prepared in advance, since you will summon the powers of the cooking water from the tagliatelle. Use more, if needed, to moisten the mixture before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/14/dining/14pairing/merlin_133233111_ff56f921-c667-4ee7-8e8f-2710b9bca465-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "anchovy paste, cremini, pancetta, red wine, tagliatelle, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 261}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 591, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "975 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 ounces pancetta, diced", "12 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean, cut in 1/2-inch dice", "Salt", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "4 cloves garlic, minced", "4 canned San Marzano tomatoes, drained and finely crushed with a fork", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1 teaspoon anchovy paste", "Ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1 pound fresh tagliatelle or fettuccine", "Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large (12- to 14-inch) skillet or saut\u00e9 pan.
