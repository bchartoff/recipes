{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sorghum Bowl With Black Beans, Amaranth and Avocado", "description": "Sorghum reminds me of Israeli couscous, spherical and about the same size. Like Israeli couscous, it\u2019s good with brothy stews. I love the way the firm, round grains stand up against the soft, brothy beans in this bean and amaranth stew. You can find amaranth at many farmers\u2019 markets and Asian markets. The beautiful purple and green leaves are high in anthocyanins, known for their antioxidant properties, as are black beans. Substitute baby spinach if you can\u2019t find it.<br/><br/>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/29/science/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "amaranth greens, black beans, sorghum, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1163, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "201 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "29 grams", "proteinContent": "47 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "830 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound (2 1/8 cups) black beans", "1 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "2 to 4 garlic cloves, to taste, minced", "2 or 3 epazote sprigs, if available", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro, plus sprigs for garnish", "Salt to taste", "1 cup sorghum", "1 generous bunch amaranth, stemmed and coarsely chopped (an 8-ounce bunch, 6 cups chopped)", "1 large ripe Hass avocado, sliced or diced", "Crumbled queso blanco or feta for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the black beans, pick them over for stones, and place them in a bowl.
