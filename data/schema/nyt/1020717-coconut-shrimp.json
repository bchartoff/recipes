{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Shrimp", "description": "No one really knows the origins of fried coconut shrimp, the crunchy, breaded kind that\u2019s served in chain steakhouses and beachfront restaurants, but its roots are likely found in the tiki bar culture, which was all the rage in the United States after World War II, when access to tropical produce like coconuts and pineapples became an everyday thing. Using egg whites instead of whole eggs and cornstarch instead of flour yields shrimp that are simultaneously crunchy yet light, and go just as well with pi\u00f1a coladas as they do with Champagne. We paired ours with a simple spicy-sweet dip made with marmalade, Dijon mustard and Sriracha, but you can also serve them with store-bought sweet chile sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/12/dining/ml-coconut-shrimp/ml-coconut-shrimp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 24 shrimp", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, weeknight, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, coconut, coconut flakes, orange marmalade, panko, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 71}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup orange marmalade or apricot preserves", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon Sriracha or other chile sauce (optional)", "1 teaspoon fresh lime juice, plus more as needed", "Pinch of salt", "1/2 cup cornstarch", "1 tablespoon fresh lime zest (from 2 to 3 limes)", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne (optional)", "4 large egg whites", "1 cup finely shredded unsweetened coconut", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound large raw shrimp (21 to 25 count), peeled and deveined, with tails attached", "4 to 5 tablespoons coconut or canola oil, for frying, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dip: In a small bowl, combine marmalade, mustard, Sriracha (if using), lime juice and salt.
