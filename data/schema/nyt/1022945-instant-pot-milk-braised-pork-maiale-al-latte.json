{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Instant Pot Milk-Braised Pork (Maiale al Latte)", "description": "This is a classic dish from Emilia-Romagna, a region in Italy where dairy and meat feature heavily in the traditional cuisine. Marcella Hazan wrote in her book, \u201cEssentials of Classic Italian Cooking,\u201d that maiale al latte is one of a handful of dishes that \u201cmost clearly express the genius\u201d of regional Italian cooking. At its simplest, it is tough, inexpensive pork braised to finely textured tenderness in a pot of whole milk. As the caramelized milk reduces, it separates into extremely delicious curds and sauce infused with herbs and lemon. Serve this pressure-cooker version with bread or over polenta, pappardelle or rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/31/dining/sd-instant-pot-braised-pork/sd-instant-pot-braised-pork-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "herbs, instant pot, leeks, milk, pork shoulder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 675}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds boneless, skinless pork shoulder, cut into 4 large chunks\u00a0\u00a0", "Coarse kosher salt\u00a0", "1/4 cup vegetable oil\u00a0", "1 large or 2 small leeks, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced\u00a0", "10 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed\u00a0", "3 (2-inch) strips lemon zest, plus lemon slices for serving", "4 sprigs fresh thyme\u00a0", "4 sprigs fresh sage\u00a0", "2 sprigs fresh rosemary\u00a0", "5 cups whole milk\u00a0", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the pork generously with salt on all sides.
