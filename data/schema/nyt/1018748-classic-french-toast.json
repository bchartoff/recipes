{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic French Toast", "description": "Here's a recipe for the kind of French toast people line up for outside restaurants\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0morning.\u00a0It's simple: no new ingredients, tools or technology needed. You don\u2019t even need stale bread. What you do need is thick-cut white bread, dunked into an egg-milk mixture with extra richness from egg yolks and heavy cream. That gives the French toast a buttery taste and firm but fluffy texture. (Oversoaking is the enemy here; the mixture should fill the bread, not cause it to break.)\u00a0For an appetizing, lacy brown crust, sprinkle on sugar toward the end of cooking: It will caramelize and turn glossy. Just make sure to keep the heat low after you add the sugar. Otherwise, it could burn quickly over high heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/03/dining/03FRENCHTOAST2/03FRENCHTOAST2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, pancakes", "keywords": "eggs, pullman bread, whole milk, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 676}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 390, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "463 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 whole eggs", "2 egg yolks", "2 cups whole milk, or 1 3/4 cups milk, plus 2 to 4 tablespoons cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)", "Pinch of salt", "Unsalted butter, for cooking", "8 slices white bread, such as Pullman, brioche or challah, sliced 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick", "Cinnamon sugar or granulated sugar (see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 200 degrees, and place a wire rack on a sheet pan inside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs, additional yolks, milk, vanilla (if using) and salt until foamy and smooth.
