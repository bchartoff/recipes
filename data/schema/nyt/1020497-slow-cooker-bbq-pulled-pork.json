{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker BBQ Pulled Pork", "description": "If you\u2019ve spent any time on Pinterest or food blogs, you\u2019ve likely come across a recipe for three-ingredient barbecue pulled pork that can be made in the slow cooker. Methods and ingredients vary, but the recipe almost always calls for boneless pork shoulder, some sort of dark cola (usually Dr Pepper or root beer) and barbecue sauce. Dubious? We were too, so we asked the members of our NYT Cooking Community Facebook page if anyone had ever made it and if they liked it. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/permalink/2435095033251993/\">We received more than 150 very opinionated responses</a>. Many readers have come up with their own clever twists, like using coffee or beer in place of cola, adding onions or chipotles, rubbing the meat with a spice blend and searing the meat before cooking. We tried cooking it a few different ways and found we liked this adaptation best. It calls for a few more ingredients and an extra step or two, but it\u2019s got layers of flavor and it\u2019s still mostly fuss-free.

Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Sear the pork until golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes each side. Add onion, if using, to the slow cooker.

Add about 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce and stir to combine.

Taste and add more barbecue sauce, hot sauce, salt or pepper, if desired. Serve with soft rolls and extra sauce on the side."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020497-slow-cooker-bbq-pulled-pork"}
