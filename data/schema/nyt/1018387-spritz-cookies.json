A cookie press (think of a caulking machine, but with cookie dough) offers lots of versatility, whether you're looking for wreaths for the holidays or hearts for Valentine's Day. Just beat together the ingredients, and place the dough in the press just after mixing. Push the dough through onto parchment paper, decorate with colored sugars and bake. They'll add a bit of color and joy to any cookie platter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/01/dining/01COOKING-DAY-COOKIES/01COOKING-DAY-COOKIES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "butter, eggs, flour, salt, sugar, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 317}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 220, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "104 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter", "1 1/4 cups granulated sugar", "3 large eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Coarse or decorative sugar, sesame seeds or poppy seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
