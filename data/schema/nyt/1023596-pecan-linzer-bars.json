The buttery dough bakes up tender, but it can be difficult to roll out. Here, we\u2019re using the same components in a simplified way: pressing in the crust, crumbling over the topping and baking in a brownie pan before cutting into bars. You can use any nut and preserve combination, but the traditional filling of raspberry jam or red currant jelly offers a nice hit of acidity to contrast the sweet cookie crust.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sohla el-Waylly"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/31/dining/se-pecan-linzer-bars/merlin_215480763_cf167d01-3043-496a-b69c-94daa77ea350-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "18 bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bar cookie, christmas cookie, food processor, pecan, raspberry jam, christmas, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 425}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter, softened, or nonstick spray for pan", "1 cup/120 grams raw pecan halves and pieces", "2/3 cup/142 grams packed light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1 stick/113 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature\u00a0", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams all-purpose flour", "1 (13-ounce/370-gram) jar raspberry jam or red currant jelly (about 1 heaped cup)", "Flaky salt", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350 degrees.
