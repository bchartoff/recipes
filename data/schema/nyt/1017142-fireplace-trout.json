{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fireplace Trout", "description": "Here is a recipe for trout like the one we ate in Maine. I now add garlic cooked in olive oil, because I have watched enigmatic Basques add it to regal white hake they cook above coals burned from oak. It goes well with the simple trout's innate subtlety and faint whiff of wood smoke, and it all ends up resolutely likable.\n\nThis takes only a few minutes, and mostly needs only the fire that's already in your fireplace. I think it prudent to cook the garlic in a separate pan on the stove, leaving the fish the only thing to attend to on the actual fire \u2014 at least until you are confident and happy before the old Egyptian monster. It is doable all in one pan, but it is quite important to not let something simple and fun and ancient begin to seem complicated.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/25/magazine/25eat/25eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "new england", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "main course, trout", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 355, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "114 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup olive oil, divided equally in two", "3 big cloves garlic, halved lengthwise and sliced", "4 fillets rainbow trout", "1/8 teaspoon salt plus more for seasoning the fish", "2 sprigs thyme"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a frying or saut\u00e9 pan, heat 1/4 cup olive oil until just warm.
