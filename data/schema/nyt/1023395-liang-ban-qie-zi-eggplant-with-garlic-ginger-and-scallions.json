{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Liang Ban Qie Zi (Eggplant With Garlic, Ginger and Scallions)", "description": "The Shanghainese dish of seasoned and steamed eggplant is typically served cold, but this version can also be eaten warm or at room temperature. Steaming eggplant is a revelation \u2014 it brings out the vegetable\u2019s gentle, earthy flavor and creates an astonishingly silky, light texture that soaks up sauces efficiently. Here, the eggplant is topped with an aromatic mix of garlic, ginger and scallions, which release their intoxicating fragrance when hot oil is poured over. Regular globe eggplant is fine, and long Japanese or Chinese eggplant works just as well (use the same weight). A steamer insert, bamboo steamer or stainless steel trivet is a smart investment that makes steaming in a wide, deep skillet simple, but you can also use stainless steel cookie cutters or balls of aluminum foil. Use tamari in place of soy sauce for an easy gluten-free substitution.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/09/dining/hm-garlicky-steamed-eggplant/merlin_210788820_6b60ab11-7549-47ba-b7b3-03d7c30a0865-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "eggplant, garlic, ginger, scallion, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 846}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds eggplant (1 large), base and stem trimmed", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon black vinegar (such as Chinkiang vinegar)", "1 tablespoon chile crisp or chile oil (preferably one that contains Sichuan peppercorns)", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped", "2 scallions, trimmed, white and green parts finely sliced", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)", "3 tablespoons neutral oil such as canola or grapeseed", "Rice, to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set up a wide, deep skillet or wok with a steamer insert, bamboo steamer or stainless steel trivet (see Tip).
