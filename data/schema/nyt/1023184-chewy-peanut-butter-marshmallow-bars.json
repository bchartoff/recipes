{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chewy Peanut Butter-Marshmallow Bars", "description": "Classic cereal treats for the peanut butter fanatic, these marshmallow bars call for cornflakes instead of Rice Krispies, making for a wonderfully chewy-crunchy contrast. Cornflakes are delicate, so the key here is to avoid crushing the cereal too much when mixing the ingredients. The end result should be airy and chewy, but not dense, with visible chunks of marshmallow throughout. This recipe comes together quickly, so have your ingredients measured and ready to add to the pot when you begin. Once the chocolate topping has set, these bars pack well for picnics or potlucks, but if you\u2019re concerned about the chocolate melting, you can skip it altogether and finish the bars with a sprinkle of sea salt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/11/dining/lh-marshmallow-treats/lh-marshmallow-treats-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H20M", "recipeYield": "16 to 20 bars", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "chocolate, cornflakes, marshmallow, memorial day, super bowl, tailgate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 171}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "6 cups/200 grams cornflake cereal", "1 (12-ounce/340-gram) bag large marshmallows", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 cup/125 grams natural creamy peanut butter", "4 ounces/115 grams semisweet chocolate (preferably bar chocolate), roughly chopped", "Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grease a 9-inch square pan with butter and sprinkle 1/2 cup/17 grams of the cornflakes on the bottom of the pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, melt the 6 tablespoons/85 grams butter over medium-low heat.
