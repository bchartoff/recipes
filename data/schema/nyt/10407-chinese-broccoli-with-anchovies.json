He served the gail lan, Chinese broccoli, with a crisp pork and scrambled-egg dish, all in a bowl over a little white rice. Anchovies and garlic are the aromatic here, and the dish comes together in under 15 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "Serves 2", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, lunch, quick", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, chinese broccoli, garlic, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 522, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1251 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound gai lan, rinsed and trimmed", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "1/2 teaspoon minced garlic", "8 anchovy fillets, roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons rice wine", "1/4 cup chicken broth", "2 teaspoons Vietnamese fish sauce", "Cooked white rice, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Split the large stalks of gai lan in half lengthwise. Place a large saut\u00e9 pan over high heat and add the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the garlic and anchovies and cook, pressing on the anchovies with a wooden spoon until they dissolve and the garlic lightly browns. Add the gai lan and toss in the sauce to coat. Pour in the rice wine and let it reduce for 1 minute. Add the chicken broth and fish sauce, bring to a boil, cover and steam until almost tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Uncover and cook at a lively simmer until the gai lan is tender and the sauce has evaporated slightly. Serve with white rice and the crisp pork with scrambled eggs."}]}
