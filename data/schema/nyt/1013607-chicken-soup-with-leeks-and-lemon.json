{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Soup With Leeks and Lemon", "description": "This is inspired by both the classic Greek soup avgolemono and Scottish cockaleekee. Start with a flavorful chicken or turkey broth, simmer leeks and rice or bulgur in the soup until tender, then enrich with eggs and lemon. The trick here is to begin with a flavorful stock and not to allow the eggs to curdle when you combine the soup and the avgolemono sauce. You can make a vegetarian version of this using a garlic broth or by making a robust vegetable stock using the dark leafy parts of the leeks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/18/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, chicken, leek, healthy", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 444}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 271, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1082 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 quarts chicken or turkey stock, preferably homemade", "1 pound leeks, white and light green parts only, cleaned and sliced thin", "2/3 cup rice or coarse bulgur (to taste)", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "Fresh juice of 2 lemons, strained, or about 6 to 8 tablespoons, to taste", "Salt to taste", "Freshly ground pepper", "Chopped fresh parsley or dill for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the stock and leeks, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer 20 minutes.
