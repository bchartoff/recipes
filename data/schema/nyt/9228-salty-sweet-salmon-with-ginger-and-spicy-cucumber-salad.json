{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salty-Sweet Salmon With Ginger and Spicy Cucumber Salad", "description": "This 2006 recipe came to The Times by way of David Myers, the American chef and restaurateur, when Amanda Hesser called upon him to re-interpret <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9227-chinese-barbecued-spareribs\">this 1961 Times recipe for Chinese barbecued spareribs</a>. He kept the simple soy-garlic-ketchup (yes, ketchup) marinade intact and applied it to salmon. He then served it with a preserved ginger relish and a cucumber salad seasoned with shichimi togarashi, a fiery Japanese spice blend (red pepper flakes make a fine substitute). If you don't have the time to make the relish and cucumber salad, serve the salmon with a few slivers of preserved ginger from a jar, a pile of white rice and some saut\u00e9ed greens. That's better than your standard grilled salmon by a mile.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/07/dining/07COOKING-SALMON-GINGER/07COOKING-SALMON-GINGER-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "cucumber, ginger, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 281}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 521, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "2461 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup fish sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons rice-wine vinegar", "3/4 teaspoon sugar, or to taste", "1/4 cup peeled and finely grated (or minced) ginger", "1/4 cup honey", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1 clove garlic, crushed", "1 1/2 tablespoons ketchup", "4 6-ounce pieces salmon fillet", "1 cup rice-wine vinegar", "1/4 cup sugar", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon togarashi (or ground red pepper flakes)", "1 1/2 teaspoons grated ginger", "1 English cucumber, seeded and sliced 1/8,-inch thick"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the preserved ginger: The day before, whisk together the fish sauce, rice-wine vinegar and sugar, then add the ginger.
