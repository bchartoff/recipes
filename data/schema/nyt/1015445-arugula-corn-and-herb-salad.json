But interestingly, according to Bloomberg Businessweek, shoppers are not likely to see higher prices for corn on the cob because sweet corn is not as vulnerable to drought conditions. Corn on the cob that is sold in supermarkets is an irrigated crop, like other vegetables and fruits grown on large farms. However, smaller farms that sell their produce at farmers\u2019 markets in drought-stricken areas are having a difficult time with their yields, so you may see a spike in prices there. The season for good, fresh sweet corn is such a short one that I will pay the price for it, just as I\u2019ll spend money on heirloom tomatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/21/science/20recipehealth/20recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "gluten-free, healthy, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 142, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "265 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large ear of corn", "6 ounces baby arugula, washed and spun dry", "2 tablespoons chopped or slivered fresh herbs, like basil, tarragon, chives, parsley, marjoram", "1 ounce shaved Parmesan", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 small garlic clove, pur\u00e9ed (optional)", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 medium-size ripe tomatoes, cut in wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam the corn until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
