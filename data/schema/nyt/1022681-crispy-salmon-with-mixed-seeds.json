{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Salmon With Mixed Seeds", "description": "This recipe produces not only silky salmon with a crunchy coating of fragrant seeds, but also a shatteringly crisp skin. That\u2019s all thanks to yogurt, which secures the seeds to the salmon and caramelizes into a crust when cooked. Mix assertive and mild seeds for a balance of textures and flavors, or swap in a ready-made seed mix like everything bagel spice or dukkah. Eat the seared salmon with more yogurt, as well as a squeeze of citrus and tuft of herbs for freshness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/26/dining/as-crispy-salmon-with-mixed-seeds/merlin_189371934_3b038880-f0fc-496c-96fe-048eaaecb898-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "salmon, seeds, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 404}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups loosely packed soft herb leaves and tender stems (such as mint, dill, cilantro or parsley, or a combination)", "1 lemon or lime", "1 cup full-fat Greek yogurt", "Kosher salt", "1 tablespoon sesame, millet or sunflower seeds", "1 1/2 teaspoons fennel, cumin or coriander seeds", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Finely chop 2 tablespoons of the herbs, and set aside the remaining herbs in a small bowl or measuring cup.
