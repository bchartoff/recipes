{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp Toast", "description": "Shrimp toast, also known as prawn toast, is a widely popular Cantonese dim sum staple that embodies both Chinese and western influences. Originating in China\u2019s Guangdong Province, the dish spread to other Asian countries and eventually across the globe. A shrimp toast resurgence has led to playful versions appearing on restaurant menus, taking it beyond a simple snack. Traditionally, shrimp toast starts with a shrimp paste that\u2019s infused with aromatic garlic, scallions and cilantro, which is then slathered on white bread that is fried until crisp on the outside and light inside. A food processor makes quick work of chopping the shrimp mixture, but the task can also be done by hand. In this recipe, the shrimp toast is coated in sesame seeds before frying, giving it an extra layer of nutty flavor and crunchy texture. The shrimp paste can be made one day ahead and chilled until ready to use.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/28/dining/kc-shrimp-toast/kc-shrimp-toast-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, appetizer", "keywords": "cilantro, sesame seeds, shrimp, small plate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 139}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 scallions, cut into 1-inch pieces", "2 garlic cloves", "1/4 cup cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1/2 pound peeled and deveined large shrimp", "1 large egg white", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "Salt and pepper", "1/3 cup white sesame seeds", "4 slices white sandwich bread", "1 1/2 to 2 cups neutral oil (such as canola or vegetable), for shallow frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, combine scallions, garlic and cilantro; pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides of bowl.
