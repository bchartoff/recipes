It came to The Times via the Twitter account of Andrew Zimmern, who eats bugs on television as the host of \u201cBizarre Foods\u201d on the Travel Channel but lives a sedate life back home in Minnesota when he\u2019s not working, which is not often. His wife, Rishia Zimmern, adapted it from Martha Stewart, and he put it on the social network: \u201cBrown 8 thighs, 3 C shallots. Add wine, tarragon, Dijon, sim 30 min covered. Remove lid, reduce. Add 2C cut cherry toms.\u201d We\u2019ve been messing around with that ever since, and thrill to its flavor. Lay in bread to accompany it, and sop up the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/23/magazine/23eat/23eat-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, shallot", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 4543}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 658, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1115 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8\u00a0bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "2\u00a0tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1\u00a0tablespoon kosher salt", "1\u00a0tablespoon black pepper", "2\u00a0tablespoons unsalted butter", "12 to 15\u00a0whole medium shallots, peeled", "2\u00a0cups white wine", "2\u00a0tablespoons Dijon mustard", "2\u00a0tarragon\u00a0sprigs", "2\u00a0cups cherry tomatoes, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the chicken thighs very dry with paper towels.
