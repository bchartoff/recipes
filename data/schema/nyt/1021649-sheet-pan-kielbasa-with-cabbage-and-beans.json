{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Kielbasa With Cabbage and Beans", "description": "This sheet-pan dinner of roasted kielbasa, caramelized cabbage and white beans marinated in a dill-and-red wine vinaigrette comes together in about a half-hour. There are many different types of kielbasa, but the smoked version typically found at American grocery stores is horseshoe-shaped and, when roasted, tastes a little like pepperoni. Feel free to play around with substitutions: You can use green or red cabbage for the Savoy, though the leaves won\u2019t get quite as frizzled and golden. Instead of dill, chives or parsley can bring freshness. Instead of shallot, use scallions, red-pepper flakes or grated garlic for sharp heat. Instead of mustard, you could use horseradish, chopped pickles or sauerkraut for briny acidity.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/dining/as-kielbasa-and-cabbage/as-kielbasa-and-cabbage-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, sausages, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "cabbage, dill, kielbasa, white beans, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1514}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium Savoy cabbage (2 to 2 1/2 pounds), cut through the root into 1-inch-thick wedges", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for tossing the cabbage", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 ounces to 1 pound smoked kielbasa, diagonally sliced 1/4-inch-thick", "1/4 cup red wine vinegar", "1/4 cup finely chopped fresh dill", "1 shallot, finely chopped", "4 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 (14-ounce) can white beans, such as great Northern or cannellini, drained and rinsed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
