{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fruit-Filled Scuffins", "description": "The scuffin is a frankenpastry \u2014 part scone, part muffin and, like a doughnut, filled with jam \u2014 but despite its complex genetics, it is very easy to make. It is even somewhat healthy (for a pastry, that is), using whole grain flour and flaxseeds, and keeping the butter minimal. If you are more of a butter maximalist, feel free to indulge by making a crumb topping for the scuffins: Measure 3 ounces cool butter (instead of 2 ounces melted butter) and use your fingers to rub it into the dry ingredients until coarse crumbs form. The spices can be varied (swap in nutmeg, ginger or allspice for the cinnamon or cardamom), and so can the jams. Do not use jelly, though \u2014 only jams, conserves, preserves or fruit butter will do.
