{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Squash With Turmeric-Ginger Chickpeas", "description": "Custardy, mildly sweet roasted squash holds its own as a main course in this easy weeknight recipe. Although fresh turmeric root is suitable, a high-quality ground turmeric will do a better job of infusing the chickpeas with its earthy, floral notes. Marinating the chickpeas a day or two ahead will allow the turmeric, ginger and other aromatics to intensify in flavor. If you do make this ahead of time, hold off on tossing in the fresh herbs until just before serving. Pomegranate seeds add color and crunch, and a dollop of yogurt would be the last of your obligations, if you want to take this dish out of vegan territory.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/19/dining/YK-roasted-squash-chickpeas/YK-roasted-squash-chickpeas-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, vegetables", "keywords": "chickpea, ginger, herbs, squash, thyme, turmeric, fall, winter, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 481}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1263, "unsaturatedFatContent": "66 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "126 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "79 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1065 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds squash, such as butternut, honeynut, acorn or kabocha, seeds removed, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "10 sprigs fresh thyme", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil", "Kosher salt and black\u00a0pepper", "1 small red onion, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)", "1/4 cup apple cider vinegar", "4 garlic cloves, sliced", "2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and grated", "1 (14-ounce) can chickpeas, drained", "1 cup mixed torn fresh herbs, such as mint, cilantro, parsley and-or dill", "4 cups spicy salad greens, such as arugula or mizuna", "1/2 cup whole-milk yogurt", "1/4 cup pomegranate seeds (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
