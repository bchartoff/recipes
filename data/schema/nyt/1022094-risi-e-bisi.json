{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Risi e Bisi", "description": "The classic Venetian dish of rice and peas known as risi e bisi makes for a perfect springtime Sunday lunch. This version includes the addition of baby zucchini, which is an acknowledged departure from tradition but a mighty delicious one. The desired final consistency is loose, almost brothy, not tight and creamy like risotto nor drippy like a zuppa. The Venetians use the term \u201call\u2019onda,\u201d a reference to the swell of waves in the sea. Short-grain rice helps get that distinct starchy quality, but the rice can\u2019t do the job by itself; there has to be stirring throughout. Pour yourself a glass of a good Soave while you stir. You can have a nap after lunch, which is totally traditional.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/18/magazine/18mag-eat-02/18mag-eat-02-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, grains and rice, main course", "keywords": "arborio rice, parmesan, peas, zucchini, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 897}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 cups Parmigiano-Reggiano rind broth or chicken broth", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "6 scallions, roots trimmed, then sliced", "Salt and pepper", "12 ounces baby zucchini, cut into coins", "1 cup carnaroli or arborio rice", "3 garlic cloves, peeled", "10 ounces fresh shelled peas", "3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat broth in a small pot on the back burner over medium-low."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a wide, shallow, long-handled pan over medium-low.
