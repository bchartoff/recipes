{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nashville-Style Hot Tofu Sliders", "description": "Nashville hot chicken is seasoned with a bold dose of ground cayenne and hot sauce, deep fried then brushed with a final coat of spicy oil. In these vegetarian sliders, hot butter imparts mild tofu with an extra-spicy kick reminiscent of the chicken that inspired them. Tofu has a high water content, but a quick dredge in rice flour and a dip in batter creates a barrier that prevents excess splattering during frying. The carbonation in seltzer keeps the batter light and airy, perfect for delicate tofu. (This is also a great trick for frying vegetables and shrimp.) The result is a golden sandwich filling with a crispy exterior and soft center. For larger sandwiches, stuff standard hamburger buns with two pieces of the fried tofu and finish with the toppings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/26/dining/kc-nashville-style-hot-tofu-sliders/kc-nashville-style-hot-tofu-sliders-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "butter, hot sauce, rice flour, tofu, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 900}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar", "1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce (such as Tabasco)\u00a0", "1 tablespoon ground cayenne", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1 (14- to 16-ounce) package firm tofu, drained", "1/4 cup whole milk", "1/2 cup white rice flour", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons chilled seltzer or club soda", "Vegetable oil, for shallow frying\u00a0", "Mayonnaise", "8 slider buns or 4 slices white bread", "Lettuce, such as iceberg or butter", "Sliced dill pickles"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the hot butter: In a small bowl, combine all ingredients and whisk until well blended.
