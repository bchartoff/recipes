And it is a reassuringly straightforward recipe. Make the crust and press it into a pan, bake it and let it cool. Drizzle a warm cinnamon glaze over it, cut and serve. Inhaling is wonderful; eating is even better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/13/dining/13COOKING-CINNAMONBARS/13COOKING-CINNAMONBARS-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "16 squares", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "cane syrup, cinnamon, flour, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 171}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 218, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "26 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup confectioners' sugar", "1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 pound (2 sticks) cold butter, cut into small cubes", "6 tablespoons butter", "1 tablespoon cane syrup like Lyle's Golden Syrup (or substitute dark corn syrup)", "1/2 cup confectioners' sugar", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare base: heat oven to 325 degrees.
