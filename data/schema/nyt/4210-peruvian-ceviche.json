Walking the streets of Lima, it is hard to go three blocks without finding a cevicheria serving up the popular delicacy. Versions are also sold from mobile vending wagons pushed along the dusty streets of the capital's shantytowns and at fine eating establishments in the most affluent residential areas. This one, with its spicy red peppers and tart lemon juice, would go well with corn and sweet potatoes, a light and refreshing meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nathaniel C.
