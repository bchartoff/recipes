{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Broccoli and Potato Tacos With Fried Eggs", "description": "These weeknight tacos are packed with nutrient-dense broccoli and comforting potatoes for a satisfying meal that comes together in just 45 minutes. The secret to its flavor lies in roasting the vegetables over high heat without stirring, which allows their edges to become smoked and crisp. Creamy egg yolks and deep, smoky paprika meld here, to create a rich sauce. If you\u2019re short on time, you can roast the vegetables ahead of time and rewarm them, or even serve them at room temperature. Corn tortillas are used here, but flour tortillas can also be used. And feel free to customize them as you like, using all the suggested toppings or just some.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/12/dining/kc-broccoli-tacos/merlin_153033774_5318947e-42f9-453f-b804-90589a6ae19b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, tacos, vegetables", "keywords": "avocado, broccoli, egg, potato, scallion, tortilla, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 120}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large broccoli florets (about 8 cups)", "1 pound fingerling or baby white potatoes, sliced crosswise 1/4-inch thick (about 4 cups)", "1 bunch scallions (8 ounces), cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 cups)", "3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "10 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 (6-inch) corn tortillas", "8 large eggs", "2 avocados, cut into wedges", "Salsa, sour cream, cilantro sprigs and lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.\u00a0On a large rimmed baking sheet, combine broccoli, potatoes, scallions and garlic with the paprika and 6 tablespoons oil.
