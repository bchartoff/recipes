{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mezcal Fresca", "description": "In this mezcal-laced take on an agua fresca, the sweet-tart hibiscus syrup and warm allspice dram act in tandem to add layers of flavor and texture while softening mezcal\u2019s inherent smokiness. The mix of grapefruit and lime lends the drink acidity without tipping it acerbic. Because mezcal ranges in flavor, complexity and smoky bite, taste a few and choose one that suits your preferences. And, if you also happen to have sal de gusano \u2014 a traditional accompaniment to mezcal made from toasted, ground gusano (the moth larvae that feeds on the agave plant), salt and dried chiles \u2014 you can rim your cocktail glass with it. To do so, run the cut side of a grapefruit or lime along the rim and dip the rim in the salt mixture before shaking and pouring your drink.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/dining/24smokerex1-mezcal/merlin_198116955_a3289bce-c0cf-473c-a972-4b4af8d717fe-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "allspice dram, hibiscus blossoms, mezcal", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 108}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried hibiscus flowers, also called flor de jamaica", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon smoked flaky salt", "Ice", "1 1/2 ounces mezcal", "1/2 ounce hibiscus syrup", "1/2 ounce allspice dram", "1/2 ounce fresh grapefruit juice", "1/4 ounce fresh lime juice", "Soda water, for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the hibiscus syrup: In a saucepan, combine the hibiscus blossoms and 1 cup water, and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
