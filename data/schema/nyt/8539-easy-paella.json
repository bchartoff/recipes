{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Easy Paella", "description": "You may not think of paella as a weeknight dish, but this half-hour recipe might change your mind. The trick is to start it on the stove and finish it in a superhot oven so you get a nice, crisp crust on the bottom. The name \u201cpaella\u201d refers not to a combination of rice, seafood, sausage and other meats, but rather to the paellera, a large pan that looks like a flat wok. But you don't need one to make a good paella. A cast-iron skillet will do just fine. Shrimp is called for here, but you can use chicken, sausage, vegetables, scallops, pork or firm tofu in its place.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/dining/MB-minimalist-paella/merlin_147141300_95535a6c-3604-4948-9b2a-059920059bbb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "chicken stock, rice, shrimp, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 279}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 605, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "89 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1024 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups chicken stock (see text)", "Pinch saffron", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium onion, minced", "2 cups short- or medium-grain rice", "Salt and fresh black pepper to taste", "2 cups raw peeled shrimp, cut into 1/2-inch chunks", "Minced parsley for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, or as near as you can.
