{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pesto Pasta With White Beans and Halloumi", "description": "This vegetarian weeknight dinner comes together in half an hour and is made super special with the addition of halloumi. It looks like a fluffy cloud when grated, and it gives the pasta just the right amount of salty tang. Be sure to use a very fine grater, like a Microplane, when you prepare the halloumi, as it will only add to the fluffy effect (which is what you\u2019re after). This is a full meal in its own right, but you can also serve it alongside a big green salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/10/dining/10OTTOREX-pasta/13-OTTOREX-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "arugula, cannellini beans, halloumi, pasta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 907}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/75 milliliters olive oil", "6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 medium green serrano chile, stemmed and halved lengthwise", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped", "2 (15.5-ounce/400-gram) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed\u00a0", "3 cups (about 9 ounces/250 grams) short, twirled pasta, preferably gemelli or trofie pasta", "3 cups/700 milliliters chicken or vegetable stock\u00a0", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters lemon juice (from 2 lemons)", "1 block halloumi (around 7 ounces/200 grams), very finely grated", "Heaping 1/3 cup/50 grams pine nuts, well toasted", "2 small garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "3 lightly packed cups (about 2 ounces/60 grams) arugula (rocket), roughly chopped", "1/2 cup/20 grams roughly chopped parsley (leaves and tender stems only)", "1/3 cup/90 milliliters olive oil, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pasta: Add the oil to a large, lidded saut\u00e9 pan, and then place it over medium-high heat.
