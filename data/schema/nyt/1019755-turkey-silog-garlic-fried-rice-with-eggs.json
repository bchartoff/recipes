{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Silog (Garlic Fried Rice With Eggs)", "description": "Silog, rice bathed in lots of garlic and crowned with a runny egg, is a hearty and essential part of any Filipino breakfast, and it comes together very quickly. For Chad and Chase Valencia, brothers and owners of the Filipino restaurant Lasa, in Los Angeles,  the best time to make\u00a0silog is the morning after Thanksgiving, when they top it with seared leftover turkey (or ham), and gravy to moisten the bits of rice. You're going to have to plan ahead for this recipe, as it\u2019s best made with day-old rice; freshly made rice won't get as crisp in the pan. And don't be intimidated by the amount of garlic here \u2014 it all mellows out, while still providing a potent punch. Chad notes that this dish will work in almost any nonstick pan, except for a steel or aluminum-bottomed pan; you could even use a well-seasoned cast-iron pan or wok.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/21valenciarex1/merlin_146709318_85135471-f0bf-42ad-bef3-e00cc3da2758-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, grains and rice", "keywords": "eggs, ham, rice, turkey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 104}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup canola or other neutral oil, plus more as needed", "8 to 12 garlic cloves, to taste, peeled and ends trimmed", "Kosher salt", "8 cups day-old cooked white jasmine rice", "1 to 1 1/2 cups leftover gravy (omit if using ham)", "1 1/2 pounds leftover turkey or ham, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "4 eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the garlic fried rice: Heat a large nonstick pan (preferably 10 inches) over a medium-low flame, then add 6 tablespoons of the oil and garlic cloves.
