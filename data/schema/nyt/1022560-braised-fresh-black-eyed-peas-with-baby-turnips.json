{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Fresh Black-Eyed Peas With Baby Turnips", "description": "Fresh black-eyed peas, still in their pods, are a pretty pale green, with a gorgeous purple-black O-ring on each tiny pea. They\u2019re tender and creamy and snappy \u2014 with an earthy flavor that goes well with the mint, pepper and turnips in this shallow braise \u2014 and they cook in just minutes unlike their wintered-over chalky, drab dried counterparts. I love them when they come in fresh at the market, and also love the so-called chore of shucking them. The chance to sit for a minute and watch the world go by while shelling a big pile of fresh peas will always leave you feeling glad you did.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/19/magazine/19-braised-black-eyed-peas/19mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course, side dish", "keywords": "black-eyed peas, mint leaves, turnip", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 144}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch baby white turnips with greens, such as Hokkaido (8 ounces)", "4 tablespoons French-style unsalted butter", "2 small red onions, diced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds fresh black-eyed peas in pods, shelled", "Fresh mint leaves, torn, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the green tops from the turnips, and cut the turnips into quarters or sixths depending on size.
