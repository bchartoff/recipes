{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beet and Lentil Salad With Cheddar", "description": "This salad is a party of sweet, earthy and salty flavors. Store-bought, vacuum-packed beets are called for here, which are not only convenient, but have a mellow fruitiness and a tender texture that is ideal in salads. (If you have fresh beets, and have the time to roast them, you can use those instead.) Beets naturally pair well with sharp and tangy ingredients, and while goat cheese may be a more common accompaniment, crumbly aged Cheddar offsets the sweetness of the beets and the apple cider dressing (though any sharp Cheddar works). French green lentils offer a nutty, peppery, almost mineral-like flavor and are perfect for salads because they hold their shape well, though if you only have brown lentils, that\u2019s just fine. (They cook slightly faster, so adjust the cook time accordingly.) Finally, there\u2019s no shame in opting for canned lentils.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/29/dining/hm-beet-salad/hm-beet-salad-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "beet, french green lentils, salad, sharp cheddar, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1306}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups French green lentils, rinsed", "1 garlic clove, smashed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 cups arugula leaves", "1/2 cup soft herbs, such as dill, parsley, mint or cilantro, roughly chopped", "1 (16-ounce) package cooked whole beets (or 1 pound roasted beets), cut into 1/2-inch wedges", "4 ounces extra sharp Cheddar, roughly crumbled", "1/4 cup roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped", "1 small garlic clove, grated", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon maple syrup or brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the salad: In a medium pot, add the lentils, garlic and 4 cups water.
