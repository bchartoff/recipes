If you can\u2019t find this type of noodle, use wide dried rice noodles: soak them for 20 minutes in warm water, then cook 1 minute in boiling water, drain and toss with 1 tablespoon oil as directed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "cabbage, noodles, shrimp, dairy-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 8}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 429, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "917 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound turnip greens or mustard greens, cleaned, thick stems discarded", "Salt to taste", "1/2 pound cabbage, cut in 3/4-inch cubes", "1/2 pound papadini (lentil/bean pasta)", "3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon peanut or canola oil", "1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce", "3/4 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons Asian red chile paste or sauce, such as sambal oelek", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1 (14-ounce) can chopped tomatoes, drained", "1/2 pound medium shrimp, shelled, cut in half lengthwise and deveined", "6 ounces bean sprouts (about 2 generous handfuls)", "1/4 cup cilantro", "1 lime, cut in wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 3 or 4 quarts water to a boil in a large pot, add about a tablespoon of salt and the greens.
