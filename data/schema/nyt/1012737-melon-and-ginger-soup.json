Smell the melons when you shop for them at the market; they should make you want to close your eyes and drink in their fragrance. If they\u2019re not really sweet, the soup will be bland. Both cantaloupe and honeydew are great sources of potassium and vitamin A.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/08/21/health/21recipehealth_600/21recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "serves four to six", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, soups and stews", "keywords": "buttermilk, melon, dessert, gluten-free, healthy, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 26, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "88 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 very ripe melons, either orange-fleshed or green, about 5 pounds, halved, seeds discarded", "2 teaspoons finely chopped or grated lime zest", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lime juice", "Pinch of salt", "1/2 cup buttermilk", "1 to 2 teaspoons ginger juice (see note), to taste", "1 tablespoon agave syrup (optional)", "Chopped fresh mint (about 1 tablespoon)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the whole melon into 8 wedges and the half into 4, and set aside two of the wedges.
