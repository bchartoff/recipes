Cold water is best for boiled dumplings because it causes the flour\u2019s proteins to form the gluten that makes dough chewy and able to withstand vigorously boiling water. Hot water denatures flour\u2019s proteins, resulting in dough supple enough to roll very thin and into tender wrappers ideal for pan-fried and steamed dumplings, such as <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021846-chile-crisp-dumplings\">chile crisp dumplings</a>. The hot water for this dough should be hotter than warm and cooler than boiling and can come from the faucet\u2019s hot tap. Letting the dough rest allows it to more fully absorb the water and relax, which will make rolling even easier.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/03/dining/01Dumplingrex2/merlin_182770524_bc13577c-7519-4a3d-a4ab-d69828ff69de-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 35 wrappers", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, dumplings, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "flour, lunar new year, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 462}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/3 cups/305 grams all-purpose flour, plus more if needed", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters hot water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the flour in a large bowl and set the bowl on a damp kitchen towel so it won\u2019t slip.
