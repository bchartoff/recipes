In this recipe, which is adapted from the \u201cSuperiority Burger Cookbook\u201d (W.W. Norton & Company, 2018) by chef Brooks Headley, extra-firm tofu is pressed, marinated, breaded and fried, to make the \u201ctofu-fried tofu\u201d sandwich at Superiority Burger, his popular vegetarian restaurant in New York City. To achieve a dense tofu patty with plenty of flavor and bite, Mr. Headley starts with extra-firm tofu, presses out any excess liquid, then marinates it in a spicy pickle juice brine. It\u2019s then double-battered and deep-fried until crisp. This sandwich is best enjoyed on a sunlit stoop in the East Village, just steps outside Superiority Burger, but it\u2019s also achievable in any home kitchen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/09/dining/aw-tofu-sandwich/aw-tofu-sandwich-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, dijon mustard, extra-firm tofu, gochugaru, plan-ahead, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3945}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained", "1 1/2 cups pickle juice", "1 tablespoon hot sauce", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon gochugaru or red-pepper flakes", "2 tablespoons grapeseed oil or other neutral oil", "1/2 cup Dijon mustard", "2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "Grapeseed oil or other neutral oil, for frying", "6 potato buns or other soft rolls", "Vegan mayonnaise and hot sauce, as needed", "Thinly shredded green cabbage and dill pickles, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the marinated tofu: Line a baking sheet with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel.
