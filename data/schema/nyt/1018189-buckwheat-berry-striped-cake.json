{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buckwheat Berry Striped Cake", "description": "A combination of buckwheat and whole wheat flour gives this deeply buttery cake a character that is nutty, rich and complex, while a little almond flour adds tenderness. Baking it in a shallow tart pan instead of a cake pan allows the colorful berries to rest on top of the batter rather than sink to the bottom. It\u2019s prettiest in a 10-inch tart pan, where the pattern will be at its most striking. But if you don\u2019t have one, a 9-inch pan also works. We arranged the berries into stripes here, but feel free to create any design you like. Serve this on the same day as you bake it, preferably within 6 hours of baking. It doesn\u2019t keep well overnight. \u00a0\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/22/multimedia/clark-berrybuckwheatcake/clark-berrybuckwheatcake-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "almond flour, berries, buckwheat flour, buttermilk, Confectioners\u2019 sugar, turbinado, whole wheat flour, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 180}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 206, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "153 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/40 grams almond flour", "1/3 cup/45 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/45 grams whole wheat flour", "1/4 cup/30 grams buckwheat flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 stick/114 grams butter, softened, more for buttering pan", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 large egg", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters buttermilk, sour cream or whole milk yogurt", "1 cup mixed berries, such as strawberries, blueberries or raspberries, more as needed", "1 tablespoon turbinado (or use granulated sugar)", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for serving", "Whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees and butter a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
