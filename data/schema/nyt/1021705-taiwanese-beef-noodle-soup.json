{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup", "description": "Flavored with warm spices, sugar and fermented broad bean chile paste, Taiwanese beef noodle soup is traditionally made with gelatinous beef shins and tendons, giving the broth a sticky richness. The flavors and technique suit meaty short ribs, which come out meltingly tender and moist. Adding a packet of powdered gelatin to the braising liquid gives it the same lip-sticking richness that braised tendons offer in the traditional version.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
