{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Scallops With Hot Sauce Beurre Blanc", "description": "This dish mixes a lot of things I love, including butter and the taste of New Orleans's Crystal hot sauce. The scallops need to be dry, a term that refers to how they are processed. It's best to sear with a very hot, heavy nonstick pan, though you can sear a scallop in stainless or cast iron. Patience and a smoking hot pan are key. Really get a good sear on the scallop before you flip it. The salsa provides a way to use the feathery tops of a fennel bulb, but tarragon or other herbs can be substituted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/24/dining/24HEATREX/24HEATREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "hot sauce, scallops, seafood, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 114}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 616, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "57 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "sodiumContent": "832 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large shallot, finely chopped", "1/4 cup finely chopped fennel fronds", "1 cup chopped cherry tomatoes", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon red wine vinegar", "1 pound large dry-processed sea scallops (about 12)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "2 tablespoons white wine", "Juice of 1 large lemon", "1/4 cup Crystal hot sauce (Frank\u2019s or Texas Pete\u2019s can be substituted; do not use Tabasco)", "2 sticks (1/2 pound) chilled butter, cut into cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the salsa:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix shallot, fennel fronds, cherry tomatoes, olive oil and vinegar in a small bowl and set aside."}]}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the scallops:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat scallops dry on both sides with a paper towel; they must be extremely dry.
