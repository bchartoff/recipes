{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Stout Cake With Coffee Glaze", "description": "This dark chocolate cake relies on stout beer to add malted notes. Coffee helps enhance the chocolate flavor, and sour cream keeps the cake moist for days. A spiked coffee glaze studded with cacao nibs lends crunch and a nice bitter edge. This recipe calls for natural-process cocoa powder, which, along with other acidic ingredients like dark brown sugar, coffee, beer and sour cream, reacts with baking soda to make the cake rise. Dutch-process cocoa is chemically neutral and should not be substituted here, as it may cause your cake to rise unevenly and could produce an unpleasant flavor. Available from speciality baking supply stores and online, black cocoa powder is also used in this recipe to enhance the dark cocoa color and flavor, but feel free to substitute more natural cocoa powder.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Laurie Ellen Pellicano"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/11/dining/LEP-chocolate-stout-cake/merlin_184806084_6e599d1e-7707-441f-a79e-a159bb24e172-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "1 (10-inch) Bundt cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "beer, cacao nibs, cocoa powder, coffee, confectioners' sugar, flour, sour cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 995}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/384 grams unbleached all-purpose flour, plus 1 tablespoon for dusting the pan", "1/2 cup/50 grams natural process cocoa powder, plus 1 tablespoon for dusting the pan", "3/4 cup/171 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), plus more for greasing the pan", "1 tablespoon baking soda", "1/4 cup/25 grams black cocoa powder (or substitute additional natural process cocoa powder)", "2 packed cups/440 grams dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon fine sea salt (depending on your preference)", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters grapeseed or other neutral oil", "1 cup/240 milliliters stout beer", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters cold-brew or strong brewed coffee", "1 cup/240 grams sour cream", "3 large eggs", "1 tablespoon whiskey", "1 3/4 cups/228 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream", "1 tablespoon whiskey", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 to 2 tablespoons cold-brew or strong brewed coffee", "1 to 2 tablespoons cacao nibs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon flour with 1 tablespoon natural process cocoa powder.
