{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Green Beans and Almond Gremolata", "description": "Celery, an underappreciated vegetable relegated to making stocks and mirepoix, rarely gets the attention it deserves. It\u2019s available in the grocery store year-round. Come late summer, it starts popping up in farmers' markets everywhere, and it deserves to shine. In this dish, its pleasantly bitter leaves are used in a unique take on gremolata, a fresh herb condiment traditionally made with Italian parsley (which you can also use here). Snappy green beans, also readily available in late summer, round out this unassuming, but impressive pasta you\u2019ll want to make again and again no matter what the season.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/dining/CH-pasta-with-green-beans-horizontal/merlin_143375034_7e70da66-c904-430a-89c7-2d9dd42eee5d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "celery, gemelli, sliced almonds, string beans, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 305}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 453, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "376 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup sliced almonds", "Scant 1/3 cup finely chopped celery leaves or parsley leaves", "1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 1 medium lemon), plus more for serving", "1 garlic clove, grated", "Kosher salt", "1 pound gemelli, campanelle or cavatappi", "3/4 pound string beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup grated Pecorino or Parmesan, plus more for serving", "Kosher salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil.
