{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Black Bean and Sweet Potato Chili", "description": "This thick, smoky vegan chili comes together in just under an hour, and most of that time is hands-off simmering. You can use any kind of sweet potato here \u2014 keep in mind that the orange or garnet \u201cyam\u201d you see at the grocery store is actually a sweet potato \u2014 but you could also switch it up and use any peeled sweet winter squash, like butternut or kabocha. The recipe calls for either coconut oil or vegetable oil. If you\u2019d like a mild coconut flavor, which plays well with the orange juice, choose unrefined or virgin coconut oil; for a neutral flavor, choose refined coconut oil or any vegetable oil. Use one chipotle chile for a very mild chili, and four if you like yours very spicy.\u00a0(Get the slow-cooker version of this recipe\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021554\">here</a>.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/14/dining/sd-black-bean-and-sweet-potato-chili/sd-black-bean-and-sweet-potato-chili-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "black beans, chipotles in adobo, corn, cumin, garlic, garlic powder, light brown sugar, onion, onion powder, orange juice, sweet potato, tomatoes, fall, winter, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1756}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup coconut oil or vegetable oil", "1 large yellow or red onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and roughly chopped", "2 packed tablespoons light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "2 teaspoons garlic powder", "2 teaspoons onion powder", "3/4 cup orange juice", "1 to 4 chipotles from a can of chipotles in adobo, finely chopped, plus 3 tablespoons adobo sauce", "1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes (4 to 5 small-medium or about 2 large), scrubbed and cut into 1-inch pieces", "2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, drained", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted", "Juice of 1 lime (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)", "1 (10-ounce) bag frozen corn", "Sliced avocado and red onion, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, warm the oil over medium-high heat.
