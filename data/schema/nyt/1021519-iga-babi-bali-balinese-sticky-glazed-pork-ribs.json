{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Iga Babi Bali (Balinese Sticky Glazed Pork Ribs)", "description": "The smell of Balinese barbecued pork ribs is a harmonious scent typically associated with trips to the picturesque island, but this recipe from the chef Lara Lee\u2019s book, \u201cCoconut & Sambal,\u201d brings the aroma to your home kitchen. Juicy, tender pork is glazed in sticky kecap manis (a sweet condiment that\u2019s typically made with palm sugar and soy sauce, commonly used throughout Indonesia and found at most Asian markets), yielding ribs that are sweet, smoky and viscid. The garlic and chile marinade packs additional heat. (Look for moderately hot red chiles, such as cayenne, that are the length and width of your index or middle finger.) Ms. Lee loves preparing the dish for dinner parties, as they can easily be made in advance and reheated (cover the ribs with foil and place in a 300 degree oven for 10 minutes). You can serve these with potato wedges or morning glory (water spinach).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kayla Stewart"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/dining/27leerex3/merlin_177925245_298f9eac-2a24-4157-bf8f-4172cea58091-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indonesian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, finger foods, meat, main course", "keywords": "ginger, palm sugar, pork, rice vinegar, shallot, spare ribs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 212}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 long red chiles (about 5 ounces), such as cayenne, trimmed, roughly chopped and deseeded, if you prefer less heat", "12 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 (5-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped", "4 shallots, preferably Thai, or 2 small banana shallots, peeled and roughly chopped", "1/2 cup rice vinegar or white wine vinegar", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon store-bought or homemade kecap manis (see Note for recipe)", "Scant 1/2 cup palm sugar or brown sugar", "1 teaspoon flaky sea salt", "2 racks (1 1/2-pound) pork spare ribs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
