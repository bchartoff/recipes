{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basic Corn Chowder", "description": "This is chowder at its simplest: corn, onion, potatoes and milk, with a couple of chopped tomatoes and a handful of parsley to add flavor and color. Starting with bacon and finishing with cream makes a richer version of the dish. But you could easily expand its borders by adding curry powder and ginger, sour cream and cilantro. Or when the potato is replaced by rice and the cream with coconut milk, Southeast Asian seasonings can be added to make a chowder that has little in common with the original, save for its intense corn flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/28/dining/28COOKING-BASIC-CORN-CHOWDER1/28COOKING-BASIC-CORN-CHOWDER1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "corn, potato, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1017}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 305, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "827 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 to 6 ears of corn", "1 tablespoon butter or neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed", "1 medium onion, chopped", "2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tomatoes, cored, seeded and chopped (optional)", "1 cup whole or low-fat milk", "1/2 cup chopped parsley (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Shuck corn, and use a paring knife to strip kernels into a bowl.
