Take a wooden cutting board or any flat platter and place several tablespoons of the dough on top. Use a large chef's knife to spread the mixture over the board so that it is about 1/8 inch thick. Hold the board over the pot of water and, using the knife, slice off strips about 1/4 inch thick and about 3 inches long. (The strips will look rough at this point, but don't be discouraged: the dumplings will take shape as they hit the water.) Dip the knife in the boiling water from time to time to make the cutting easier. When the dumplings rise to the surface, let them cook another minute before removing with a slotted spoon and dropping in a bowl of ice water."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When all the dumplings are cooked, drain in a colander.
