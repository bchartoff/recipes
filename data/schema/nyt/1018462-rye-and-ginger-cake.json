{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rye and Ginger Cake", "description": "This cake is a simple delight, a nice ending for a rich dinner or something to enhance teatime. It depends on ginger, the candied kind, though some ground ginger ramps up the cool spice flavor. The candied ginger, and also raisins, are macerated in whiskey \u2014 rye in this case, though bourbon, Scotch, or Irish or Japanese whiskey would be fine. And the whiskey contributes to a final glaze.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/07/dining/07PAIRING/07PAIRING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "crystalized ginger, golden raisins, rye whiskey, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 39}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 439, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "198 milligrams", "sugarContent": "41 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/150 grams chopped crystallized ginger", "1/2 cup/75 grams golden raisins", "2/3 cup/156 milliliters rye whiskey", "6 ounces/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened, plus butter for greasing pan", "2 cups/240 grams all-purpose flour, plus flour for pan", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 cup/213 grams light brown sugar, packed", "3 large eggs", "3 tablespoons/38 grams granulated sugar\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
