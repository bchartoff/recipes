{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet and Sour Pork", "description": "At Mamahuhu, a Chinese takeout restaurant in San Francisco, a sense of history and appreciation for American Chinese cuisine is applied to a few classics. Mining historical Cantonese sweet-and-sour dish recipes for inspiration, Brandon Jew, a founder of the restaurant, and Noah Kopito, the head chef, created a sauce that incorporates pineapple, honey and dried hawthorn berries, which impart an earthy depth of flavor. The chefs use house-fermented Fresno chiles for a hint of heat, but a dab of commercially available sambal oelek will do. This dish can be made with chicken or cauliflower instead of pork; just skip the marinade if using cauliflower.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Cathy Erway"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/23/dining/21takeoutrex1/merlin_188667921_175bd57a-3006-4733-9302-27f73f7e9e75-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, pineapple, pineapple juice, pork shoulder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 277}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/4-inch chunks", "3 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as rice bran or canola", "2 teaspoons minced ginger", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 1/4 cups rice vinegar", "1 cup pineapple juice", "3/4 cup honey", "1 tablespoon dried hawthorn berries (can be purchased in Asian groceries or online)", "2 teaspoons sambal oelek", "1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1 quart neutral oil, such as rice bran, for deep-frying", "1 bell pepper (any color), cut into 1-inch pieces", "1/2 medium yellow onion, cut into 1-inch pieces", "8 ounces fresh pineapple, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1 cup)", "Pinch of salt", "Steamed rice, for serving", "1/3 cup sweet rice flour (preferably Mochiko brand)", "1/3 cup cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper", "1/8 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pork: Combine the pork with all the marinade ingredients, mixing well.
