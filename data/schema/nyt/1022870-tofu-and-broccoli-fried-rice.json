{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tofu and Broccoli Fried Rice", "description": "Fried rice is the perfect weeknight meal: It requires minimal prep, simple pantry condiments and basic vegetables. Not to mention, it comes together quickly. Here, otherwise mild tofu is transformed into savory bites when cooked in soy sauce infused with aromatics, absorbing all of the rich, sweet-salty flavor and bringing depth to the dish. The rice seasonings are kept simple and bright with garlic and ginger, which allows the vegetables to shine. Use any mix of leftover vegetables: Cabbage, bell peppers and mushrooms are all great alternatives.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/11/dining/kc-tofu-and-broccoli-fried-rice/kc-tofu-and-broccoli-fried-rice-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, grains and rice, main course, side dish", "keywords": "broccoli, firm tofu, rice, soy sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1806}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola oil", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger", "1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce\u00a0", "2 tablespoons turbinado or granulated sugar", "1 (14-to-16-ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion", "1 large carrot, peeled and thinly sliced into rounds", "8 ounces broccoli, cut into 1-inch florets and stems thinly sliced (3 heaping cups)", "4 cups cooked and cooled long grain white rice, preferably day-old", "1 jalape\u00f1o or serrano chile, thinly sliced", "1/2 cup thawed frozen peas", "4 large eggs, beaten", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium.
