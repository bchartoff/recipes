Look for large moulard legs, available at some butcher shops and online. Here, they are served with savory mashed white beans. The beans are best cooked from scratch, but, if desired, they can be made a day or two in advance. A topping of sizzled rosemary, sage and olives brings it all together. It\u2019s a delicious dish, though somewhat rich, so a simple salad of arugula or some steamed broccoli rabe are nice as side dishes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/28Tanisrex-duck/merlin_169404567_7c011438-ab70-49bc-9f6e-bebd787cf599-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, poultry", "keywords": "duck leg, olives, rosemary, sage, white beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 40}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dry white beans, such as cannellini", "1 large onion, peeled", "2 bay leaves", "2 whole cloves", "1 head garlic (not peeled)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 large duck legs, trimmed and oven ready (about 12 to 14 ounces each)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Handful of sage leaves (from 1 small bunch)", "Handful of rosemary leaves (from 2 large sprigs)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes, to taste", "3/4 cup pitted green and black olives, halved or roughly chopped", "Arugula and lemon wedges, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the beans: Rinse beans and put them, along with the onion, bay leaves, cloves and garlic, in a large heavy-bottomed pot with a lid.
