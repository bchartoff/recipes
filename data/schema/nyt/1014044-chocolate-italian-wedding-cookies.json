{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Italian Wedding Cookies", "description": "No one knows how or why the cookie table became a wedding tradition in Pittsburgh.

Regardless of the provenance, for as long as anyone there can remember, wedding receptions have featured the tables, laden with dozens of homemade old-fashioned offerings like lady locks, pizzelles and buckeyes. These lightly-spiced chocolate-walnut cookies, part of the spread at Laura Gerrero and Luke Wiehagen's Steeltown wedding in 2009, are topped with a simple confectioners' sugar glaze and chocolate sprinkles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ron Lieber"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/17/dining/17COOKING-ITALIAN-WEDDING-COOKIES2/17COOKING-ITALIAN-WEDDING-COOKIES2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H5M", "recipeYield": "6 to 7 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, cocoa, walnut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 42}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 103, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "29 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/480 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/50 grams cocoa powder", "4 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon ground allspice", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "8 ounces (about 2 cups)/226 grams chopped walnuts", "1 cup/189 grams solid vegetable shortening", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters milk", "1 teaspoon vanilla", "2 cups/242 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3 to 5 tablespoons milk, as needed", "1/2 to 1 cup decorative sprinkles"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the cookies: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
