{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The BruniBerry", "description": "Frank Bruni, a former restaurant critic for The Times, came up with this drink at Ward III, a lounge in Tribeca that lets you choose the ingredients and qualities you want in a drink that's then custom-made for you. It's a lightly-sweet strawberry-tequila cocktail that gets a flicker of heat from the addition of jalape\u00f1o. It's got summer written all over it.\n\nKeep in mind that some jalape\u00f1o is hotter than others: it\u2019s impossible to give a measure that will assure a specific degree of heat. So if you make the following recipe, go especially light on the jalape\u00f1o the first time around, and don\u2019t overdo the ice in the shaker.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Frank Bruni"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/18/dining/BruniBerry/BruniBerry-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 cocktail", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch", "keywords": "strawberries, tequila, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 113, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 strawberries", "1 small piece jalape\u00f1o (smaller than a grape)", "\u00bc ounce honey water (half-honey, half-water)", "1\u00bd ounce tequila of choice", "\u00bd ounce fresh lime juice", "1 sprig cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Muddle strawberries.
