{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemony Mashed Potatoes With Asparagus, Almonds and Mint", "description": "Saut\u00e9ing asparagus in butter and oil, rather than boiling it in water, locks much of the flavor inside. The asparagus could be served without the lemony mashed potatoes, or the other way around, but together they make a glorious side dish to roasted chicken, fish or spring lamb. Alternatively, adding a poached egg or two to each plate will turn this into a substantial vegetarian meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/11/dining/11ottorex1/11ottorex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 side-dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "almonds, asparagus, lemon, mint, potatoes, main course, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 147}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 389, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "767 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon, preferably organic, scrubbed", "About 15 mint sprigs/40 grams plus 1/4 cup/5 grams lightly packed shredded mint leaves", "5 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 1/2 pounds/700 grams large potatoes (such as Yukon Gold or D\u00e9sir\u00e9e), peeled and cut into 1-inch/3-centimeter chunks", "3 tablespoons/50 grams unsalted butter", "1/3 cup/75 milliliters whole milk", "Heaping 1/3 cup/90 grams sour cream (soured cream)", "Salt and black pepper", "2 1/2 tablespoons/40 grams unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 3/4 pounds/800 grams asparagus, woody ends trimmed off", "6 anchovy fillets, finely sliced", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/2 cup/50 grams sliced (flaked) almonds, lightly toasted", "1 1/2 teaspoons dried mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a peeler, remove the yellow zest from the lemon in large strips.
