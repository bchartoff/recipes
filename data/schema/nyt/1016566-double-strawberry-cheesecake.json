{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Double Strawberry Cheesecake", "description": "This creamy pink dessert breaks out of the usual strawberry cheesecake mold. Instead of two distinct layers (creamy cheesecake on the bottom, bright red berries on top), the berries and cream cheese mixture are pur\u00e9ed together until smooth, silky and deeply flavored. A little red wine adds complexity and intensifies the rosy color, but feel free to use water or orange juice instead. Just don\u2019t skip the goat cheese, which tamps down the sweetness and adds a mild and pleasant earthiness to the cake without being an obvious ingredient. You can make this three days ahead; store it in the refrigerator until just before serving. It\u2019s at its best served cold.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/25/dining/strawberrycake-still/strawberrycake-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "cream cheese, goat cheese, strawberries, dessert, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 468}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 370, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "251 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "2 tablespoons/30 grams packed dark brown sugar", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters honey", "1 cup/125 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/35 grams whole-wheat flour", "1 tablespoon/7 grams unsweetened cocoa powder", "3/4 teaspoon/3 grams kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon/1 gram ground cinnamon", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters dry red wine", "1 envelope (2 1/4 teaspoons/7 grams) powdered gelatin", "1 pound/455 grams cream cheese, cut into small pieces, at room temperature", "2/3 cup/135 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/8 ounces/225 grams fresh goat cheese, broken into small pieces, at room temperature", "1 pound/455 grams fresh strawberries, hulled and coarsely chopped, plus several pretty whole or sliced strawberries for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: In the bowl of an electric mixer or a food processor, cream together butter and brown sugar until smooth, about 1 minute.
