{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Red Curry With Tofu", "description": "This simple weeknight red curry relies on jarred or canned red curry paste for flavor, which you can find at larger supermarkets and specialty markets. Transfer leftover canned curry paste to a jar, top it with a little oil and store in the refrigerator for up to a month. Or freeze for longer storage. Feel free to substitute other vegetables for the mushrooms and snow peas, though you might have to increase the cooking time slightly if using something dense like carrot or cubed winter squash.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/11/dining/mc-coconut-red-curry-with-tofu/mc-coconut-red-curry-with-tofu-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1214}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 281, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "561 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 ounces extra-firm tofu", "1 tablespoon peanut or safflower oil", "1-inch ginger root, peeled and minced", "2 shallots or 1 small onion, minced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 Thai chile or 2 serrano peppers, seeded and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro stems", "8 ounces cremini mushrooms, quartered", "1/2 teaspoon sea salt, more to taste", "3 tablespoons prepared red curry paste", "1 cup unsweetened coconut milk", "2 teaspoons Asian fish sauce", "Zest and juice of 1 lime", "1 cup snow peas", "Basil and/or cilantro leaves, for garnish", "Brown or white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut tofu into 1-inch slabs and place on paper towel-lined baking sheet.
