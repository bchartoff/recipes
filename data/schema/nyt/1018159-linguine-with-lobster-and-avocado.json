{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Linguine With Lobster and Avocado", "description": "The summer season was beginning, whetting the appetite for a copious seafood salad or a tangy ceviche. But instead, I tore a page from ceviche\u2019s playbook and assembled a pasta dish with the avocado, tomato, jalape\u00f1o, scallion, cilantro and citrus juice, along with lobster, to mingle with pasta. The result was brightly fresh-tasting, a warm-weather charmer with a touch of spice. Even during the brief cooking, some of the avocado will melt into the mixture, suavely coating the strands of linguine. But be sure that some of the avocado is still intact. The dish is satisfying as the main event yet light enough to serve as a first course followed by chicken or sausages hot off the grill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/08/dining/08PAIRING-WEB/08PAIRING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 first-course servings, 2 to 3 as a main course", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, avocado, jalape\u00f1o, linguine, lobster, tomatoes", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 232}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 515, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "841 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ripe avocado, peeled, pitted, cut in 1/2-inch dice", "Juice of 1 lemon", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and ground white pepper", "8 ounces linguine", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "1 small jalape\u00f1o chile, seeded and minced", "8 ounces grape tomatoes, halved", "1 1 1/4-pound cooked lobster, meat removed and diced", "2 scallions, chopped", "2 tablespoons minced cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Thoroughly mix avocado and lemon juice in a bowl.
