In Ireland, soda bread tends to be plainer and more restrained. Here is a classic recipe adapted from Darina Allen, an Irish television personality and the owner of the Ballymaloe Cookery School in Shanagarry. This soda bread is is best eaten still steaming from the oven, slathered with good salted Irish butter that melts on contact with your slice. It\u2019s a fine accompaniment to corned beef and cabbage, should you be making that dish this St. Paddy\u2019s Day. Or make this recipe all year long. That\u2019s how they do it in Ireland.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/09/dining/01COOKING-IRISH-SODA-BREAD3/01COOKING-IRISH-SODA-BREAD3-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 loaf, 8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy", "keywords": "baking soda, flour, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 789}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 174, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "188 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["450 grams all-purpose flour (about 3 1/2 cups)", "3 grams fine sea salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)", "4 grams baking soda (about 3/4 teaspoon)", "1 1/2 cups buttermilk, more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
