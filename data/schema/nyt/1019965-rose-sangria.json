This rosy riff on sangria, which is loaded with red and pink fruit for a festive, crowd-friendly treat. Be sure to plan ahead: The fruit needs to macerate for at least 4 hours to soak up the flavors and to soften. For the wine, choose a ros\u00e9 that is neither too sweet nor too dry. It should taste good to you on its own, but since it will be mingling with juice, liquor and a whole lot of fruit, go with something inexpensive.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/29/dining/rs-rose-sangria/merlin_149034735_8828a8ab-50c3-4cf5-8538-8d1a7b60d891-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, fruit, pomegranate juice, ros\u00e9, triple sec", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 165}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 179, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "10 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups mixed red and pink fruit of your choice (raspberries, halved strawberries and grapes, cubed apple with red or pink skin, peeled pink grapefruit and blood orange sections, pomegranate seeds)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 cup triple sec", "2 (750-milliliter) bottles ros\u00e9 wine, chilled", "1 cup pomegranate juice, chilled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the fruit, sugar and triple sec in a pitcher and stir to combine; let rest in the refrigerator until fruit softens and absorbs flavors, at least 4 and up to 8 hours.
