Freezing milk in an ice cube tray gives you a similar creamy consistency to the version at Molly\u2019s, which contains no ice. Brandy provides a mellower flavor than Irish whiskey, but feel free to substitute whiskey for the brandy if you prefer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/13/dining/sb-new-irish-coffee/sb-new-irish-coffee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "brandy, coffee, coffee liqueur, milk, vanilla ice cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 71}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup vanilla ice cream", "1 1/4 cups whole milk, frozen in an ice cube tray", "4 ounces strong coffee or cold brew, chilled", "2 ounces brandy", "2 ounces coffee liqueur", "1/4 teaspoon fresh coffee grounds, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add ice cream, frozen milk cubes, chilled coffee, brandy and coffee liqueur to a blender.
