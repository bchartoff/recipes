{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Pork Stew With Garam Masala", "description": "Coconut milk adds richness and a gentle creamy sweetness to this hearty pork stew, while garam masala, cumin, and cayenne add fragrance and a jolt of spice. Because yellow split peas are cooked along with the pork, you don\u2019t necessarily need to serve this over another starch, making it a warming one-pot meal. However, a side of rice will tame the heat if you\u2019re looking for a slightly mellower meal. And if you want to cool this down even further, substitute mild chiles for the hot ones called for in the garlic coconut oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/02/dining/02APPE/02APPE-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "one pot, soups and stews", "keywords": "coconut milk, coconut oil, garam masala, pork butt, yellow split peas, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 633}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 440, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "584 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds boneless pork butt (fat trimmed), or pork stew meat, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne", "1/2 cup dried yellow split peas", "2 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 cinnamon stick", "6 cloves garlic, minced", "1 serrano or jalape\u00f1o pepper, minced", "1 26- to 28-ounce can or package diced tomatoes", "1 cup coconut milk, solids and liquid whisked together", "Chopped cilantro, for garnish", "1/3 cup coconut oil", "1 teaspoon mustard seeds", "6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "3 hot red or green chiles, halved lengthwise, seeds scraped out with a spoon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the pork with the cumin, salt, garam masala and cayenne.
