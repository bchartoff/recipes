{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sous-Vide Salmon With Caper-Parsley Vinaigrette", "description": "Cooking salmon using a sous-vide machine produces the most buttery, flavorful fish imaginable. In this recipe, the fish is slathered with herbs before cooking, then topped with a caper-studded vinaigrette. You have two choices for preparing the salmon: One is to slightly undercook the fish, then sear it on a grill or under the broiler to crisp up the skin. The second is to cook it in the sous-vide machine until it\u2019s perfectly done, and serve it while soft and satiny all the way through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/05/dining/05sousviderex3/merlin_157351155_229b4eae-24ea-48bc-95fb-15f215b978dc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, seafood", "keywords": "dill frond, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 129}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 1/2-pound) boneless, skin-on side of salmon,\u00a0cut into 4 pieces crosswise", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "Fine sea salt, as needed", "1/4 cup fresh dill fronds", "1/4 cup packed fresh parsley sprigs", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing (optional)", "1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion or shallot", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley", "2 tablespoons finely chopped drained capers", "2 small garlic cloves, finely grated or mashed to a paste", "2 scallions, white and green parts only, thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste", "3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place salmon pieces skin-side down on a rimmed baking sheet.
