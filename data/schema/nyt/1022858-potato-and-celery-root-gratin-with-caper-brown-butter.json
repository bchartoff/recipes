{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato and Celery Root Gratin With Caper Brown Butter", "description": "This is the perfect side dish to a Sunday roast or winter spread. Cutting the vegetables into batons as opposed to thinly slicing them lends a wonderful texture to the dish, and it looks pretty funky too.
