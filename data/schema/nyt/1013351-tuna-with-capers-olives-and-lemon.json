{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tuna With Capers, Olives and Lemon", "description": "This is not your mother's mayonnaise-laden tuna salad, but it's just as easy to prepare. Here's what you do: stir together some canned tuna, garlic, lemon juice, red onion, black olives, capers and fresh parsley, then spread it on buttered toast. Top it off with a round of ripe tomato or slivers of avocado and another slice of toast. That's it. If you want to make it into a dip, toss the mixture into a food processor with a few tablespoons of softened butter and a bit more olive oil. Pur\u00e9e until smooth and creamy and serve with carrots, fennel, bell pepper and seeded crackers. If you have a tin of sardines taunting you from inside your cabinet, we bet this recipe would work equally well with those.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/dining/tuna-dip/tuna-dip-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches or 8 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, quick, weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, canned tuna", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 522}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 273, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "228 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 garlic clove, finely minced", "Juice of half a lemon, plus more to taste", "5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus 4 more tablespoons if serving as dip", "20 ounces canned tuna, preferably packed in olive oil, drained", "1/4 cup chopped red onion", "1/4 cup chopped black olives", "2 tablespoons capers", "2 tablespoons minced parsley or basil", "Salt to taste", "Buttered toast, if serving as sandwiches", "10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, if serving as dip"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, mash garlic with the back of a spoon.
