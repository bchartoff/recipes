{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Eggs With Beans and Greens", "description": "Consider this a heartier version of the classic Italian dish \u201ceggs in purgatory,\u201d which works well for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It\u2019s also very forgiving. If you\u2019d rather keep this a vegetarian meal, skip the sausage. No chickpeas? No problem. Any white bean will work well in its place. Same with the greens. Use what you have (anything that wilts works). Sprinkling the dish with grated cheese before serving is not required, but it sure does taste good. Serve with thick slices of toasted sesame bread slathered with plenty of softened butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/01/dining/ch-sausage-beans-greens-eggs/merlin_144807984_cbb42ddb-6453-4ff0-88e7-f9d4261b5c78-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, weekday, weeknight, sausages", "keywords": "chickpea, eggs, greens, italian sausage, tomatoes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 522}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "702 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 pound sweet or spicy Italian sausage, casings removed (optional)", "1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas or white beans, drained and rinsed", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "Kosher salt", "1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, gently crushed by hand", "4 cups stemmed and packed roughly chopped greens such as spinach, kale or Swiss chard", "6 large eggs", "Black pepper", "2 tablespoons mixed herbs, such as Italian parsley and basil, for garnish", "Grated cheese, such as pecorino or Parmesan, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
