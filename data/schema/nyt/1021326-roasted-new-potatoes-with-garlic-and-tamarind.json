{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted New Potatoes With Garlic and Tamarind", "description": "In this recipe, roasted potatoes are paired with classic flavors used in Western and Indian cooking: butter and garlic, the fruity acidity of tamarind and lime juice, and the sweetness of date syrup. The potatoes are sliced and cooked in a pot of salted water, which helps them develop a thin crust and creamy interior when roasted. They make a great side to almost any meal, and can easily take the place of a breakfast hash. The shallots here carry a milder bite, but a red onion can be substituted for a stronger taste. Do stick to tamarind paste, and avoid using thick, syrupy tamarind concentrates. They lack tamarind\u2019s fruitiness and carry a noticeable artificial aftertaste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10tamarindrex2-potatoes/10tamarindrex2-potatoes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "green chili, potato, shallot, tamarind, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 340}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds yellow new potatoes, about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in width", "Kosher salt", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and grated", "2 tablespoons <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021264-tamarind-paste\">tamarind paste</a> (not concentrate)", "1 tablespoon date syrup, honey or maple syrup", "1 teaspoon lime juice", "1 medium shallot, peeled and minced", "2 scallions, white and green parts thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro", "1 green chile, such as a serrano or Thai chile, minced (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees and place a rack in the top third of the oven."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Scrub the potatoes under running water to remove any grit or dirt.
