{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Roasted Turkish Lamb", "description": "This lamb must be cooked until completely tender and succulent, but if time is a concern, it may also be prepared well in advance and reheated in the pan juices to serve. Shoulder is the best cut to use, or lamb shanks. It\u2019s finished with a bright garnish of pomegranate seeds and sliced persimmons. Small Fuyu persimmons are delicious eaten firm and raw, like an apple, unlike the larger Hachiya type, which must be ripe and soft to be palatable (and would not be suitable here). Lacking persimmons, use more pomegranate. Serve it with rice pilaf, if desired.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/06/dining/01Tanisrex2/merlin_163467744_8958bd0d-5c05-4300-9820-8fdcff5839fd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "turkish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "lamb, persimmon, pomegranate molasses, rosemary, thyme, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 123}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3- to 4-pound) boneless lamb shoulder, trimmed of excess fat", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon Maras pepper or regular red-pepper flakes (optional)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 small lemon)", "2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses (optional)", "2 large thyme sprigs", "1 small rosemary sprig", "4 bay leaves", "8 garlic cloves, unpeeled", "1 small onion, peeled and halved", "3 or 4 firm Fuyu persimmons, peeled and sliced (optional)", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds (optional)", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley, some leaves reserved", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped mint, some leaves reserved", "1 medium lemon, cut into wedges", "Plain yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
