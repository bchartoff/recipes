{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesecake-Chocolate Pudding Bars", "description": "You may know it as chocolate delight or chocolate lush, but while this dessert has many names, the recipe rarely varies. Traditionally, it starts with a salty nut base, followed by a mixture of cream cheese and Cool Whip, a layer of boxed-mix chocolate pudding, and then even more Cool Whip. This from-scratch version starts with a crumbly pecan shortbread, which adds texture and salt. The homemade pudding tastes of deep, dark chocolate and serves as the perfect contrast to the simple no-bake cheesecake layer. Gilding the lily with freshly whipped cream and chocolate shavings isn\u2019t imperative, but it certainly takes it to another level.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/06/dining/ss-cheesecake-chocolate-pudding-bars/ss-cheesecake-chocolate-pudding-bars-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H30M", "recipeYield": "9 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bar cookie, chocolate, cream cheese, whipped cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 525}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup/86 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/80 grams finely chopped pecans", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "5 tablespoons/76 grams unsalted butter, melted\u00a0", "8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/62 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/187 milliliters cold heavy cream", "3 ounces/85 grams bittersweet or semisweet bar chocolate, chopped", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/75 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons cocoa powder", "3 tablespoons cornstarch\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups/375 milliliters whole milk", "3 large egg yolks", "1 cup/250 milliliters cold heavy cream", "1 tablespoon confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Chocolate shavings (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
