{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Endive, Apple and Kasha Salad", "description": "Nutty, earthy grains of kasha go beautifully with crunchy, juicy apples and bitter endive, long a favorite salad combo. Cut the apple into small dice \u2013 1/4 to 1/2 inch \u2013 to maximize this marriage of grain, fruit, nut and bitter salad green. The acid to oil quotient in the dressing is on the low side; I use lemon juice only and sweeten the mix with a little honey. You could also use agave nectar, and leave out the Gruy\u00e8re in the salad for a vegan version; though I love the Gruy\u00e8re here because it, too, has a nutty flavor. This salad holds up well on a buffet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/07/science/receiphealthapple/receiphealthapple-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, spring, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 274, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "289 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 good-size crisp apple, cored and cut into small dice", "1 tablespoon fresh lime or lemon juice", "4 Belgian endives, sliced", "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017205-kasha\">1 cup cooked kasha</a>", "1/3 cup broken walnuts", "1 ounce Gruy\u00e8re, cut in small dice", "1 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (to taste)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice", "1 to 2 teaspoons honey or agave nectar (to taste)", "Salt to taste", "freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons walnut oil", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large salad bowl, toss together apple and lime or lemon juice.
