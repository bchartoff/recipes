{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smashed Avocado-Chicken Burgers", "description": "These zippy chicken burgers are loaded with ginger, garlic, cilantro and scallions for fresh flavor and some textural crunch. The secret ingredient is a little mashed avocado that\u2019s added to the ground chicken before cooking, which keeps the burgers tender and light. A citrusy soy mayonnaise is used both inside the patties and slathered on top. (Fish sauce could be used in place of the soy. Decrease the amount and adjust to taste.) Kewpie is a Japanese mayonnaise made with rice wine vinegar and egg yolks rather than distilled vinegar and whole eggs, but you can just as easily use your preferred mayonnaise. Fresh jalape\u00f1os offer a satisfying crunch when biting into the burger, though pickled ones could be used for extra acidity.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/18/dining/yf-chicken-avocado-burgers/merlin_205536372_0d3102af-f082-4900-bfd2-176105d53a42-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "avocado, cilantro, ground chicken", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1236}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup Kewpie or other mayonnaise", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1 lime, cut into wedges", "Kosher salt", "1 packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped, plus more for serving", "1/4 cup mashed, ripe Hass avocado (from about \u00bd avocado; slice the other half for serving) (see Tip)", "2 scallions, light green and white parts only, thinly sliced", "3 large garlic cloves, grated or minced", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger, grated or minced (about 2 teaspoons)", "1/4 to \u00bd teaspoon red-pepper flakes, according to taste", "1 pound ground chicken, preferably dark meat", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola oil, or ghee", "4 brioche or burger buns, lightly toasted", "Butter lettuce or other tender lettuce, for serving", "1 jalape\u00f1o, thinly sliced, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small serving bowl, combine the mayonnaise and soy sauce.
