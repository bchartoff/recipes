{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peppers Stuffed With Rice, Zucchini and Herbs", "description": "I used a medium-grain rice that I buy at my local Iranian market for these peppers. The package says that the rice is great for stuffing vegetables because it doesn\u2019t swell too much, and it\u2019s right. It goes into the peppers uncooked and steams in the oven, inside the peppers (so it\u2019s important to cook them long enough and cover the baking dish). Make sure that you spoon the sauce left in the baking dish over the rice once the peppers are done. These are good hot or at room temperature. I like to use green peppers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/15/science/16recipehealth/16recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, green pepper, rice, zucchini, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 57}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 268, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "558 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 medium peppers, preferably green", "2 medium zucchini (about 3/4 pound), shredded", "Salt to taste", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh mint", "1/4 cup chopped fresh dill or parsley", "1 scant cup uncooked medium grain rice", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons tomato paste dissolved in 2/3 cup water", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the peppers.
