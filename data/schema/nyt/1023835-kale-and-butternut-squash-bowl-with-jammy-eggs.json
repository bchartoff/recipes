In this recipe, you don\u2019t need a steamer basket for either. Cook the eggs in a covered skillet or pot of shallow boiling water, then layer winter squash, broccoli or cauliflower and dark leafy greens. The small amount of water will produce ample steam to cook the vegetables. Eat with plenty of sesame seeds for crunch and a yogurt sauce that is nutty from sesame oil and bright with lemon and ginger. The sauce is endlessly adaptable; add fresh or dried herbs or chile, ground or toasted spices, toasted coconut and more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/18/multimedia/as-butternut-squash-and-kale-bowl-bmvh/as-butternut-squash-and-kale-bowl-bmvh-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, lunch, weeknight, one pot, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "broccoli, butternut squash, cauliflower, egg, kale, make-ahead, sesame oil, sesame seeds, yogurt, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 36}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large eggs", "3/4 cup plain, full-fat yogurt", "1 teaspoon lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons juice (from 1 lemon)", "2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "Salt", "12 ounces butternut, honeynut or kabocha squash, seeds removed and sliced 1/2-inch thick", "8 ounces broccoli, cauliflower or a combination, cut into 1-inch florets and stems, thinly sliced", "4 ounces (about 4 packed cups) torn kale leaves, or another hearty green like chard or mustard", "Toasted sesame seeds (any color), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) skillet with a lid or a large Dutch oven, bring 1 inch of water to a boil over high.
