He prepares bass and bluefish with recipes from his days cooking for crewmates on long dragger trips.\n\nFor these bluefish fillets, you may wonder if all the toppings overwhelm the flavor of this dish. Though hardly Le Bernardin (or the American Heart Association, for that matter), fear not, as the mayo and melted cream cheese offset the oiliness of the fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brett Martin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/04/dining/Barbecued-Bluefish/Barbecued-Bluefish-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "bluefish, fish, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 607, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "672 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds fillets of bluefish or, if preferred, mackerel", "Kosher salt to taste", "Ground black pepper to taste", "Extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, sliced very thin", "1 medium tomato, sliced thin", "1 tablespoon mayonnaise", "1 1/2-inch by 3-inch by 1/4-inch slab of cream cheese, broken into small pieces", "1 lemon, halved, one half left intact and the other sliced thin", "1 tablespoon butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start grill or preheat oven to 450 degrees.
