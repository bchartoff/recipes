Rum extract, widely available during the holidays, is the secret to replicating that classic eggnog flavor. An extra egg yolk in the dough and a dusting of nutmeg-sugar yield a cookie that\u2019s custard-like on the inside and crisp on the outside. These are even better the second day, and keep very well in an airtight container at room temperature. This season, forgo the eggnog altogether and enjoy these cookies with a bourbon neat.\u00a0(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQDNDcpgPe4\">Watch Vaughn Vreeland make his Eggnog Snickerdoodles.</a>)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vaughn Vreeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/08/dining/vv-eggnog-snickerdoodles/merlin_180932622_5500478d-7ab0-4478-921d-d87cd79d6797-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "christmas, christmas cookie, cream of tartar, make-ahead, nutmeg, rum extract, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2167}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 cups/445 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 3/4 cup/350 grams granulated sugar, plus 1/4 cup/50 grams for rolling", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 large egg plus 2 yolks, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon rum extract", "2 teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar and baking soda, and set aside.
