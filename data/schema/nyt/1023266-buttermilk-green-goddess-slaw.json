{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttermilk Green Goddess Slaw", "description": "This herby coleslaw variation was adapted from \u201cThe Animal Farm Buttermilk Cookbook\u201d (Andrews McMeel Publishing, 2013) by Diane St. Clair. In it, a tangy buttermilk- and avocado-spiked green goddess dressing takes the place of the usual mayonnaise mix, for a slaw that\u2019s both lighter and fresher tasting. Like most coleslaws, it gets better as it sits so, if you have time, plan to make it a few hours ahead. Save any extra dressing to use as a dip for cut vegetables or for other salads. It will keep for up to two days in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/13dairyrex1-slaw/merlin_206514669_228cda92-d76d-4410-a733-d71806232575-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings, slaws, side dish", "keywords": "avocado, cabbage, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 490}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ripe avocado, pitted and cubed", "3/4 cup buttermilk", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice", "2 oil-packed anchovy fillets", "2 scallions, sliced", "1 garlic clove, peeled and smashed", "1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves and tender stems", "3 tablespoons chopped chives", "2 tablespoons chopped tarragon leaves", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon chopped basil leaves", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "4 cups thinly sliced green cabbage (about 1/2 a small head)", "4 scallions, thinly sliced", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded, if desired, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: Put avocado, buttermilk, lemon juice, anchovy, scallions, garlic, parsley, chives, tarragon, olive oil and basil in a food processor or blender, and process until smooth and uniformly green, 1 to 2 minutes.
