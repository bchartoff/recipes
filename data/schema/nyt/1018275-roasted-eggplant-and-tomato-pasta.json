{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Eggplant and Tomato Pasta", "description": "This summery pasta is just as much about the vegetables as it is about the pasta itself. The star of the dish is the roasted eggplant, which caramelizes and softens in the oven. Those tender browned cubes then get tossed with cooked pasta and a quickly made sauce of fresh grated tomatoes, capers and chile flakes. Because the tomatoes need to be ripe and soft enough to fall into a pur\u00e9e when you rub the cut sides over the holes of a grater, heirloom tomatoes (which haven\u2019t been bred for sturdiness during shipping) are a good choice here. But any juicy, flavorful, fleshy tomatoes will work. The cheese at the end is strictly optional, as is the butter. If you don\u2019t eat dairy, feel free to leave them out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/01/multimedia/clark-eggplant-tomato/clark-eggplant-tomato-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "banana pepper, capers, eggplant, pasta, tomato, main course, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 729}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 275, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "57 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "834 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 pounds eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 to 2 banana or Italian frying peppers, halved, seeded and thinly sliced", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "Kosher salt", "12 ounces pasta, such as campanelle or farfalle", "2 pounds very ripe heirloom tomatoes, halved through their equators", "1 to 2 fat garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced", "Large pinch crushed red pepper flakes", "2 tablespoons brine-packed capers, drained", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter (optional)", "Grated ricotta salata or Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)", "Fresh mint or basil leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
