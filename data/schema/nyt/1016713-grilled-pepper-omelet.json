{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Pepper Omelet", "description": "Roasted peppers, chopped herbs and a little bit of Parmesan make for a quick omelet in the spirit of a pip\u00e9rade.\nI often make the classic Basque pip\u00e9rade, eggs scrambled with stewed peppers and tomatoes. This time, I kept it a little simpler and used my roasted peppers to fill an omelet. I added chopped, fresh herbs and a little bit of Parmesan to the mix. If your peppers are already roasted (I had plenty on hand as I\u2019d been working with roasted peppers all week) this is a 2- to 5-minute dinner. As always, the better the eggs (farm-fresh, pastured), the better the omelet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/05/science/07recipehealth/07recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "french, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, fall, summer, gluten-free, halal, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 303, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "504 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 1/3 cup chopped or sliced roasted peppers (about 3 ounces)", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 to 3 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley, thyme, marjoram or basil (optional)", "2 large or extra-large eggs", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 teaspoons milk (optional)", "2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons freshly grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make sure peppers are nicely seasoned.
