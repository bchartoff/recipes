There are two key steps to the bread\u2019s texture: The first is a tangzhong, or \u201cwater roux,\u201d which originated in Japanese baking but was popularized throughout Asia and beyond by the Taiwanese pastry chef Yvonne Chen. The second is a long, slow mix that develops sufficient strength in the dough to support a lofty rise in the oven. Unless you have superhuman strength and patience, a stand mixer is required. The dough is slightly sweet, making it ideal for cinnamon rolls or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022249-pistachio-morning-buns\">pistachio morning buns</a>, and suitable for sandwich bread or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022247-hamburger-buns\">hamburger buns</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Claire Saffitz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/26/dining/21yeastedrex1-bread/merlin_187925100_9089549f-03af-4bb2-8001-3a238b7d22f0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H45M", "recipeYield": "2 loaves", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads, project", "keywords": "active dry yeast, egg, milk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 759}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 grams whole milk or buttermilk", "6 tablespoons/50 grams plus 3 3/4 cups/490 grams all-purpose flour, plus more, if needed, for work surface", "5 large eggs, chilled", "2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "10 grams kosher salt (2 3/4 teaspoons Diamond Crystal or 1 1/2 teaspoons Morton)", "2 teaspoons/6 grams active dry yeast", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 1/2-inch pieces, chilled, plus more, at room temperature, for pans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the tangzhong: Combine the milk and 6 tablespoons flour in a medium saucepan and whisk until smooth.

Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a bowl scraper or flexible spatula, then mix on medium-low, scraping down the sides once or twice more, until dough is smooth, firm and very elastic, 12 to 15 minutes.

Add half of the chilled butter pieces and mix on low speed until the butter pieces have incorporated into the dough, about 5 minutes.

You can also do a windowpane test: Pinch off a golf ball-size piece of dough, and use your thumbs to flatten it and work the dough outward into a thin layer. Slowly stretch the dough, until it forms a thin membrane through which light can pass. If it tears before that point, or as it falls from the hook, continue to mix on medium-low and repeat the test every 5 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Let the dough rise: Scrape the dough onto a work surface.

Drag your hand \u2014 and the dough with it \u2014 slowly across the surface, moving it in small, rapid circles. The friction between the dough and the surface will help tighten the dome so your loaves rise upward. You shouldn\u2019t need to add flour, since the cold dough is easier to handle and much less sticky, but if your dough is slightly warm or otherwise sticky, add just a bit of flour to make it easier to handle.
