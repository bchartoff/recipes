Here's what you do: As the spaghetti boils, simmer some green peas with a little water until they're hot (or just dump the frozen peas in with the boiling pasta a couple minutes before the timer is set to ding). Drain the pasta and return to the pot with a button of butter. Add peas, prosciutto and cream and toss to coat. Season well with salt, pepper and grated Parmesan. Toss some more. Serve and swoon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alex Witchel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/29/dining/Pleasant-Pasta/Pleasant-Pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, pastas", "keywords": "frozen peas, prosciutto, spaghetti, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 756}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 896, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "97 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "1871 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1 pound spaghetti", "1 10-ounce package frozen peas", "4 tablespoons butter", "1/2 pound thinly sliced prosciutto di Parma, rolled up and cut in 1/4-inch-wide strips", "2/3 cup heavy cream", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 to 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese; more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
