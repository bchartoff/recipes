{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken With White Beans and Caramelized Lemon", "description": "One of the best parts of cooking skin-on chicken in a skillet, aside from the obvious (crispy skin), is the delicious fat left behind. To maximize the amount of fat yielded, be sure to cook the chicken on the medium side of medium-high heat, which gives the fat plenty of time to render before the skin browns. All this extra time on the stove means you won\u2019t have to finish your chicken in the oven. (The only exception are extra-large pieces, which may need a brief stint in a 350-degree oven to completely cook through.) While just about anything is great tossed in this liquid gold, using it to caramelize thick slices of lemon and wedges of shallot takes the dish to an even more complex, savory, tangy place. You can let the seasons or your pantry dictate what gets added next: hearty leafy greens, chunks of summer squash or a simple can of chickpeas or beans are all welcome to the party.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/25/dining/25Roman6-copy/25Roman6-copy-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thighs, kale, lemon, white beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1610}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 822, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "51 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "57 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1103 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon, thinly sliced, seeds removed", "1 shallot, peeled and cut into thin wedges", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs or breasts (about 4 to 6)", "1 tablespoon canola oil", "1 (15-ounce) can small white beans (such as Great Northern, navy or cannellini) or chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1 bunch kale, ribs removed, leaves torn into large pieces", "Flaky sea salt", "Olive oil, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss lemon slices and shallots together in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper; set aside.
