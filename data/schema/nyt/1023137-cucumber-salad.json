If using slicing cucumbers \u2014 the slightly thicker ones you\u2019ll find with seeds and sometimes waxier-seeming skins \u2014 you might want to peel them first and remove the seeds, which can dilute the dressing. To seed, simply halve the cucumbers lengthwise and use a teaspoon to gently scrape out the seeds. Feel free to play around with shapes, too. Slicing the cucumbers into rounds is easy enough, but half moons or other bite-size pieces are also welcome.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/dining/dp-cucumber-salad/dp-cucumber-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings, side dish", "keywords": "buttermilk, cucumber, poppy seeds, salad, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 308}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup buttermilk\u00a0", "3 tablespoons whole-milk plain or Greek yogurt\u00a0", "3 tablespoons lemon juice\u00a0", "1 1/2 tablespoons poppy seeds", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds cucumbers, thinly sliced\u00a0", "4 scallions, green and white parts, thinly sliced\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together buttermilk, yogurt, lemon juice, poppy seeds, salt and pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add cucumbers and scallions and toss to combine.
