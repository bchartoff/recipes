{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Baked Fish With Tartar Sauce", "description": "Charming fish shacks and salty sea air aren\u2019t a weeknight possibility for most of us, but thankfully, this recipe is. It features a clever technique from recipe developer Molly Kreuger: Creamy tartar sauce is spread on the fish to add flavor, keep the fillets moist during cooking and help the bread crumbs adhere to the fish. (Feel free to use your favorite tartar sauce in place of the one below.) The fish is baked until nearly cooked through, then broiled to toast the breadcrumb topping. The end result is crispy, creamy, tangy and moist, all of which is achieved without having to deal with a big pot of oil. Eat with more tartar sauce and a squeeze of lemon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/17/dining/as-oven-baked-fish/merlin_188895618_496972ec-76eb-4cf1-91fc-895ac13b1fdf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "bread crumbs, capers, fish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1110}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup mayonnaise", "5 tablespoons capers, drained and coarsely chopped", "1/4 cup finely chopped pickles (such as cornichons or half sour)", "2 tablespoons finely chopped tarragon, dill or parsley", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire or soy sauce", "1 small garlic clove", "1 large lemon", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing", "4 (6-ounce) thick white fish fillets, such as halibut or cod (skin on or off)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the upper part.
