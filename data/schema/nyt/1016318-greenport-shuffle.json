{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Greenport Shuffle", "description": "This recipe is a modification of that great Caribbean libation the Painkiller, born at the Soggy Dollar Bar on Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgin Islands. The Painkiller features dark rum over shaved ice, frothed with orange and pineapple juice along with some sweetened coconut cream, topped with a shaving of nutmeg. It is rich stuff, a little complicated, a bit much for a long Saturday night of drinking under sea grape and palms. This version whittles down the ingredients for reasons of both thrift and flavor, and can be counted a minimalist take on the classic. It was developed on the east end of Long Island by Capt. David Berson of <i>Glory</i>, and is called the Greenport Shuffle, for its eventual effect on one\u2019s gait.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/02/dining/Greenport/Greenport-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 cocktail", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "nutmeg, pineapple juice, rum, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces aged rum", "6 ounces pineapple juice", "Freshly grated nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place crushed ice in a cocktail glass, and pour rum and pineapple juice over it.
