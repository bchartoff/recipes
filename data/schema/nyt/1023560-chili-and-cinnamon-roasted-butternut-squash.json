{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chili- and Cinnamon-Roasted Butternut Squash", "description": "Roasting butternut squash at a high temperature helps the sugars caramelize, bringing out a sweetness that pairs perfectly with fall flavors like cinnamon and cayenne. This recipe plays on the duality of butternut squash \u2013 its savory and sweet components. The ground cinnamon complements the caramelization, and the chili powder and cayenne play on the vegetable\u2019s more savory profile. The cayenne also adds a kick, though you can omit it if you prefer to keep this dish\u2019s heat limited to the more subtle chili powder.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/18/dining/vl-butternut-squash1/vl-butternut-squash1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "butternut squash, chili powder, ground cinnamon, fall, winter, healthy, vegan, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 418}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium butternut squash (about 2 pounds), peeled, seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt-free chili powder", "Kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
