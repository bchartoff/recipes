{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Casserole", "description": "This take on a classic Thanksgiving sweet potato casserole recipe has the right amount of sweetness and irresistible buttery flavor, not to mention a good balance of creamy and crunchy. Crushed cornflakes make the topping extra crisp, but you can skip them if you want. The two cups of mini marshmallows called for may not cover your entire casserole, allowing a little of that sweet potato filling to peek out, but feel free to use more marshmallows to cover it all the way (and look for gelatin-free ones to keep this dish strictly vegetarian). With all its flavors and textures combined, this quintessential holiday dish will have everyone coming back for more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/dining/mp-sweet-potato-casserole/mp-sweet-potato-casserole-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "butter, cornflakes, sweet potato, sweetened condensed milk, fall, winter, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1887}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "6 large sweet potatoes (about 4 pounds), scrubbed", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup finely chopped pecans", "1 cup lightly crushed cornflakes (optional)", "1/2 packed cup light or dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted", "2 cups mini marshmallows, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the filling: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
