{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cinnamon Raisin Swirl Bread", "description": "You can use any white bread recipe to make any swirl breads listed below. The cinnamon raisin version is a classic, inspired by a recipe from James Beard. The sherry gives an unusual complexity to the sweet raisins and brown sugar, and most of the alcohol is cooked off while the mixture simmers. Feel free to use apple cider instead. This recipe makes two loaves, one to eat right away, preferably warm from the oven, or toasted and buttered the next day. Freeze the other loaf and use it to make what is arguably the best French toast imaginable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/21/multimedia/clark-rasin-bread/clark-rasin-bread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H15M", "recipeYield": "2 loaves", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, breads", "keywords": "active dry yeast, cider, cinnamon, dark brown sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 283}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 301, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "245 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 teaspoons/7 grams active dry yeast (1 package)", "1 1/2 cups/355 grams lukewarm milk", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon/15 grams kosher salt", "3 tablespoons/43 grams butter, melted, more for greasing bowl and pans", "2 eggs", "5 to 6 cups/625 grams to 750 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/79 milliliters dry sherry or apple cider", "1 1/2 cups/225 grams raisins", "4 tablespoons/57 grams butter, melted", "1/2 cup/100 grams dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon/8 grams cinnamon", "Cinnamon sugar, for dusting (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a large electric mixer bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm milk.
