{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggplant Focaccia With Ricotta and Olives", "description": "A generous amount of olive oil in the dough gives this flatbread its especially crisp edges, and a soft, bready crumb. The topping, a mix of thinly sliced eggplant slathered with garlic-imbued olive oil and minced olives, is silky, rich and very flavorful \u2014 even without the optional (but excellent) anchovies. Just as good devoured warm from the oven and as it is at room temperature, this makes perfect picnic fare. Or serve it with a leafy salad for a light but satisfying dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/07apperex/merlin_175265544_dfb31786-5a65-4b09-bbaa-20fe1b513f87-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "breads, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "eggplant, olives, ricotta, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 694}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/80 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the bowl", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters lukewarm water (105 to 115 degrees)", "1 1/2 teaspoon/5 grams active dry or instant yeast", "1 teaspoon/5 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoon/10 grams kosher salt", "2 1/4 cups/305 grams bread flour, plus more as needed", "3/4 pound eggplant, thinly sliced", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup pitted olives", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 fat garlic clove, minced or finely grated", "5 anchovy fillets, finely chopped (optional)", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme or oregano leaves, or 1 teaspoon dried", "2/3 cup cherry tomatoes, halved", "1/3 cup fresh ricotta, plus more to taste", "Freshly ground black pepper, for garnish", "Torn fresh basil leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Oil a large bowl and set aside.
