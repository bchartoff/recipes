{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkish-Style Braised Green Beans", "description": "In this Turkish method, vegetables (and sometimes beans) are cooked in plenty of olive oil \u2014 usually with tomatoes, onions and one or two other ingredients \u2014 until they have almost lost their shape. Then they are cooled and served at room temperature, when their flavors are at their fullest. Very often an herb or citrus juice is added just before serving for a little spark; thick yogurt and lemon wedges are standard accompaniments.\n\nIt\u2019s probably obvious that these dishes are pretty much ideal for warm-weather meals. They not only can be made in advance, but also must be, so they can cool down. Even a day or two ahead is fine; just take them out of the refrigerator about 45 minutes before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/03/dining/03TURKISH_SPAN/03TURKISH_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 side-dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "green beans, mint, onion, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 160}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 266, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "596 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 medium onions, chopped", "2 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 pound green beans, trimmed and cut in half widthwise", "2 medium tomatoes, peeled, cored and chopped", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 teaspoon salt", "Black pepper", "1/4 cup roughly chopped mint", "Thick yogurt, for serving", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saut\u00e9 pan or heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking.
