{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Overnight French Toast", "description": "If you have a crowd for breakfast, overnight French toast is a winning idea. Instead of standing over the stove, cooking slice after slice, it bakes in the oven and emerges puffed and golden and ready for a big glug of maple syrup. Try making it with a stale loaf that you forgot to eat amid all the other holiday goodies. A fat brioche, fruit-filled panettone or a braided challah all work well. Stay away from croissants, though: Their chewy interiors are best enjoyed fresh.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/22/dining/22COOKING-OVERNIGHT-FRENCHTOAST2/22COOKING-OVERNIGHT-FRENCHTOAST2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8\u00a0servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, breads, custards and puddings", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1077}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 364, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "368 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus more for baking dish", "1 pound enriched bread, such as brioche, challah or panettone sliced 3/4-inch thick", "1/4 cup golden raisins (optional)", "6 large eggs", "2 1/2 cups whole milk", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1/3 cup light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Pinch of freshly ground nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/3 cup pecans, chopped (optional)", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar for dusting (optional)", "Maple syrup, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butter a 2-quart baking dish.
