{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach Cobbler", "description": "Some cobblers can be dry, but not this one. It puts a twist on an old-fashioned recipe, taking parts of the traditional, which uses a biscuit topping, and adding elements of a crisp, like oatmeal, for crunch. Maple syrup replaces the brown sugar usually found in peach cobbler recipes, which brings a lightly woody sweetness; nutmeg and cinnamon add that nostalgic warmth. You can use fresh or frozen peaches here \u2014 because you can and should have peach cobbler year-round \u2014 and you can even throw in a handful of blueberries, if you have them. But don\u2019t skip the vanilla ice cream: There\u2019s no substitute for that combination of hot and cold.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/14/dining/mp-peach-cobbler/mp-peach-cobbler-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "buttermilk, cobbler, crumble, and crisp, maple syrup, peach, rolled oat", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 265}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter, at room temperature, for greasing the pan", "5 ripe but firm peaches, peeled, halved, cored and sliced, or 2 pounds frozen peaches, thawed and drained (about 4 cups)", "1/2 cup/101 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons maple syrup", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/44 grams old-fashioned oats", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, frozen", "3/4 to 1 cup buttermilk", "2 tablespoons turbinado sugar", "Vanilla ice cream, for serving", "Mint leaves, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
