{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian Shepherd\u2019s Pie", "description": "French green lentils (Puy lentils) make a hearty base for this vegetarian shepherd\u2019s pie. They may be slighter harder to find than other lentils, but they\u2019re worth the extra effort. Unlike brown or red lentils, green lentils retain their shape and texture after cooking, which means they stand up well to a long simmer and this rich potato topping. Store-bought vegetable stock can vary greatly so be sure to buy one with a pleasant flavor that isn\u2019t too sweet. (Note: Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese contains rennet, so it is not vegetarian. Use a vegetarian Parmesan or leave it out. If you leave it out, be sure to season the potatoes well with salt and pepper.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/08/dining/08COOKING-VEG-SHEPHERDPIE1/08COOKING-VEG-SHEPHERDPIE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "leek, lentils, mushroom, peas, potato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1161}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 490, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1149 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and quartered (about 3 large)", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup whole milk", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1/2 cup packed grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or vegetarian Parmesan (optional)", "Freshly ground black pepper", "3/4 cup French lentils", "4 sprigs thyme", "3 1/2 cups vegetable broth", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "4 tablespoons butter", "8 ounces sliced mixed mushrooms, such as button, cremini, and shitaake", "1 large leek, white part only, thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "2 medium carrots, peeled and diced (about 1 cup)", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 tablespoons flour", "1 cup frozen peas, thawed", "1 to 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil over high heat.
