They are a nice change from mashed potatoes at Thanksgiving or Christmas (or any) dinner, make ideal carriers for fried or poached eggs at brunch, and can even double as latkes for Hanukkah. The power of the garlic is tamed in one easy step \u2014 by boiling it in the same water as the potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/26/dining/26COOKING_MASHEDPOTCAKES/26COOKING_MASHEDPOTCAKES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings (can be doubled)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "potato, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 144}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 198, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "433 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 to 3 pounds medium-starch potatoes, such as Yukon Gold, peeled and quartered", "12 whole garlic cloves, peeled", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup fine yellow cornmeal", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley", "1 large egg", "1 large egg yolk", "2 tablespoons whole milk", "1 tablespoon olive oil, more for frying", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place potatoes, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt in a pot and add water to cover by 1 inch.
