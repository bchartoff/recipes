{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Sherry Cobbler", "description": "This cocktail\u2019s combination of sherry, sugar and citrus is infinitely adaptable. Swap in a different sweetener. Use lemons or clementines or blood oranges instead of traditional orange slices. Add in seasonal fruit, say berries in summer, plums in autumn or jam any time of the year. Use different varieties of mint or another herb to garnish. Nuttier than fino or manzanilla, lighter and spicier than oloroso, amontillado sherry strikes the ideal middle ground in this drink. But you could also combine amontillado with another sherry \u2014 or tap in another variety altogether.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/09/dining/03cobblersrex-classic/merlin_215042802_591d39ac-d721-4bde-a92c-da2427a7ba0d-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "orange, sherry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 37}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 orange wheels, halved", "1/2 ounce <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014441-simple-syrup\">simple syrup</a>", "3 ounces dry amontillado sherry", "Ice cubes", "Mint sprigs, for garnish", "Crushed ice, for serving (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a cocktail shaker, muddle the 3 half-wheels of orange (reserve the remaining half-wheel for garnish) and the simple syrup.
