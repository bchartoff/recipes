It is a version of the famous 19th-century lobster recipe popularized at Delmonico\u2019s in New York.\n\nMaking it is an easy business, as much an assemblage as a recipe. You heat crabmeat in an enormous amount of butter, thicken it slightly with flour, thicken it a great deal with cream and eggs and cut the fat (slightly) with spices and booze. The resulting pinkish stew ought to be served with toast points or in a puff-pastry shell, perhaps with rice and absolutely with a green salad with a tart, lemony vinaigrette. Rawlings admits that you might use less cream, or less butter or fewer eggs. \u201cThe brandy may be omitted,\u201d she cautions, \u201cbut never the sherry.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll want to set everything up well before dinner so that you can work quickly and serve the dish directly from the pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/14/magazine/14eat2/14eat2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, brandy, crab meat, heavy cream, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 103}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 647, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "54 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "sodiumContent": "723 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 pound crabmeat, approximately 2 cups", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour or instant flour", "1 1/2 cups heavy cream", "2 tablespoons lemon juice (or juice of 1 lemon)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "Pinch of ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika, or to taste", "Pinch of cayenne pepper, or to taste", "1/2 cup dry sherry", "3 eggs", "1 tablespoon brandy", "1 tablespoon parsley, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, heavy skillet set over medium heat, melt the butter but do not allow it to brown.
