This method, which Mark Bittman learned from James Beard, is very low and very slow: you place the eggs over very low heat, stirring frequently, breaking up the curds as they form. The results are without compare. Make them for breakfast on the weekend, while the coffee brews and the bacon fries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/04/dining/04COOKING-SCRAMBLEDEGGS/04COOKING-SCRAMBLEDEGGS-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, editors' pick", "keywords": "eggs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1360}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 310, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "292 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 or 5 eggs", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons cream", "2 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them, just until  the yolks and whites are combined.
