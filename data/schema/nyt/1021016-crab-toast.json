{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crab Toast", "description": "Like the very best crab cakes on earth, which have as little dulling, distracting or deadening filler as possible, these crab toasts take that ethos to the extreme. There is no call for bell pepper or bread crumbs or diced celery; just the best fresh, sweet, saline crab meat you can buy, gently seasoned with a little lemon juice, bound with a tiny amount of tangy cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, then piled onto a slab of good toast, still warm. The toast is made ever so luxurious with a slathering of nutty brown butter mayonnaise. These two simple components \u2014 crab and brown butter toast \u2014 act in concert, and a glass of cold ros\u00e9 to wash them down makes for the most exhilarating, satisfying spring supper imaginable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/26/magazine/26mag-eat/26mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, finger foods, sandwiches, seafood, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "brown butter, chives, crab meat, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, egg, lemon, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 707}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick)", "1 whole egg plus 1 egg yolk", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup grapeseed oil", "12 ounces crab meat", "4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons finely minced chives", "1 teaspoon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, sour cream, heavy cream or half-and-half", "4 to 6 slices pane Francese, black pumpernickel or other rustic bread, toasted on both sides"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small sauce pot, brown the butter over medium heat, swirling the pot, until the butter is caramel-colored and has a nutty fragrance, about 5 minutes.
