{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Summer Vegetable Galette", "description": "A savory galette is the easier and more streamlined cousin of a classic quiche. It has a buttery pastry filled with any combination of vegetables, cheeses and meats, but without the need to make a custard to anchor it all. In this galette recipe, roasted summer vegetables (eggplant, zucchini, and tomatoes) are combined with goat cheese and fresh red chiles for a ratatouille-like mix with a bite, all nestled into a hearty whole-grain crust. Feel free to use any combination of cooked vegetables instead, even leftovers from the fridge. You\u2019ll need three cups total. Serve it as you would quiche, with a salad for lunch or a light dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/27/dining/27JPAPPE1/27JPAPPE1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, pies and tarts", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, eggplant, lemon juice, vegetables, zucchini, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 248}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 302, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "552 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup/80 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/90 grams rye flour or whole-wheat flour", "1 teaspoon/5 grams sugar", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams fine sea salt", "1 large egg", "Heavy cream, as needed", "1 stick/113 grams unsalted butter, cut into big pieces", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon/4 grams grated lemon zest (optional)", "2 medium eggplant (about 1 pound), trimmed and thinly sliced", "2 medium zucchini (about 3/4 pound), trimmed and thinly sliced", "1 pound plum tomatoes, cored and thinly sliced", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed", "Kosher salt, as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "2 hot chile peppers, such as cherry peppers, seeded and minced", "3 ounces goat cheese, softened", "1 small garlic clove, grated or pressed", "1 teaspoon thyme leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, or in a large bowl, pulse or mix together the flours, sugar, and salt.
