{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oven-Roasted Weekend Beef", "description": "The recipe for the beef is based on a simple and not terribly expensive roast of beef, crusted in a sort of dry rub that is rather more tropical than what you find in most parts of New England, save those inhabited by the great John (Doc) Willoughby, who was the executive editor of Gourmet until that magazine\u2019s demise. Willoughby has championed the intersection of American winter and Caribbean spices for years. This Willoughby-ish mixture \u2014 salt and pepper, coriander and cumin, brown sugar and paprika \u2014 is wonderful on fire-cooked beef, of course, but it\u2019s still excellent when used in an oven until it goes tight and deepest brown over the meat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/Oven-Roasted-Weekend-Beef/Oven-Roasted-Weekend-Beef-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "fall, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 249}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 tablespoon sweet Spanish paprika", "1 tablespoon brown sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander", "Red pepper flakes to taste", "1 sirloin tip roast, approximately 3 pounds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (or light a charcoal fire on one side of a large kettle grill, using a small pillow\u2019s worth of briquettes).
