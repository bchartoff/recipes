{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Updated Harlem Cocktail", "description": "Traditionally, the Harlem cocktail does not include lemon juice. I\u2019ve added it to this updated version because the additional acidity mellows the sweetness imparted by the drink\u2019s other components. If you\u2019ve got an extraction juicer, fresh pineapple juice makes this drink especially bright and lively \u2014 but canned juice will work fine. I like to finish the drink with a couple dashes of Angostura bitters, but consider them optional \u2014 to your taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/31/magazine/31drink-harlem/31drink-harlem-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 oz. gin (I like Plymouth for this)", "1/4 oz. maraschino liqueur", "3/4 oz. pineapple juice", "1 tsp. fresh lemon juice", "Angostura bitters", "Wedge of pineapple", "Brandied cherry"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chill a cocktail glass.
