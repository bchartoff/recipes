{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Lettuce With Crispy Garlic and Fried Eggs", "description": "In Chinese culture, cooked lettuce is a symbol of good luck and is often eaten during <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/864096-lunar-and-chinese-new-year\">Lunar New Year</a> feasts. In Cantonese, the word for lettuce is sang choy, and in Mandarin, it\u2019s sheng cai, which sounds like the words for \u201cgrowing wealth\u201d in each language. Stir-fried lettuce is commonly served as a bed for braised mushrooms or simply as a green side dish. Here, stir-fried lettuce, fried eggs and crispy garlic chips perch on a bed of rice, a simple meal with comforting flavors and textures. The joy of this preparation is that the lettuce retains a fresh crunch even after cooking; iceberg is preferred, but romaine will give you similar results. Vegetarian stir-fry sauce is a product sold in Asian grocery stores, but you can also use oyster sauce. For a shortcut, skip the fried garlic and top with store-bought crispy fried onions or shallots.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/22/dining/hm-stir-fried-lettuce/hm-stir-fried-lettuce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "egg, garlic, iceberg lettuce, lunar new year, soy sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 381}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head of iceberg lettuce (about 1\u00bd pounds)", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "2 teaspoons vegetarian stir-fry sauce, or oyster sauce", "1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "Black or white pepper", "2 tablespoons plus \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 (1-inch) piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "4 eggs", "Steamed rice, for serving", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds", "2 scallions, green and white parts, finely sliced", "Maggi seasoning sauce, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a sharp paring knife, run it around the core of the lettuce, then gently pull it out.
