{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lumpia Shanghai", "description": "Lumpia are cousins to spring rolls, a tradition that most likely goes back to the Chinese traders who first visited the Philippines in the ninth century. As kids, we\u2019d crowd around the kitchen counter to make them, spooning out the filling and rolling up the skins before sliding them into hot oil. They come in different incarnations and may be served unfried and even unwrapped, but the classic is lumpia Shanghai, skinny cigarillos with supercrunchy skins, packed with meat, juices seething. I like dipping them in banana ketchup, which you can buy or improvise by cooking overripe bananas and tomato paste into a sweet-and-sour jam.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Angela Dimayuga"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/dining/08Filipinorex2-lumpia/merlin_160617828_f5306258-6fcd-49ae-be0e-c4352bfa328d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "20 lumpia", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, finger foods, meat, project", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, banana ketchup, fish sauce, ground beef, ground pork, spring roll wrappers, water chestnuts", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 65}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium carrot, peeled, then coarsely grated on box grater (about 1/2 packed cup)", "1/2 medium yellow onion, finely minced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1/2 (8-ounce) can water chestnuts, drained, then finely minced (about 1/2 cup)", "1 celery stalk, finely minced (about 1/2 cup)", "3 garlic cloves, finely minced", "2 eggs (1 egg white reserved to seal wrappers)", "1 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 pound ground pork", "1/2 pound ground beef", "3/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper", "20 (8-by-8-inch) lumpia or spring roll wrappers (from two 11-ounce packages), thawed if frozen, peeled to separate, then set under a moistened cloth", "Canola oil", "Banana ketchup, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the filling: In a large bowl, combine the carrot, onion, water chestnuts, celery, garlic, 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk, fish sauce and 1/2 teaspoon salt; mix until well blended.
