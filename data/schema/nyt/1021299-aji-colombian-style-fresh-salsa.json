Instead, a hot sauce called aj\u00ed \u2014 also the Colombian word for chiles \u2014 is served tableside. There are as many types of aj\u00ed as there are regions in Colombia, but this version, heavy on cilantro and onions, is a good all-purpose sauce that goes especially well with fried foods. Many aj\u00ed recipes include some white vinegar or lime juice. I prefer using plain water to dilute mine, and I serve lime wedges on the side for diners to add at their discretion.
