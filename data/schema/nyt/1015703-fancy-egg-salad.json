The writer, David Latt, cooks his eggs on a low, gentle boil for 30 minutes and finds they come out perfectly done, with the yolk flaky, but feel free to use whatever method you like, as long as the eggs are hard-boiled. (We give instructions for boiling and steaming in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/18-how-to-make-eggs\">our guide to cooking eggs</a>.) You can also add other spices: mustard, ground mustard seed, cumin or rosemary. The parsley can be replaced with cilantro, and the mayonnaise can be flavored.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Latt"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/28/dining/28COOKING-FANCY-EGGSALAD2/28COOKING-FANCY-EGGSALAD2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, quick, salads and dressings, sandwiches", "keywords": "egg, mayonnaise", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 229}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 108, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "150 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 eggs", "1 tablespoon Italian parsley, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon capers, dried, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon finely chopped shallots", "1 slice of bacon, crisp, finely chopped", "1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "Salt and pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the eggs into a gently boiling pot of water and cook for 30 minutes.
