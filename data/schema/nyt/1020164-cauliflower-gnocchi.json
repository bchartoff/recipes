Here, they\u2019re made with a combination of cauliflower and potato. The cauliflower is roasted alongside the potato, which helps intensify the vegetable\u2019s natural sweetness. If short on time, the gnocchi can be made in advance through Step 4 and frozen. (Arrange gnocchi in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until firm, then pack into resealable freezer bags.) When ready to use, saut\u00e9 the frozen gnocchi as in Step 5, increasing the cook time as needed, or heat gently in tomato sauce, or even just melted butter, until tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/09/dining/kc-cauliflower-gnocchi/merlin_153033762_d89f822d-79d0-4d73-b5ce-5220ea3ae491-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas, project", "keywords": "capers, cauliflower, chives, lemon juice, potato, radish, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 165}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 402, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "506 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 small head cauliflower (about 8 ounces)", "1 medium russet potato (about 8 ounces)", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour (about 4 ounces), plus more for dusting", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 large egg yolk", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for greasing", "1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick)", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup thinly sliced radishes (about 4 ounces)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "Chopped chives, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the gnocchi: Heat oven to 450 degrees.
