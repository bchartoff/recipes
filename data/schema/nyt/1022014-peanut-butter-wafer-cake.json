{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peanut-Butter Wafer Cake", "description": "This towering trifecta of flavor and texture \u2014 crisp wafer, creamy peanut butter and glossy dark chocolate \u2014 comes together quickly and easily. The hidden star here is Katherine Yang\u2019s utterly delicious peanut butter cream, which binds the layers. It\u2019s savory and nutty, silken and not too sweet. Wafer sheets come in standard 8 1/2-inch rounds, so tempering the chocolate in a 10-inch-wide, shallow pan is the simple trick to easy dipping. You can use an offset spatula to spread the filling, or for a more impressive presentation, use a star tip, and pipe swirls, rosettes or scallops. The cake should be eaten soon after assembly, as the filling will eventually start to soften the wafer\u2019s crispness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/21/magazine/21mag-eat/21mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, chocolate, egg, heavy cream, milk, peanut, peanut butter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 475}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream", "1 large egg plus 1 large yolk", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/133 grams smooth, commercial peanut butter (preferably Skippy)", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "8 ounces/225 grams high-quality bittersweet chocolate shards/chips (1 1/3 cups)", "1 tablespoon shortening", "Heaping 1/3 cup/60 grams dry-roasted salted peanuts", "1 teaspoon confectioners\u2019 sugar", "4 (8 1/2-inch-round) plain or cocoa wafer sheets"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring milk and cream to simmer in a heavy 1-quart saucepan over medium heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk egg and yolk in a medium bowl.
