I noticed recently that shredded broccoli stems were a main ingredient in a packaged coleslaw at my local supermarket \u2013 a great idea for using up the stems cut away from broccoli sold by the crown or floret. It\u2019s much more economical to buy broccoli on the stem, which gives you the fixings for this salad. It takes minutes to peel and then shred them in a food processor. Don\u2019t use the food processor for shredding cabbage, though \u2014 that\u2019s better done by hand if you don\u2019t want mush.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/24/science/26recipehealth/26recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 generous servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "broccoli, cabbage, quinoa, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 31}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 247, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1055 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 cups mixed shredded broccoli stems, green cabbage and kohlrabi  (peel broccoli stems and kohlrabi before shredding) (about 3/4 pound)", "Salt to taste", "1/2 cup cooked quinoa", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill", "1/2 teaspoons nigella seeds (optional)", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "1/4 cup plain low-fat yogurt", "Freshly ground pepper", "1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss the shredded vegetables with salt to taste and place in a strainer set over a bowl.
