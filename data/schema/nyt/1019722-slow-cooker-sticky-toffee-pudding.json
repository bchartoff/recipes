{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Sticky Toffee Pudding", "description": "Sticky toffee pudding isn't so much a pudding in the American sense, but an extremely moist baked or steamed British date cake topped with a glossy sauce of brown sugar and cream. Steamed cakes \u2014 a genre unto themselves in Britain \u2014 are easily made in the slow cooker. This adaptation uses espresso powder in the cake and sauce to balance the honeyed taste of the dates and brown sugar: Nevertheless, it is still quite sweet, as it should be. This recipe can also be made more quickly in the oven, and the resulting cake\u2019s texture will be different than the steamed version \u2014 sliceable, like a moist quick bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/dining/sg-sticky-toffee/sg-sticky-toffee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "australian, british", "recipeCategory": "cakes, custards and puddings", "keywords": "dates, pecan, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 92}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 687, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "108 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "471 milligrams", "sugarContent": "82 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons instant espresso powder", "8 ounces/230 grams pitted Medjool dates, finely chopped (about 15 large dates)", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters maple syrup", "1/3 cup/75 grams packed light brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 cup/220 grams packed light brown sugar", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 tablespoon instant espresso powder", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup/50 grams toasted pecans, coarsely chopped", "Unsweetened whipped cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Slow Cooker Method", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pudding: Generously butter a 2-quart souffl\u00e9 dish, or another 2-quart oven-safe baking dish that fits into your slow cooker.\u00a0In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup,\u00a0mix 1/2 cup water with 2 tablespoons espresso powder, and stir to dissolve.
