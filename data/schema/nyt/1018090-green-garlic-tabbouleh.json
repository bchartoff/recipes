{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Garlic Tabbouleh", "description": "This heady version of classic tabbouleh salad is for\u00a0garlic lovers only.\u00a0Instead of the salad relying solely on parsley, the green garlic stems add intensity and pungency to the mix, while a touch of mint adds freshness. You can tone down the garlic flavor by increasing the parsley-to-green-garlic ratio if you like, or vice versa. And if you can\u2019t get young green garlic with floppy, soft green stems, use scallions or ramp greens instead. Garlic chives will also work. This is best made in late spring when green garlic is just coming into season; it will be at its most tender and mildest then.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/04/dining/04APPE/04APPE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "quick, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "bulgur, cucumber, green garlic, mint, parsley, scallion, tomato, side dish, spring, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 117}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 230, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "273 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, more for the bulgur cooking water", "1 cup medium bulgur", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "Pinch allspice", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more for serving", "2 1/2 cups coarsely chopped Italian parsley leaves", "1 1/4 cups finely chopped green garlic, tender stems and tops only (save the bulbs for another use)", "1/2 cup chopped fresh mint", "1 cup diced tomato", "1 cup diced cucumber", "1 bunch thinly sliced scallions (1/2 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, bring 2 cups well-salted water to a boil.
