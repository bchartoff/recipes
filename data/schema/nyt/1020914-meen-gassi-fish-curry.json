In India, a cook might reach for Byadagi chiles from Karnataka to stain the sauce a bright red color. In the United States, chiles de \u00e1rbol are easier to find. A stone mortar and pestle is the best tool for grinding the curry paste; the finer you can get the coconut and chile, the smoother and richer the texture of the final sauce. From there, the recipe is very adaptable \u2014 replace the fillets with any fish you like, including nice oily ones like mackerel or sardines.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/tr-meen-gassi/merlin_169211904_179ec60d-5d01-4fde-afe0-4417616cf0f0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood", "keywords": "coconut, ginger, striped bass, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 52}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "4 skin-on fish fillets (about 1 1/2 pounds total), such as striped bass or snapper", "1 teaspoon plus 1 tablespoon ghee", "2 teaspoons whole coriander seeds", "6 dry red chiles, such as chile de \u00e1rbol", "1 cup fresh or frozen grated coconut", "1 tablespoon tamarind pulp", "1 small yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)", "1 green finger chile (or serrano chile), finely chopped", "2 tablespoons coconut oil", "Fresh cilantro sprigs, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix together the salt and turmeric, then rub the mixture all over the fish and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small skillet, heat 1 teaspoon ghee over medium.
