{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Citrus-Glazed Sweet Potatoes", "description": "These candied sweet potatoes work as a side dish for any dinner or holiday celebration by balancing citrusy sweet and savory flavors \u2014 and they also produce top-notch leftovers. Right out of the oven or the fridge, they are sure to add a pleasantly tart note to any meal. The braising liquid thickens as the tubers cook, resulting in a tangy glaze that coats every bite. Its acidity also helps the sweet potatoes stay intact with a slight bite even as they soften. The thinly sliced orange zest becomes tender and develops a marmalade-like taste. The shiny strips make for a beautiful garnish, along with the syrupy pan sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/10/dining/08sharerex1-sweetpots/merlin_197232333_08650eb2-d2ee-493d-96eb-3678ae81984a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 792}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 medium oranges", "1 lemon", "2 limes", "3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "3 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 9 small)", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees (see Tip).
