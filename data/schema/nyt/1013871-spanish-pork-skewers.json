One delicious hot tapas classic easily made at home is called pinchos Moru\u00f1os, or Moorish skewers,  essentially small kebabs of pork marinated in Arabic (Moorish) spices and grilled, usually on a hot steel plancha. Because most Muslim Arabs wouldn\u2019t eat pork, one presumes the original dish was lamb. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how it evolved into this ubiquitous tapa selection in Christian Spain. Nevertheless, now it means pork seasoned with garlic, cumin, coriander, piment\u00f3n and sometimes oregano. Once skewered, they need only about 5 minutes on a hot griddle.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/spanish-pork-skewers/spanish-pork-skewers-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "12 small skewers", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "appetizer, garlic, pork tenderloin, spices", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 121}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 92, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "142 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin, in half-inch slices", "Salt", "pepper", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "2 teaspoons coriander seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "1/2 teaspoon piment\u00f3n, sweet or hot", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "2 garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Thread the pork onto 12 bamboo skewers.
