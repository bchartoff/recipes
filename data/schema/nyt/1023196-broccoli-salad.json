{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broccoli Salad", "description": "It is easy to understand why broccoli salad is a mainstay of potluck dinners and community gatherings. Not only is it a crowd-pleaser, but also raw broccoli is a clever make-ahead ingredient because it maintains its hardy texture and crunch over time. (This Southern-inspired recipe can be made up to 24 hours ahead, then stored in the fridge.) While most traditional Southern broccoli salads feature a creamy mayonnaise dressing and are finished with bacon bits and grated cheese, this vegan riff offers a punchy vinegar mixture that serves as a quick pickling liquid for the onions and raisins before it\u2019s used as the final dressing. If you are making this salad in advance, leave the toasted almonds out until you are ready to eat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/25/dining/25MEMORIAL-DAYREX2-broccoli-salad/merlin_206068179_23a60df2-8c88-413a-bdc5-edf47c608126-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weeknight, side dish", "keywords": "apple cider vinegar, broccoli, raisin, fourth of july, memorial day, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1227}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup golden or black raisins (or dried cranberries)", "1/2 red onion, finely sliced", "1/4 cup apple cider vinegar", "4 teaspoons granulated sugar", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 1/2 pounds broccoli (about 2 heads)", "1 apple (any variety), cored and cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "2 scallions, white and green parts, finely sliced", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1/2 cup toasted sliced almonds, pepitas or sunflower seeds (see Tip)", "1 cup red or green grapes (optional), halved crosswise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: Place raisins and red onion in a small bowl.
