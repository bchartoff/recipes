{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Instant Pot Pork Stew With Red Wine and Olives", "description": "Pork shoulder is one of the most glorious things to cook in an electric pressure cooker. The meat becomes velvety and suffused with rich, brawny juices. Here, red wine, tomatoes, rosemary and sage perfume the pork, while olives, stirred in at the end, give it brightness. This stew is even better cooked a day or two ahead, giving the flavors time to meld. Making it in advance also gives the fat a chance to solidify, so it\u2019s easy to remove before reheating. Then, if you like, you can reheat the stew in the electric pressure cooker using the saut\u00e9 setting. Serve this over polenta or rice, or with good bread, to soak up the meaty sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/27/dining/22Apperex1/merlin_196071996_11a8a10a-bafa-4018-8f8f-7d3ec95f3302-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, main course", "keywords": "instant pot, make-ahead, olives, pork shoulder, red wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1014}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds pork shoulder or pork stew meat, cut into 2-inch chunks", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more as needed", "3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed", "6 garlic cloves, grated, passed through a press or crushed into a paste", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage", "Large pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds", "Olive oil", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1 (15-ounce) can whole peeled plum tomatoes", "2 medium carrots, sliced 1/2-inch thick (about 1 cup)", "1/2 cup pitted and torn green olives, such as Castelvetrano", "Chopped parsley or basil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the pork all over with the salt and pepper.
