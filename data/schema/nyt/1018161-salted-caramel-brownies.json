Matt Lewis and Renato Poliafito of New York's Baked bakeries are not the first to note the affinity of caramel and chocolate, but by emphasizing the bitter, sweet and salty notes in both, they\u2019ve made that rare thing \u2014 a perfectly balanced bite. The bittersweetness of the caramel can be easily adjusted by cooking it less (for a milder, Kraft-like taste) or more (edgier, stronger).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/07/dining/salted-caramel-brownie-2/salted-caramel-brownie-2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen brownies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "cocoa powder, dark chocolate, heavy cream, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 581}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 311, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "175 milligrams", "sugarContent": "30 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters light corn syrup", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream", "3/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 cup/115 grams sour cream", "2 sticks/225 grams unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes, more for greasing pan", "1 1/4 cups/150 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder", "11 ounces/300 grams dark chocolate (60 to 72 percent cacao), coarsely chopped", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/105 grams firmly packed light brown sugar", "5 eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "Coarse sugar (such as raw or turbinado) and flaky salt, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the caramel: In a medium saucepan, combine sugar and corn syrup with 1/4 cup water.
