{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Flank Steak With Worcestershire Butter", "description": "Grilled steak covered in melting herb butter is a cornerstone of summer cooking. Here, both the steak and the compound butter are spiked with Worcestershire sauce, fresh thyme and garlic for an intensely brawny flavor. Then, the steak is garnished with a mix of charred tomatoes, scallions and basil, which gives everything a juicy sweetness brightened with lemon. You can use any cut of beef here; the flank steak has a deeply mineral taste and chewy texture that\u2019s at its best sliced thin. But rib-eye, skirt steak and sirloin also work; just be sure to adjust the cooking time for thinner or thicker pieces.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/21apperex/21apperex-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat", "keywords": "flank steak, tomatoes, worcestershire sauce, low-carb, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 586}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds flank steak", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "6 thyme sprigs", "3 garlic cloves, finely grated or mashed to a paste", "1 jalape\u00f1o, minced", "2 tablespoons minced chives, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 tablespoon coconut palm sugar or dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed", "3 ripe plum tomatoes", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "3 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced", "Handful of torn fresh basil, plus more for serving", "1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), softened", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme", "1 tablespoon minced chives", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 garlic clove, grated or mashed to a paste", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season steak all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
