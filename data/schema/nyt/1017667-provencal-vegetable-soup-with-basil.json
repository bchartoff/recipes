{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Proven\u00e7al Vegetable Soup With Basil", "description": "This is my version of soupe au pistou, beloved in the South of France in both homes and restaurants. It is quite similar to neighboring Italy\u2019s minestrone al pesto. Made with flavorful ripe summer vegetables, it does not need a meat-based broth. To keep the soup green and fresh looking, some of the vegetables are cooked separately and added to the pot just before serving. A generous spoonful of garlicky basil pistou in each soup bowl gives the soup its bright sunny character.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/02/dining/02KITCHEN3/02KITCHEN3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, beans, potato, romano beans, shell beans, zucchini, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 70}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "489 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups fresh shelling beans, such as cranberry or cannellini, from about 1 pound in the pod", "1 small onion, peeled and stuck with clove", "1 thyme sprig", "1 bay leaf", "1 large garlic clove, halved", "1 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, diced, about 1 cup", "Salt and pepper", "1/2 pound yellow-fleshed potato, peeled and diced, or use baby potatoes, skin on, halved or quartered", "1/4 pound romano beans, in 1-inch pieces", "1/4 pound yellow wax beans", "1/2 pound zucchini or summer squash, chopped, about 2 cups", "2 cups basil leaves", "4 small garlic cloves", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 ounces grated Parmigiano, plus extra for serving", "Salt and pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the beans: Put the beans and 5 cups water in a saucepan over high heat.
