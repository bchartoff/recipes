{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cottage Cheese Pasta With Tomatoes, Scallions and Currants", "description": "Satisfying the same creamy urge as mac and cheese, noodles with cottage cheese is a comforting Eastern European\u00a0staple that\u2019s sometimes topped with golden fried onions and a dusting of black pepper and cinnamon. This version trades caramelized onions for slivers of sharp raw scallion to contrast with the richness of the cottage cheese, which melts into a sauce upon contact with the hot pasta. The currants lean into the cinnamon's sweetness, while halved cherry tomatoes and mint make the dish juicy and fresh. It\u2019s an unusual take on the original dish that\u2019s easy to riff on \u2014 feel free to add or leave out ingredients to make it your own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/02/dining/28Apperex-pasta/merlin_188345814_86fa048e-e1de-4819-be68-69de2eb333a5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "cottage cheese, currants, pasta, scallions, tomato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 832}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup dried currants (or chopped raisins)", "1/4 teaspoon salt, plus more for boiling the pasta", "1 pound short pasta, such as farfalle, cavatelli or fusilli", "4 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced", "1 cup halved cherry tomatoes", "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 cup whole milk cottage cheese (or ricotta)", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for serving", "1/2 cup torn mint leaves, plus more for serving", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped parsley, plus more for serving", "Ground cinnamon, for serving (optional)", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
