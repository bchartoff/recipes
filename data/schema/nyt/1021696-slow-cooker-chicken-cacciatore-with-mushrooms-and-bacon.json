{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Chicken Cacciatore With Mushrooms and Bacon", "description": "Cacciatore means \u201chunter style\u201d in Italian, and this is a slow cooker riff on that classic Italian braise, which usually features chicken or rabbit with lots of peppers, tomatoes and wine. In this recipe, the mushrooms, bacon and wine give the finished dish a deep and delicious savoriness. The bacon does triple duty: It provides most of the fat in the recipe, it suffuses the dish with smoky flavor, and its little crispy bits hold up nicely over the long simmer. As the dish cooks, the vegetables release their juices, which don\u2019t evaporate in the slow cooker, so this may be a more stew-like cacciatore. This makes it delicious served over pasta or polenta or in a bowl served with a hunk of crusty bread to sop up the juices. To serve it as a hoagie or submarine sandwich, use a slotted spoon to scoop the chicken and sauce onto the rolls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/10/dining/adg-slow-cooker-chicken-cacciatore/merlin_180213663_0cbe7772-1528-4406-8152-20a1fce81f84-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "bacon, chicken, mushroom, red wine, slow cooker, dairy-free, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2002}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound bacon, preferably thick-cut, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 pound cremini mushrooms, sliced", "8 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1/4 cup dry red wine", "1/2 large red onion, thinly sliced", "1 red, yellow or orange bell pepper, thinly sliced", "8 ounces jarred roasted red peppers, drained (about 1 heaping cup)", "3/4 cup crushed or diced canned tomatoes (about half a 14-ounce can)", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "2 to 2 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/3 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley", "Cooked polenta, pasta or hoagie rolls, for serving  (optional)", "Torn fresh basil leaves, for topping", "Grated Parmesan, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fry the bacon in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat until crisp and the fat is rendered, about 8 minutes.
