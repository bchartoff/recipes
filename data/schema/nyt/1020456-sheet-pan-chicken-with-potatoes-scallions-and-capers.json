{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Potatoes, Scallions and Capers", "description": "This one-pan chicken dinner requires only five ingredients, making it perfect for busy weeknights. Meaty chicken thighs roast on top of scallions and potatoes until the chicken is golden and juicy and the scallions are tender and sweet. Despite the short ingredient list, this dish delivers deep flavor and varying textures: The potatoes on the bottom soak up the tasty pan juices while the ones on top turn crispy. Any extra pan drippings get mixed with capers and lemon juice for a quick, tangy sauce. You could also use some of the sauce to dress a simple side salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/dining/kc-chicken-and-scallions/merlin_160015689_3648dffa-719e-4670-861e-de98e7c64ff5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, poultry, roasts, vegetables", "keywords": "capers, chicken, lemon, potato, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1384}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 scallions, trimmed (about 1 pound)", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound Yukon gold potatoes (about 3 large), sliced 1/8-inch-thick (about 4 cups)", "8 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus 4 lemon wedges for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
