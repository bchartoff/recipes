{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Small-Batch Blueberry Muffins", "description": "Michelle Lopez, the author of \u201cWeeknight Baking: Recipes to Fit Your Schedule\u201d (Simon & Schuster, 2019), was inspired by the oversize muffins at Levain Bakery when she developed this recipe. The keys to the loftiest muffins? Plenty of batter and a high oven temperature, which ensures that they rise quickly and bake with a beautiful top and a tender interior. For the best results, rest your batter before baking. One very important tip: Spray the muffin pan and its edges generously with nonstick cooking spray. When the muffins come out of the oven, immediately use a small offset spatula to gently release their edges from the pan, then let them cool completely before removing them. You can use frozen blueberries instead of fresh, but be sure to thaw and drain them, then let them come to room temperature before adding them to the batter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/10/dining/10SmallBatch-blueberry-muffins/merlin_183223992_ce1e2a41-06af-4731-af1c-ae8094820c2a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, breads, pastries, dessert, main course, side dish", "keywords": "blueberries, butter, mother\u2019s day, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 897}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cup/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), at room temperature", "1/2 cup/100 grams plus 4 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whole milk, at room temperature", "1 1/4 cup/180 grams fresh blueberries, at room temperature", "Nonstick cooking spray"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1/2 cup sugar on medium-high until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.
