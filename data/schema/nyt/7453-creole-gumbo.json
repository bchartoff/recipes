It was about her gumbo, which is brackish and silky and delicious, and for which she offered a recipe. Ms. Chase told them about giving a dinner in 1942 for a group of Tuskegee Airmen who refused to eat the gumbo she and a friend had prepared for them because they thought the file powder she put in the pot was a voodoo potion intended to ensnare the men. \u201cOne of the men was telling the others, 'Don't eat the gumbo! If you eat that gumbo, you'll never leave New Orleans.' '' Perhaps!
