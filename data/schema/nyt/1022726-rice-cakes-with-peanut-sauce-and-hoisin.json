{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Cakes With Peanut Sauce and Hoisin", "description": "This vegan dish is reminiscent of the classic Cantonese dim sum of fried cheung fun, or steamed rice noodle rolls, which is served with two contrasting sauces: a caramelly hoisin sauce and a nutty sesame sauce. In this recipe, tenaciously chewy rice cakes are stir-fried until crispy, then smothered in a sweet and earthy peanut sauce and finished with syrupy hoisin. Rice cakes deserve to be a pantry staple for many reasons: They can be used as a filling substitute for short pasta, added to stews or quickly pan-fried with your favorite sauce. Sold in Chinese or Korean markets, they come in tubes (like those used in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022114-gungjung-tteokbokki-korean-royal-court-rice-cakes\">tteokbokki</a>) or sliced disks, and are packaged in vacuum-sealed packs or frozen, so they keep for ages. If you\u2019re looking for a suitable substitute, you could use fresh rice noodle rolls, or even gnocchi.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/01/dining/hm-stir-fried-rice-cakes/merlin_196837527_5c8a9001-38ef-4280-8044-e4e84d34fc48-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "hoisin sauce, peanut butter, rice cakes, soy sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 513}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "2 pounds rice cake sticks or sliced rice cakes, fresh or frozen", "2 tablespoons neutral oil such as vegetable or grapeseed", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1/2 pound yu choy or other Asian greens, halved lengthwise", "2 tablespoons hoisin sauce, diluted with 1 teaspoon water", "2 scallions, finely sliced", "1 tablespoon toasted white sesame seeds", "1/3 cup smooth peanut butter (natural or emulsified)", "3 tablespoons hot water", "1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 garlic clove, grated", "1 teaspoon soy sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
