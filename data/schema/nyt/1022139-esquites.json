{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Esquites", "description": "Esquites are the salad form of elotes, charcoal-grilled Mexican corn on the cob that is slathered with a creamy sauce, seasoned with chile powder and lime juice and topped with Cotija, a crumbly, aged Mexican cheese. This version doesn\u2019t require a grill, and instead chars the corn kernels in a hot skillet until browned and caramelized. Cotija brings salty, milky accents to the salad. Ancho chile powder adds smoky notes, but you can use any type of chile powder you favor. Leftovers transform quickly into a great pasta salad the next day; simply toss with cooked pasta and olive oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/30/multimedia/30summer-rao-esquites/merlin_187538325_2aefef93-b266-48f6-88b6-04e5c9782ab1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "cast iron, chile powder, corn, cotija, lime juice, mayonnaise, salad, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1316}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "6 cups fresh corn kernels (from 6 to 7 ears fresh corn)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 tablespoons mayonnaise", "6 tablespoons Mexican crema or sour cream", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving", "4 ounces Cotija cheese (scant 1 cup)", "Ancho chile powder (or chipotle or cayenne), for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large cast iron or heavy skillet, heat oil over medium-high.
