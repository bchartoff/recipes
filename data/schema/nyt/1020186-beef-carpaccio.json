{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef Carpaccio", "description": "Beef tenderloin is called for here as it will unfailingly yield the tenderest carpaccio. It is a long, slender, tapered muscle that runs under the ribs and close to the back bone, and as such is, in a way, shielded from being worked very hard, unlike cuts lower on the animal. As for all of us, the closer to the ground the muscle lives, the tougher becomes the work. Some chefs have a real affinity for the harder-working muscles. Top round, for example, is also often called for in carpaccio recipes and is cut from a muscle that has to work harder, and therefore, is thought to have more character, and more flavor. I would gently warn that harder-working muscles come with a little more \u201cchew.\u201d Try it here, as written, with sure success, then explore other cuts if you're interested.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/28/magazine/28mag-eat-slideshow-slide-G373/28mag-eat-slideshow-slide-G373-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "appetizer, arugula, beef tenderloin, parmesan, truffle oil, high protein", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound beef tenderloin", "4 cups neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil", "1 large russet potato, peeled, cut into 2 1/2-inch-by-1/4-inch matchsticks and soaked in water", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Black- or white-truffle oil, for drizzling", "2 cups arugula (about 1 1/2 ounces), washed and trimmed", "1/2 lemon, juiced (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "2 ounces Parmesan, shaved into curls with a Y-peeler"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the beef tenderloin of all fat, sinew and silver skin.
