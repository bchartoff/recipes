{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Curry Chicken Skewers", "description": "These small brochettes, about 2 ounces each, are perfect party food. Ideally they are grilled outdoors over coals, but also work fine on a stovetop cast iron grill or under the broiler. Threading each piece of meat onto two skewers, rather than one, keeps the meat from twirling and makes it easier to grill. (If using bamboo skewers, soak them in warm water for 15 minutes, so they won\u2019t catch fire.) The spicy curry sauce is used both as a marinade and a dipping sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/19/dining/chickenskewers/chickenskewers-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 skewers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, skewers and kebabs", "keywords": "chicken, coconut, curry, garam masala, ginger, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 141}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 220, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "326 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds skinless boneless chicken breasts or thighs", "Kosher salt", "1 teaspoon turmeric, more for seasoning meat", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne, more for seasoning meat", "2 teaspoons garam masala", "Zest and juice of 1 small lime", "1 1/2 cups thick coconut milk", "2 tablespoons grated ginger", "3 tablespoons grated unsweetened coconut, fresh or frozen", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1/2 teaspoon yellow or black mustard seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut chicken into flat 2-x-2-inch pieces.
