This quick casserole for a crowd is exactly that, made elegant and easy so you can have a perfectly cooked\u00a0portion\u00a0for each person with very little work.\u00a0Layer your polenta with anything you desire, whether salami or ham \u2014 or keep it vegetable-centric with spinach or oven-roasted tomatoes.
