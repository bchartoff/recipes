For those burgers, Mr. All\u00e9no's butcher, Yves-Marie Le Bourdonnec delivered a mix of chuck and beef rib. But the butcher thought the American T-bone steak to be the ideal. The T-bone does not exist in France, but to make his point, Mr. Le Bourdonnec made his own. He combined a piece of filet, which is tender but less flavorful, with a piece of contrefilet, which is marbled and tasty, but slightly less tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jane Sigal"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/07/16/dining/burger-t-bone/burger-t-bone-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, burgers", "keywords": "main course, t-bone steak", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1064, "unsaturatedFatContent": "39 grams", "carbohydrateContent": null, "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "75 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "91 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "sodiumContent": "1063 milligrams", "sugarContent": null, "transFatContent": "4 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds T-bone steaks", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Fleur de sel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut meat off bones; discard bones.
