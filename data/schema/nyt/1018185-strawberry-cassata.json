{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Cassata", "description": "The classic Sicilian cassata is a spongecake layered with creamy sweetened ricotta, a heavenly combination. Though usually topped with colorful candied fruits, this summery version is covered with ripe red berries. Ideally, the spongecake should be made a day ahead and the cassata assembled at least several hours in advance. Look for the freshest, tastiest ricotta; most good cheese stores can supply it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/30/dining/cassata/cassata-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cake flour, fresh ricotta, grappa, strawberries, vodka, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 633}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 345, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "115 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter, for preparing pan", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, for preparing pan", "6 large eggs, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/150 grams sugar", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "Pinch of salt", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "1 1/3 cups/140 grams sifted cake flour", "1/2 cup sugar", "Zest of 1 lemon, removed in large strips", "2 tablespoons grappa or vodka", "2 cups/500 grams fresh ricotta", "1/4 cup/55 grams sugar, or more to taste", "1/2 pound/223 grams ripe strawberries, hulled and halved", "1 tablespoon sugar", "2 tablespoons lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
