{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butternut Squash Congee With Chile Oil", "description": "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018321-chicken-congee\">Congee</a> comes in many textures and flavors, under a number of different names, and is eaten widely across East, South East and South Asia. This particular version of congee is not traditional to any region or cuisine, but is a seasonal interpretation, incorporating butternut squash for a warming, naturally sweet, earthy glow. The chile oil delivers a lively counter to the mellow nature of this congee, delivering both heat and savoriness. Using leftover rice gives you a hearty congee in just about 30 minutes, but make sure you give it a good stir at the end to further break up the rice and create a creamy finish. Butternut can be an unwieldy vegetable and many find it hard to handle, so try cutting it into smaller pieces before slicing the skin off with a sharp knife or peeler. Quicker still, opt for pre-cut cubes of butternut which can often be found at the supermarket.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/09/dining/hm-butternut-squash-jook/merlin_216140910_a674b145-b47a-45ef-9fad-95aa0f1215e7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "butternut squash, porridge, rice, fall, winter, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 799}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tightly packed cups leftover medium- or long-grain rice (preferably refrigerated)", "1 tablespoon neutral oil (such as canola)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such Diamond Crystal)", "6 cups vegetable stock", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed", "1 pound (about 1/2 small) butternut squash, peeled, seeded and diced in 1-inch pieces", "1 small piece kombu (optional)", "2 scallions, finely sliced", "Chile oil or chile crisp, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the rice, oil and salt in a large pot and stir to combine, breaking up any clumps of rice.
