{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whatever You\u2019ve Got Fried Rice", "description": "<em>This is a no-recipe recipe, a recipe without an ingredients list or steps. It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</em>\nStart with some cooked rice, white or brown, a cup or so per person, made fresh or pulled from the freezer where you keep some in a plastic bag against the promise of just such an exercise. (The chill helps separate the grains.) Also helpful, also in the freezer: bags of diced organic vegetables you can get at the market (the mixed corn, carrots and peas number, for instance). For the rest: meat if you eat meat, a couple eggs, lots of chopped garlic and ginger, some scallions. You can make a sauce from soy sauce and sesame oil (about a 3:1 ratio) and fire it up with a teaspoon or two of gochujang. You\u2019ll need a little less than a quarter cup of sauce to feed four.\nTo the wok! Crank the heat, add a little neutral oil, then toss in your meat. I like chopped brisket from the barbecue joint, or pastrami from the deli, or ground pork, or bacon, or leftover roast chicken \u2014 whatever you decide on, you\u2019ll need far less than you think. After the meat crisps, fish it from the pan and add about a tablespoon each of minced garlic and ginger, a handful of chopped scallions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds or so, then add those frozen vegetables. More stir-frying. Return the meat to the wok. Stir-fry. Clear a space in the center of the wok and add the eggs, cooking them quickly to softness. Throw in the sauce, then the rice, and mix it all together until it\u2019s steaming hot. Finish with more chopped scallions.\n<em>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up\u00a0to receive it.</a>\u00a0You can find more no-recipe recipes\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</em>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17NORECIPE-FRIED-RICE/merlin_147770727_1e7a6718-529c-42b7-91b8-57d7c43c4f6d-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, grains and rice, main course", "keywords": "egg, frozen vegetables, gochujang, rice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3400}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null, "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020016-whatever-youve-got-fried-rice"}
