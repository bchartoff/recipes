{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Clam-Chowder Pizza", "description": "The clam pizza is thought to have been born in New Haven at Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, in the middle of the last century, and has since made its way south to New York City. My recipe honors no one particular preparation but does pay homage to the clam pan roasts of the Grand Central Oyster Bar. It uses as sauce the building blocks of a classic clam chowder \u2014\u00a0alliums slowly fried with bacon, then infused with clam juice and wine, reduced to a glaze and thickened with cream \u2014\u00a0and tops it with chopped clams, lemon zest and a spray of hot pepper flakes. This makes for a heavy pie. If you\u2019re having a hard time moving it around on the pizza peel before baking, place a sheet of parchment paper beneath the dough, which will help when you slide the pie to the hot surface of the baking stone in the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/15/magazine/15eat-1/15eat-1-articleLarge-v2.gif", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pizza and calzones", "keywords": "bacon, clams, cream, leek, mozzarella, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 208}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 415, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "665 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 medium-size quahog clams, usually rated \u201ctop neck\u201d or \u201ccherrystone,\u201d rinsed", "1 1/2 cups dry white wine", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1/4 pound slab bacon, diced", "2 leeks, tops removed, halved and cleaned, then thinly sliced into half moons", "3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "3 tablespoons parsley, roughly chopped", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "1 9-to-10-ounce ball pizza dough, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016230-robertas-pizza-dough\">ideally homemade</a> (about 260 grams)", "2 3/4 ounces fresh mozzarella, roughly torn", "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "Calabrian or other red-pepper flakes, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven, and turn heat to its highest setting.
