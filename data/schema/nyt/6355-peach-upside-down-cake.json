{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach Upside-Down Cake", "description": "Peaches shine in this 1988 recipe. Ripe slices are coated with caramelized sugar, then a batter enhanced with just a bit of nutmeg. It's ready in 30 minutes, perfect for those warm days when turning on the oven feels impossible. It's best the day it's made, and kept unrefrigerated. One note: Your caramel might harden by the time you spread the batter on top of the peaches. Don't worry. It'll melt by the time it comes out of the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/dining/23COOKING-PEACH-UPSIDEDOWN-CAKE2/23COOKING-PEACH-UPSIDEDOWN-CAKE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butter, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, egg, flour, nutmeg, peach, sugar, dessert, nut-free, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1279}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 357, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "76 milligrams", "sugarContent": "39 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 pound/114 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan", "3 large, ripe peaches", "1 1/4 cup/250 grams sugar", "1 cup/128 grams flour", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "3 eggs", "3/4 cup\u00a0cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
