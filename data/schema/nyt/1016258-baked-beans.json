{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Beans", "description": "Proper Boston baked beans would have salt pork instead of the bacon. James Beard cooked them with ribs. The key is to use the little white pea beans known as navy beans, and to allow time to do most of the work. (Or to cheat: Canned white beans make fantastic baked beans in about an hour. If you use them, you'll need four 15-ounce cans. Drain and then follow the directions from step 2 on to the end. Please understand that you\u2019ll need much less water and much less time to get them where you want them to be.)  The combination of molasses and dry mustard is a taste as old as America itself, and takes well to both ham and soft brown bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/16/dining/16JPEASTER2/16JPEASTER2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "barbecue, new england", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "bacon, molasses, navy beans, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1054}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 343, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "253 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups navy beans", "Salt", "1/2 pound slab bacon, cut into cubes", "1 medium onion, peeled and chopped", "1/3 cup molasses", "2 teaspoons dry mustard", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak beans in a large bowl of water for 6 hours or overnight.
