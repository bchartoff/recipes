{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Pork and Pineapple", "description": "This recipe, an adaptation from \u201cThe Hakka Cookbook\u201d by Linda Lau Anusasananan, came to The Times by way of Mark Bittman in 2013. The Hakka people are sometimes thought of as the Jews of China, because they\u2019re dispersed all over the place. But the Hakkas cannot even point to an original homeland: you can find them everywhere. \u201cSome people call us dandelions, because we thrive in poor soil,\u201d says Ms. Anusasananan, who was born in California. Hakka dishes like this one, chow mein and pretty much anything in bean sauce, have defined Chinese-restaurant cooking for nearly everyone. This lively stir-fry comes together in about a half-hour and is easily doubled or tripled for a crowd. To make it more family- and weeknight-friendly, substitute sliced bell peppers for the fungus and canned pineapple for the fresh, and leave out (or greatly reduce) the chile peppers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/06/dining/06COOKING-STIR-FRIED-PORK-PINEAPPLE1/06COOKING-STIR-FRIED-PORK-PINEAPPLE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, weeknight", "keywords": "black fungus, boneless pork shoulder, pineapple, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 457}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 629, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "17 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1097 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces boneless pork shoulder or loin, trimmed of fat", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 teaspoon vegetable oil", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "8 pieces dried black fungus, like cloud ears, each about 1 inch wide (see note)", "3 scallions, including green tops", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 tablespoons thinly slivered fresh ginger", "8 ounces fresh pineapple, cut into 3/4-inch chunks (about 1 cup)", "5 to 8 thin rings fresh chile (preferably red)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the Pork", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the pork: Cut the pork into slices\n1/8 inch thick, 2 inches long and\n1 inch wide.
