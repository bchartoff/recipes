Chewy barley, crisp asparagus and peas lay in a broth bolstered by umami-rich soy sauce and miso. Hits of fresh ginger and vinegar enliven the mix. Feel free to swap in other vegetables that catch your eye: Add leeks and hearty greens with the barley, and quicker-cooking vegetables like sliced turnips or snap peas with the asparagus. Thinly slicing the asparagus makes it easier to eat with a spoon, but cut them larger if you prefer it. For more protein, add cubed soft or firm tofu to bowls, or stir a beaten egg into the pot as you would for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5847-hot-and-sour-soup?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=1\">hot and sour soup</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/as-spring-barley-soup/as-spring-barley-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, edamame, ginger, pearl barley, peas, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 548}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil, coconut oil or olive oil", "6 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped", "3/4 cup pearled barley", "1 tablespoon soy sauce, plus more to taste", "1 bunch asparagus (about 1 pound), tough ends trimmed, stalks thinly sliced 1/4-inch thick, tips left whole", "1 cup fresh or frozen shelled peas, edamame or fava beans", "3 tablespoons yellow or white miso", "1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated (about 1 tablespoon)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot or Dutch oven, add the oil and garlic, and heat over medium.
