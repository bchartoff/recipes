It looks like a standard buttercream-covered cake, but cut it open, and it reveals several fine pink vertical layers. The key is to make a thick, flexible sponge and turn it into a single jelly roll using three smaller, connecting pieces, joining them up as you go, then sitting it upright (check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK6c8gXIq6w\"> this video</a> for step-by-step instructions).
