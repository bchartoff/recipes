{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasteles", "description": "Most of the components for pasteles, a traditional Puerto Rican holiday dish, can be made a day or two in advance, then brought to room temperature for assembly. You can prepare the masa ahead, and freeze it for up to several months. Pasteles can also be cooked right away, refrigerated for a few days or frozen in zip-top containers for several months.\n\nSome use only green bananas or green plantains \u2013 which are unripe, firm and very green \u2013 for the masa; some add potatoes or pumpkin; some add yuca, also known as cassava, and others use only yuca. If you can\u2019t find one or more ingredients, use what you can find. Lucy Ramirez adds pork gravy to the masa (other cooks may add milk or oil) and makes sure there\u2019s a little pork in every bite of the pastel.\n\nTraditionally, pasteles were fully wrapped in banana or plantain leaves before being wrapped in parchment paper or foil. Today, many cooks use a piece or strip of banana leaf to give each pastel the nutty flavor of the leaf. Serve them with a side of hot sauce or ketchup.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2017/12/01/dining/how-to-make-pasteles/s/06PASTELES-slide-60ZG.html\">Click here to learn how to assemble the pasteles.</a>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rachel Wharton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/06/dining/06pastelesREX/06pastelesREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "36 pasteles, or 18 pairs", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "project, main course", "keywords": "ajicitos, annatto seeds, banana leaf, culantro, green banana, pimientos, plantain, pork shoulder, yautia, christmas, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 small ajicitos or aji dulce chiles, seeded", "1/3 large green bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped", "1/2 large red bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped", "1 small yellow onion, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup packed, stemmed culantro or chandon beni, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup stemmed cilantro, roughly chopped", "3 ounces (about 25) peeled garlic cloves", "1/4 cup drained jarred or canned pimientos", "8 pounds (about 3 bunches) green (unripe) bananas", "2 green (unripe) plantains", "2 pounds yautia, scrubbed and cleaned", "1 6-to-8-pound boneless pork shoulder or butt (or 2 smaller pieces)", "3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 packet (about 1 teaspoon) Saz\u00f3n Goya with Achiote and Culantro", "1 10-ounce jar green olives with pimentos, with their brine", "2 cups tomato sauce", "2 to 4 cups chicken stock or water", "Salt to taste", "2 cups vegetable oil", "1/4 cup annatto seeds", "36 pieces (4-by-5-inch)\u00a0banana leaf (from a 1-pound package of banana leaves, wiped clean)", "36 pieces (12-by-16-inch) precut parchment paper sheets", "18 50-inch pieces of kitchen or butcher\u2019s twine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sofrito: Place the chiles, bell peppers, onions, culantro, cilantro, garlic and pimentos in a blender and process until the mixture is fully pur\u00e9ed, scraping the sides of the blender as needed.

Take 2 to 3 cups of the liquid from the pork and stir it into the masa until it is the consistency of thick oatmeal, soft but spreadable.

To make each pastel, start with a piece of parchment paper in front of you, one long side closest to you. Use a soup spoon or a pastry brush to paint a very thin smear of annatto oil on the parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch border on the top and bottom and 4 inches on the sides. (This does not have to be perfect: It\u2019s just to keep the banana leaf from sticking.) Lay the banana leaf down on top of the oil, long side closest to you. Paint the banana leaf very lightly with the annatto oil. Spread 1/2 cup of masa on top of the banana leaf about 3/4  to 1/2 inch thick.

Your goal is really a line of pork chunks along the center of the masa, so that each bite of pastel has a bite of pork. Add 2 olives to the masa, one near each end.
