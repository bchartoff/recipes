{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lucky Peach Lamb Burgers", "description": "Peter Meehan, the sly genius who edited \"Lucky Peach,\" developed this dish for the magazine's cookbook, \"101 Easy Asian Recipes.\" I make it on a flat-top griddle set over a grill, but the method works equally well on your kitchen stove. The burgers are a take on a dish served in Xi\u2019an, the capital city of Shaanxi province in northwestern China, at the easternmost terminus of the Silk Road. Cumin and chile, along with some Sichuan peppercorns if you can find them, bring a bright funkiness to ground lamb, which crisps up beautifully on top of a bed of saut\u00e9ed red onion and jalape\u00f1o pepper. Put the patties into potato buns, and serve under a spray of cilantro leaves. It's a meal you could cook twice a month for the better part of a year.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/magazine/06eat2/06mag-06eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 burgers", "recipeCuisine": "american, chinese", "recipeCategory": "burgers", "keywords": "lamb", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 464}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 365, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "325 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground lamb", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, toasted and crushed (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon red chile flakes", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, like canola", "1 small red onion, halved, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 jalape\u00f1o, halved, seeded and thinly sliced", "Potato buns, for serving", "Cilantro leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Create a flat-top cooking surface on a gas grill by using a couple of large cast-iron skillets, or a thick metal sheet like a Baking Steel, or soapstone cooking tiles.
