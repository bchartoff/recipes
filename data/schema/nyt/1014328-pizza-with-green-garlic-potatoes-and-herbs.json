{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pizza With Green Garlic, Potatoes and Herbs", "description": "Pizza is many things to many people, but one thing it usually is not: is healthy. But in any pizzeria in Rome or Naples, you\u2019ll find a dizzying array of offerings that really are healthy. The crusts are thin, often topped with seasonal vegetables, and the slices are reasonably sized. There may be cheese on top, but not more than a few ounces. The crust for this recipe is made with half whole wheat flour and is wholesome but light and full of flavor. This week\u2019s pizza recipes also make for a handy way to sabotage the picky habits of vegetable-averse kids. Just tell them they\u2019re having pizza for dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/05/25/health/25recipehealth_600/25recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "One 12- or 14-inch pizza", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "green garlic, waxy potato, whole wheat flour, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "1 cup warm water", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing the pizza crusts", "1 1/4 cups stone ground whole wheat flour", "1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus additional if necessary for kneading", "1 1/4 teaspoons salt", "1 bulb green garlic, sliced; or if the bulb has formed cloves, 4 cloves, sliced thin", "1/2 pound new potatoes or other waxy potatoes, scrubbed", "Salt", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 recipe whole wheat pizza dough", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, or 1 teaspoon crumbled dried rosemary, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the whole wheat pizza dough", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the yeast and water in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup.
