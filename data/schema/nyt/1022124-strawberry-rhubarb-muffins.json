{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry-Rhubarb Muffins", "description": "While rhubarb works wonderfully in baked goods, baking strawberries into scones or muffins can be a little bit more of a challenge. Though delightfully sweet and fragrant when fresh, baked strawberries have a tendency to become watery and bland. This recipe solves that problem by macerating the diced rhubarb and strawberries with sugar before folding them into the muffin batter. Doing so not only draws out excess moisture from the strawberries, but also gets a head start on breaking down the fibrous rhubarb. This recipe calls for an ample amount of sugar, which balances the tartness of the rhubarb and helps create wonderfully browned and chewy muffin tops. Finally, the cornmeal in this recipe adds great texture and gives the muffins a rustic finish. Opt for medium-grind or stone-ground cornmeal, if you can find it, but fine cornmeal works well, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/19/dining/lh-strawberry-rhubarb-muffins/merlin_186367197_1768e82f-0cfe-4ad3-b165-7e790a4a6955-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack, quick breads, dessert", "keywords": "cornmeal, muffin, rhubarb, strawberry, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 549}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray (optional)", "1 cup small-diced fresh strawberries (about 6 ounces/170 grams)", "1 cup small-diced fresh rhubarb (about 4 ounces/113 grams)", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted and slightly cooled", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup/227 grams sour cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Zest of 1 lemon", "1 1/2 cups/192 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/60 grams medium-grind or fine cornmeal", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 tablespoon Demerara or turbinado sugar, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and line a standard muffin tin with paper liners.
