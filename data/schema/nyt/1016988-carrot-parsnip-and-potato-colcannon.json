{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carrot, Parsnip and Potato Colcannon", "description": "In anticipation of Thanksgiving, I was playing around with colcannon, thinking it would be nice to make this year\u2019s mashed potatoes with a twist. Colcannon is an Irish dish that traditionally pairs mashed potatoes with cabbage or kale. I decided to broaden the range of combinations, choosing different vegetables to mix with the potatoes, and used carrots and parsnips to great effect.\n\nCarrots and parsnips, whose flavors are quite similar, outweigh the potatoes in this sweet, light version. Scallions are traditional in colcannon, but I wanted something with a bit more substance, so I used leeks instead. I cooked them until soft in a little olive oil and stirred them into the pur\u00e9e with warm milk and butter. The resulting mashed potatoes are beautiful, delicious and healthful, too. Because parsnips can be fibrous, I recommend straining the pur\u00e9e or putting it through a food mill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/dining/12MARTHA/MARTHA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "carrot, parsnip, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 49}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 216, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "588 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed", "1 pound carrots, peeled, quartered and cut into 3-inch lengths", "1 pound parsnips, peeled, quartered, cored and cut into 3-inch lengths", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium leek, white and light green parts only, cleaned and chopped", "2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, to taste", "3/4 cup milk", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill or chervil, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place potatoes, carrots and parsnips in a saucepan and cover by an inch with water.
