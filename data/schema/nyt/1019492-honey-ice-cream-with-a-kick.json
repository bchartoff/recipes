{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Honey Ice Cream With a Kick", "description": "For this velvety, sweet ice cream with a subtle but throat-tickling kick, the chef Fany Gerson draws inspiration from her favorite honey ice cream recipe, by the cookbook author and pastry chef David Lebovitz, as well as her chile-laden childhood in Mexico. Ms. Gerson serves it as part of a Rosh Hashana feast, but it is a seasonless treat. Her toppings \u2014 chunks of creamy Manila mangoes dusted with ground red chiles, plus puffed amaranth for crunch \u2014 make it an interesting, almost sundae-like dessert. The ice cream is very soft right out of the machine, like soft serve; freeze it for at least 6 hours for something more scoopable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/05/dining/05fanyrex4/05fanyrex4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 quart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dessert, heavy cream, honey, hot honey, milk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 23}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 251, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "130 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 2/3 cup/400 milliliters whole milk", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "5 large egg yolks", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters heavy cream", "1/3 cup floral or fruity honey", "2 to 4 tablespoons hot honey, such as Mike\u2019s Hot Honey", "Fresh mango chunks; ground pequ\u00edn, \u00e1rbol or other ground chiles; and puffed amaranth, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a strainer over a medium bowl, then place that bowl over a large bowl of ice water.
