{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Scallops With Sorrel Butter", "description": "Sorrel is a wonderfully pungent, tart spring green that takes well to rich and sweet ingredients. Here, it\u2019s melted into a garlicky, buttery pan sauce and served with seared scallops. One thing to note: as sorrel cooks, it dims from bright green to olive drab in color. But a garnish of chives \u2013 with the chive blossoms if you can get them \u2013 will perk things up considerably. If you can\u2019t find sorrel, you can make this dish with watercress or spinach, though you may need to add a squirt of lemon juice at the end to balance the flavors.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/08/multimedia/clark-scallops-sorrel/clark-scallops-sorrel-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, quick, one pot", "keywords": "butter, scallops, sorrel, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 273}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 173, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "468 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n", "1 pound sea scallops, patted dry\n", "Kosher salt and black pepper, as needed", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 tablespoon dry white vermouth or white wine", "4 ounces sorrel (about 3 cups loosely packed), stems removed", "2 tablespoons chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high.
