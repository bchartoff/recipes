{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Halloumi With Corn, Cherry Tomatoes and Basil", "description": "Seared cubes of halloumi get melty and soft on their insides and dark brown and a little crisp on the surface, making it almost impossible not to devour them all as they come out of the pan. But try to resist, because they\u2019re even better tossed with a quick saut\u00e9 of summer corn and tomatoes, seasoned with basil. Slivers of red onions, folded in raw at the end, add crunch and sweetness, while a squeeze of fresh lime makes everything tangy and fresh. Although this dish is at its most sublime made with fresh summer corn and ripe tomatoes, it\u2019s nearly as good in winter made with frozen corn. Serve it for a light, meatless dinner or a substantial side dish with roasted or grilled chicken or fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/12/dining/12appetite-corn-halloumi/13appetite-corn-halloumi-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "basil, cherry tomatoes, corn, halloumi, salad, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1981}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "12 to 14 ounces halloumi cheese, diced into 1-inch cubes and patted dry", "2 cups corn kernels, fresh or frozen and thawed (from 2 to 3 ears of corn)", "2 cups halved cherry tomatoes", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded or not, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste", "3/4 cup thinly sliced red onion", "1/2 cup chopped fresh basil, more as garnish", "1 lime, cut into wedges", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, preferably nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high until it thins out, about 20 seconds.
