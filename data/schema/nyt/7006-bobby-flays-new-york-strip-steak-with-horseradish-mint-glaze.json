{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bobby Flay\u2019s New York Strip Steak With Horseradish-Mint Glaze", "description": "This simple yet exquisite preparation for steak was developed by Bobby Flay, the restaurateur and Food Network star, in 2003. It's the sort of steak dinner you can easily prepare on a weeknight, but also guest-worthy. Start with the best steaks you can afford without mortgaging the house, then season with a combination of ground black pepper, ancho chile powder, and salt. Sear in a blazingly hot pan slicked with a little canola oil, then slide them into the oven for about 10 minutes. Remove and brush them with a flavorful glaze of Dijon mustard, horseradish, honey and fresh mint, then return to the oven to finish.
