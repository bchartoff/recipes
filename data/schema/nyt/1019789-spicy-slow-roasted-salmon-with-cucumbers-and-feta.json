Dried chile, fennel and coriander provide a crunchy bite and sneaky heat to the buttery salmon. Serve it warm or at room temperature, with cucumbers, drizzles of more spicy oil, and feta, for a little more plushness. Store any leftover salmon for up to 2 days in the oil, so it doesn\u2019t dry out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/27/dining/as-chile-roasted-salmon/as-chile-roasted-salmon-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "cucumber, feta, salmon, low-carb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 777}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 631, "unsaturatedFatContent": "36 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "520 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 1/2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1 tablespoon fennel seeds, crushed", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds, crushed", "Kosher salt and black\u00a0pepper", "1 (2-pound) skinless salmon fillet", "1 large English cucumber or 3 Persian cucumbers", "4 ounces feta, crumbled (about 1 cup)", "1/4 cup parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 300 degrees.
