{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Crunchiest Summer Fruit Crumble", "description": "The secret to this fruit crumble is to bake the sweet, cinnamon-scented topping separately, to dry it out. Then when you pile those crumbs over a mound of juicy summer fruit, they won\u2019t absorb as much liquid, and stay crisp and cookielike. You can make the crumbs a day ahead. But the crumble is best baked on the day you serve it, preferably while still a little warm and brimming with syrupy fruit. Make sure to taste your fruit before adding the sugar. Sweeter fruit like strawberries, cherries and blueberries need less sugar than tart plums and nectarines. A spoonful of whipped cream or ice cream makes this even better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/08/dining/08Appetite-a/merlin_173816487_47d9353f-99db-471b-acc0-de545e6c3d24-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, cookies and bars, pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "berries, cherries, ice cream, nectarine, peach, rolled oats, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 985}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/50 grams rolled oats", "1/3 cup/75 grams light or dark brown sugar", "1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, ginger or allspice, or use lemon zest", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted and cooled", "2 to 5 tablespoon light brown sugar (or granulated sugar), depending on the sweetness of the fruit", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "8 cups mixed berries (fresh or frozen), or cubed peaches, plums, nectarines, apricots, or pitted sweet cherries (or a combination)", "Ice cream or whipped cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the topping: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, oats, sugars, salt and spices.
