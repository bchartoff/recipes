If your palate favors more robust, bitter flavors, sub in a more forceful, bitter-leaning amaro. Fan of smoke-forward drinks? Woodsy, rich Amaro Sfumato Rabarbaro is your friend here. No matter what amaro you choose, the lemon will brighten, and a full ounce of blanc vermouth fills out the drink, providing a temper to Scotch\u2019s smoky heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/dining/24smokerex2-bitter/merlin_198116952_9826e405-b179-4621-9f21-d94e37de5e14-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 158}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces Scotch", "1 ounce blanc vermouth", "3/4 ounce amaro", "1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice", "Ice", "Lemon peel, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a shaker, combine the scotch, blanc vermouth, amaro and lemon juice.
