{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cold Brew Coffee, Pro Style", "description": "Camila Ramos, a founder of the Miami coffee shop All Day, has worked out a formulation that will appeal to coffee obsessives who are ready to take their cold brew to the next level.\n\nAll Day uses paper filter bags from the brand <a href=\"https://toddycafe.com/shop-product/211/Toddy-Paper-Filter-Bags\">Toddy</a>. These filters can rip, so you should first line the steeping container with a large reusable <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pinfox-Reusable-Strainer-Filter-Coffee/dp/B071XN8Y3X\">food-safe nylon mesh bag</a>. The steeping container must be large enough so that the coffee and water take up no more than two-thirds of the volume.\n\nLook for a local roaster, as they roast beans for the water in your area, and try to buy beans that have been roasted 21 to 28 days earlier. (You can always buy a younger coffee and let it rest.) Fresher coffees tend to be more volatile in cold brew. This recipe calls for gently agitating the coffee slurry for a full 5 minutes, which will feel like an eternity. Don\u2019t cut it short. This step is crucial to the extraction process, and will give your cold brew coffee a more dynamic flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Oliver Strand"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/07/dining/07COLDBREW1-copy/07COLDBREW1-copy-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 quarts/1 1/2 liters coffee concentrate", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "coffee", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 114}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 0, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": null, "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "4 milligrams", "sugarContent": null, "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/500 grams coffee", "2 quarts/2 liters water, filtered"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grind coffee at a medium setting: slightly finer than what you would use for a French press and slightly coarser than what you would use for a pour-over."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a 4-quart/4-liter container with the nylon mesh bag, draping the edges over the side of the pot.
