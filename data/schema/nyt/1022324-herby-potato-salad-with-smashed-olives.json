{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herby Potato Salad With Smashed Olives", "description": "As with coleslaw, there are two schools of potato salad: the mayonnaise-based and the vinegar-based. This recipe plants itself firmly in the latter camp with bright, punchy flavors. The dressing here is a classic red-wine vinegar and Dijon vinaigrette that develops great flavor after marinating with capers, smashed green olives and thinly sliced shallots. Just fifteen minutes in the dressing softens the shallot\u2019s bite, and a quick soak brings canned olives to life. There may appear to be too much dressing when you add the cooked potatoes, but as the potatoes cool, they\u2019ll absorb it beautifully. (The key is to add them to the dressing as soon as they are cool enough to handle.) Any small potatoes will work for this recipe, and a mix of colors looks particularly nice. The most important detail is that the potatoes should be roughly the same size so that they cook evenly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/17/dining/lh-potato-salad/merlin_188895786_5c74f57b-24a9-4d0f-8a5a-9cece0630855-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "side dish", "keywords": "herbs, olives, potato, potato salad, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 575}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds small (or baby) red or Yukon Gold potatoes, all about the same size", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/3 cup olive oil", "1 cup Castelvetrano or other green olives, pitted and smashed (about 4 ounces)", "1 large shallot, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons capers, roughly chopped", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the potatoes in a large pot; add 2 teaspoons salt and enough water to cover generously.
