{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Khachapuri Adjaruli (Georgian Cheese Bread Boat)", "description": "There are many different styles of khachapuri, the signature stuffed cheese bread of Georgia, but most are made by wrapping a pile of cheese in a round of dough, then baking until the cheese is molten. The most famous khachapuri is from Adjara, a region of Georgia on the Black Sea. It\u2019s an open-faced, boat-shaped loaf that\u2019s often served with an egg yolk and a slice of butter to stir in at the table. Traditionally, tangy imeruli and sulguni cheeses are used, but they are difficult to find in the U.S. This recipe, which is adapted from \u201cGeorgian Khachapuri and Filled Breads\u201d by Carla Capalbo (Pallas Athene Publishers, 2018), uses a blend of mozzarella, feta and goat cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/dining/dg-khachapuri/dg-khachapuri-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 entr\u00e9es or 4 appetizers", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, breads, dips and spreads, finger foods, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "butter, feta, flour, goat cheese, mozzarella, pizza dough, sugar, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 903}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose or bread flour", "3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "12 ounces store-bought pizza dough, or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12399-mark-bittmans-basic-pizza-dough\">homemade\u00a0pizza dough</a> completed through Step 2", "1 cup/100 grams shredded whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella (not fresh mozzarella)", "1/3 cup/40 grams goat cheese, finely crumbled", "1/3 cup/40 grams drained, finely crumbled brined feta (not low-fat or light)", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted, plus 2 tablespoons cold butter for serving (optional)", "1 egg yolk from 1 large egg (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough (but if you're using store-bought, proceed to Step 2): In a small saucepan over low, heat 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/150 milliliters water until hot but not simmering.
