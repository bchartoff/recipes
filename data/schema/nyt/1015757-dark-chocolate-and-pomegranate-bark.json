{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dark Chocolate and Pomegranate Bark", "description": "Chocolate bark is the workhorse of homemade holiday gifts, and in Tom Faglon's version, he scatters fresh pomegranate seeds over the surface, where they glisten like rubies. Chewy bits of candied ginger are hidden inside the bittersweet chocolate, lying in wait to surprise you with their spiciness. Then, to make things even more interesting, Mr. Faglon strews the top with crunchy sea salt. This bark is as sweet and juicy as a box of chocolate-covered cherries, but a lot more sophisticated.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/29/dining/video-clark-pomegranate-bark/video-clark-pomegranate-bark-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 3/4 pound of bark (8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chocolate, pomegranate seeds, dessert, gluten-free, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 353}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 115, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "101 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["140 grams dark (bittersweet) chocolate pieces (5 ounces)", "20 grams minced crystallized ginger (2 tablespoons)", "140 grams fresh pomegranate seeds (1 cup)", "6 grams flaky sea salt (1 teaspoon)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fit a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, making sure the water doesn\u2019t touch the bottom of the bowl.
