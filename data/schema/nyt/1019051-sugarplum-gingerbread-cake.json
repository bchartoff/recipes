Ms. Ko's cake uses oil, not butter, which gives the crumb a fluffy, moist texture. The liquid base of rehydrated prunes brings sweetness along with depth of flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/19/magazine/19feast-recipe2-bundt/19feast-recipe2-bundt-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cinnamon, cloves, cocoa powder, ginger, molasses, prune, spelt flour, whole wheat flour, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 197}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 222, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "160 milligrams", "sugarContent": "28 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup (184 grams) pitted prunes, quartered", "2/3 cup (214 grams) molasses", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "Butter or cooking spray, for the pan", "1 cup (137 grams) spelt flour", "3/4 cup (108 grams) white whole-wheat flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup (215 grams) packed light-brown sugar", "1/4 cup (56 grams) grapeseed or other neutral oil", "2 teaspoons cocoa powder (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the prunes along with 1 1/2 cups water in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil.
