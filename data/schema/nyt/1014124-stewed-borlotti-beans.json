The beer\u2019s bitter, hoppy finish has touches of smoke and spice, like the rich meat. But its relatively light body balances the succulence of the sandwich.Taking the deli icon as my inspiration, I simmered some borlotti beans (kidney, black or cannellini beans would do just as well) with chunks of pastrami instead of the more usual smoked pork or sausages. Mustard seeds, cumin and black pepper picked up the seasonings in the meat. The caraway suggested seeded rye. For a final grace note, I swirled in some prepared mustard.Serve the beans for a hearty lunch or supper, with slabs of sturdy rye bread and pickles.
