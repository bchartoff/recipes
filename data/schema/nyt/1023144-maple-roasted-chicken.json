{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple Roasted Chicken", "description": "This sweet, well-seasoned dish is great for Sunday dinner. You only have to marinate for an hour, but you could do it up to overnight. Set it up the night before, then simply roast the chicken just before serving. The sticky glaze adds color, but its sweetness is not overpowering, getting some good balance from the vinegar and the smoky paprika. Pair the roasted chicken with sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts or bitter greens, like collard greens and kale, and use any leftovers in a salad or rice bowl the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/20/dining/mp-maple-chicken/merlin_203952036_4e939e32-f74f-4c79-a202-f100706cc782-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, maple syrup, smoked paprika", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 871}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)", "1/4 cup pure maple syrup", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/3 cup pure maple syrup", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 teaspoon ground fennel", "1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using paper towels, pat the chicken dry and trim off any excess fat.
