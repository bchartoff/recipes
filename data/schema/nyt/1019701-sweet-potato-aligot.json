{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Aligot", "description": "In a classic French <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018430-aligot-mashed-potatoes-with-cheese\">pommes aligot</a> potatoes are mashed with butter and enough cheese to turn them into a stretchy pur\u00e9e that\u2019s soft, gooey and eminently comforting. This version, made with sweet potatoes, has a gently caramelized flavor and a deeply satiny texture. Pan-fried sage leaves make a crisp, herbal garnish that\u2019s worth the few extra minutes of work. Note that the bigger the sage leaves, the easier they are to fry. If you can\u2019t find Saint-Nectaire or Tomme de Savoie cheese, you can use fontina or mozzarella. And if you want to make this ahead, or reheat leftovers, let the mixture cool, then store it in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat it on low, stirring in a little cream until the mixture is elastic and smooth. Serve this as a side dish to sausages or roasted meats, or as a meatless entree with a fresh, crunchy salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/14/dining/14apperex1/merlin_146213454_db2f2d3b-9994-496a-9d97-00870eb9c5c0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, winter, gruy\u00e8re, heavy cream, sage, sweet potato, thyme, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 155}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 452, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "443 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks", "Kosher salt", "Grapeseed, olive or sunflower oil", "Leaves from 1 small bunch sage", "1 thyme or lemon thyme\u00a0sprig", "1/4 cup heavy cream", "6 tablespoons unsalted\u00a0butter, cubed", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "Large pinch of freshly grated nutmeg", "8 ounces grated\u00a0Gruy\u00e8re, Cheddar or\u00a0Emmentaler\u00a0cheese", "5 ounces Saint-Nectaire or Tomme de Savoie cheese, rind removed, cubed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, cover the potatoes and a generous amount of salt with 1 inch of water.
