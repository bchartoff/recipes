{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sabl\u00e9 Breton Galette With Berries", "description": "The sabl\u00e9 is a sweet shortbread that\u2019s buttery and noticeably salty. In this version, the dough is purposely very soft (it\u2019s too soft to roll and cut for cookies) so that it can be patted and pressed into a tart pan, baked, and used as the base of a beautiful berry dessert. You can spread the galette with lemon curd and top it with sliced strawberries or whole raspberries, but it is equally good with whipped cream or ice cream in place of the curd. In fact, it\u2019s good on its own \u2014 just cut it into wedges. If you\u2019re not serving a group, leave the galette plain, and when you need a slice or three of tart, cut the galette and top it on the spot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Weinstein"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/dining/19COOKING_GALETTEWBERRIES/19COOKING_GALETTEWBERRIES-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, lunch", "keywords": "berries, dough, pastry, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 487, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "296 milligrams", "sugarContent": "39 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup all-purpose flour", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2/3 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel or \u00bc teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large egg", "About 1 cup lemon curd", "About 3 cups berries (strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries, or a mix of these)", "Red currant jelly, for glazing (optional)", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the galette: Whisk the flour and baking powder together."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy.
