{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Chops With Green Tomatoes", "description": "Lamb chops cooked with tomatoes is traditional, but less so when the tomatoes are green. Here, unripe, green tomatoes add acidity, which works nicely with the rich gaminess of the shoulder chops. If you can\u2019t get green tomatoes, you can make this with the half-green, half-red tomatoes, the kind that haven\u2019t fully ripened on the vine before they need to be picked in advance of a frost. In a pinch you can even use tomatillos or bland, out-of-season supermarket tomatoes, which will add the necessary juiciness and vegetable matter to the pan if not the same complexity of flavor (a squeeze of lemon would help). In any case, make sure to taste before stirring in the honey, since the acid content of tomatoes varies widely. And if you aren\u2019t a lamb lover but are wondering what to do with a plethora of green tomatoes, you can make this recipe with pork chops; just add a few minutes to the cooking time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/17/multimedia/clark-lamb/clark-lamb-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops", "keywords": "anchovy, green tomato, lamb chops, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 166}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 553, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "579 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (1-inch thick) bone-in shoulder lamb chops or boneless sirloin lamb chops", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, more as needed", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "2 large shallots, chopped", "6 anchovy fillets", "3 1/2 cups diced green tomatoes (2 to 3 tomatoes)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 to 2 teaspoons honey, to taste", "1/2 cup chopped fresh basil, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season lamb chops with coriander, salt and pepper.
