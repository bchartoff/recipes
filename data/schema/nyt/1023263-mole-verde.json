{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mole Verde", "description": "Among the seven most well-known mole varieties, tomatillo-based mole verde is one of the easiest to prepare because of its use of fresh chiles and herbs rather than dried chiles and spices. Romaine, cilantro and epazote get blended into the mole of seared chiles, garlic, onion and toasted nuts and seeds to make an earthy sauce. Fresh epazote and hoja santa add depth of flavor, with unique notes of pungency and anise, but they can be tough to find, so dried options can be used. This mole can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months, ready for weeknights when all you want to do is warm up some tortillas and mushrooms for a perfect taco, or you could serve it over <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016674-mexican-rice\">Mexican rice</a> with roasted cauliflower.\u00a0\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/09/dining/jr-mole-verde/merlin_207624078_28913220-b43f-41b5-9478-01ca0bfe0cc9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 cups (8 to 10 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "cilantro, epazote, healthy, hoja santa, pepitas, poblano pepper, tomatillo, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 376}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 medium tomatillos (about 1 pound), peeled and washed\u00a0", "1 large poblano\u00a0", "\u00bd medium yellow onion, quartered", "2 to 3 serrano chiles\u00a0", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 cup brown (unhulled) sesame seeds", "\u00bd cup raw pepitas", "\u00bd cup raw almonds", "2 dried bay leaves", "2 to 3 cloves", "6 large romaine lettuce leaves", "1 medium bunch cilantro, torn in half", "8 large fresh epazote leaves", "1 medium fresh or dried hoja santa leaf (optional)", "2 \u00bd cups vegetable stock, plus more if needed", "\u00bc cup neutral cooking oil (such as grapeseed)", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "Seared mushrooms, tofu steaks, roasted cauliflower and/or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016674-mexican-rice\"><span>Mexican rice</span></a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the tomatillos, poblano, onion, serrano chiles and garlic to a large preheated comal or cast-iron skillet set over medium heat.
