{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eintopf (Braised Short Ribs With Fennel, Squash and Sweet Potato)", "description": "There are as many versions of eintopf, a hearty German stew, as there are people who love it. A traditional eintopf may include bratwurst and sauerkraut, but it\u2019s how it is cooked that\u2019s important (eintopf translates to \u201cone pot\u201d). This particular recipe, made with bone-in short ribs, is braised until the meat melts off the bone. Fennel \u2014 fresh bulb and dried seeds \u2014 stars in the braise, while the fronds are sliced for garnishing. Every bite of this stew bursts with flavor, and, as is the case with so many one-pot meals, this dish will only improve with time as all the ingredients sit and mingle. Serve this hot off the stove, with some warm crusty bread for dipping. If you plan to save it for later, reserve the fresh greens for stirring in right before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/16/dining/11Komolafe-rex/merlin_200470188_e8848b6a-871a-4cdb-95ba-6d56d541b772-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "german", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butternut squash, coconut milk, dutch oven, fennel, fennel seeds, short ribs, sweet potato, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 883}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds meaty, bone-in short ribs, cut into single-bone portions", "Salt", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed, canola or vegetable oil", "1 small fennel bulb, trimmed and chopped (about 2 1/4 cups), top with fronds separated from bulb and thinly sliced", "6 shallots, peeled and halved lengthwise", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes", "4 cups chicken stock", "1 white sweet potato, such as Japanese sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces, or use an orange sweet potato (2 loose cups)", "1/2 small butternut squash (about 1 pound 3 ounces), seeds removed, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces", "1 (14 1/2-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, scrubbed and grated", "4 cups torn or cut fresh greens, such as kale, mature spinach, mustard greens or dandelion greens", "Warm crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the short ribs with a sprinkle of salt on all sides.
