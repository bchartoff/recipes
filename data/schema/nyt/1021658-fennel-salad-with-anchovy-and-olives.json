{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fennel Salad With Anchovy and Olives", "description": "This salad is a zesty first course or a fine lunch. A range of sharp flavors \u2014 garlic, anchovy, lemon and briny olives \u2014 contrast beautifully with the anise-scented fennel bulb. Dress the salad just before serving, so the sliced fennel stays crisp.\u00a0It may seem silly to smash and pit your own green olives, but they look better and taste meatier that way. In any case, please don\u2019t cut pitted olives crosswise into little slices.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/02/dining/25Tanisrex1-salad/merlin_180342159_d1117082-4675-4da2-af44-88a7cf61f8e9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, appetizer", "keywords": "anchovy, eggs, fennel, garlic, lemon, olives, preserved lemon, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 217}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 anchovy fillets, rinsed, blotted dry and roughly chopped", "3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus 1 teaspoon lemon zest (from 2 large lemons)", "2 tablespoons finely diced preserved lemon, rinsed and blotted dry (optional)", "2 small garlic cloves, grated or mashed to a paste", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3 medium fennel bulbs, trimmed and thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "About 1/2 cup\u00a0green olives,\u00a0such as Castelvetrano or Lucques, smashed and pits removed (about 16 olives)", "4 hard-boiled eggs (8 minutes), peeled and halved", "Extra anchovy fillets, for garnish (optional)", "Handful of Italian parsley leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: Put chopped anchovies, lemon juice and zest, preserved lemon (if using) and garlic in a small bowl.
