{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn Salad With Mango and Halloumi", "description": "This salad brings together some of summer\u2019s best and brightest ingredients: corn, mango and cucumbers. A perfect, just-ripe mango provides sweetness as a counterbalance to the saltiness of fried halloumi. The cheese is fairly easy to find in supermarkets, but if you are looking for an alternative, you can use queso blanco, which is less salty, but fries in a similar way. (For best results, fry the cheese just before you are ready to eat.) Pita chips turn this into a heartier meal. You can also wrap the salad in corn tortillas and serve with guacamole.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a> newsletter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/26/dining/hm-corn-and-mango-salad/merlin_191247258_f064d917-dc2a-43a9-9b63-331853c0d4f4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "cilantro, corn on the cob, halloumi, mint, pita chips", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 603}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika", "Black pepper", "3 ears of corn, husks removed", "2 (8-ounce) blocks halloumi cheese, drained and cut into 3/4-inch cubes", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large just-ripe mango, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces", "3 Persian or mini cucumbers (about 1/2 pound), unpeeled, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/4 cup chopped mint leaves", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "2 scallions, finely sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 ounces pita chips, crumbled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the vinaigrette, place the olive oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, cumin and smoked paprika in a large bowl and whisk until combined.
