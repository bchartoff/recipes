{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rock-Shrimp Roll", "description": "Rock shrimp are meaty and firm, like lobster tail, and have a mild, bland flavor that can really use the help of seasoning at several stages. So we salt them before cooking and during cooking. Once the shrimp are mixed with onion and celery and mayonnaise, taste the shrimp salad as a whole to decide if it could stand even another pinch of salt or grind of pepper. But use unsalted butter on the bun when griddling, to get the perfect play between the sweet and the saline.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/30/magazine/30mag-eat/48bcfb92f92f4965a83b73fa9ad61f13-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, sandwiches, seafood", "keywords": "dill, egg, endive, rock shrimp, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 133}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "1 1/2 pounds peeled raw rock shrimp", "1/2 of 1 small white onion, finely minced", "1 small celery rib from inner core, finely minced", "5 tablespoons mayonnaise (Hellmann\u2019s or Best Foods only!)", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 large, bushy branches of dill, stems removed, feathery leaves chopped", "1/2 of 1 lemon", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "4 hot dog buns, preferably potato", "2 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled then sliced into thin rounds using an egg slicer", "1 small red or green Belgian endive, cut crosswise into thin coins"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a stockpot, bring 2 1/2 quarts of water to a rolling boil, and add the 1/2 cup salt.
