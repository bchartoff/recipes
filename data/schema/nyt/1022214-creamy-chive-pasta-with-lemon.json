{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Chive Pasta With Lemon", "description": "This recipe is a good way to showcase any fresh chives you may have. In the spirit of buttered noodles with chives \u2014 or stir-fried lo mein with Chinese chives \u2014 this recipe uses the delicate alliums as an ingredient instead of a garnish. Their gentle onion flavor adds freshness to lemon-cream sauce, which is not unlike a delicate sour cream and onion dip. You can use cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche for more tang, heavy cream for an Alfredo vibe, or ricotta for a hint of sweetness. To use another spring allium like ramps, leeks or a combination, thinly slice and simmer in heavy cream (not cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or ricotta) to soften before adding the other ingredients.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/10/dining/as-creamy-chive-pasta/merlin_187482177_4cf7fb49-d5d3-4d9a-b755-4c053853c8be-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "chives, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, heavy cream, lemon juice, linguine, parmesan, ricotta, spaghetti, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1486}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound long noodles, like linguine or spaghetti", "3/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, heavy cream or ricotta", "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (1 3/4 ounces), plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest plus 3 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)", "1/4 to 1 1/2 ounces chives, cut into 1-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
