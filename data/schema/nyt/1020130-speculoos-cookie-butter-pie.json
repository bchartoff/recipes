{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Speculoos Cookie Butter Pie", "description": "Traditionally served on St. Nicholas Day in Belgium and the Netherlands, crisp, gingerbread-like speculoos cookies have risen in popularity after airlines began offering them as mid-flight snacks. Cookie butter, a creamy spread, incorporate that cookie\u2019s flavors. This easy pie uses crumbled speculoos (also known as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015652-speculaas\">speculaas</a>) in its crust and the cookie butter in its filling, doubling up on the flavor of warm spices like cinnamon and ginger. The whole thing comes together in about 30 minutes. The pie is perfect all on its own, but if you want to dress it up, add some unsweetened whipped cream and a sprinkle of cookie crumbs. Avoid sweetened whipped cream, which would take this pie from sweet to cloying.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/28/dining/em-cookie-butter-cream-pie/merlin_152025021_0161c8fa-4764-4738-b7a8-8c8a435c7998-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, cookie butter, cream cheese, graham crackers, heavy cream, speculoos, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 226}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 336, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "145 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "30 speculoos cookies or about 10 graham crackers (8 ounces/227 grams), plus more for garnish (optional)", "4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter, melted", "8 ounces/230 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "1 cup/280 grams speculoos cookie butter", "1 cup/125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters heavy cream, plus\u00a03/4 cup/180 milliliters heavy cream for topping (optional)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly spray a 9-inch pie plate with nonstick spray."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the cookies into fine crumbs, about 1 minute.
