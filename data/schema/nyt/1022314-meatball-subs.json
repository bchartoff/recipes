{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meatball Subs", "description": "In this classic Italian American sandwich, tender meatballs drenched in tomato sauce are tucked into crisp rolls then buried under a blanket of gooey cheese. It\u2019s a messy sandwich no matter how you build it or bite into it, but wise construction can help: First, hollow out the rolls a bit so the meatballs have a place to sit. Then, use the leftover crumbs to make the meatballs, which will keep them light. Finally, toast the rolls to prevent them from getting too soggy with sauce. Of course, some crispy-gone-soggy bites are welcome, just as the cheese pulls, sauce drips and messy fingers are, too. They\u2019re all part of the experience.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/14/dining/as-meatball-subs/as-meatball-subs-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, meatballs, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "ground beef, italian american, marinara sauce, mozzarella, parmesan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 973}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6-inch-long) sub, hero or hoagie rolls, split lengthwise but still attached on one side", "1 egg", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for greasing", "1 pound ground beef (at least 15 percent fat)", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons chopped basil leaves, plus more for serving", "2 cups marinara sauce (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016147-simple-marinara-sauce\">homemade</a> or from a 24-ounce jar)", "4 slices mozzarella or provolone"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler to high with a rack no more than 6 inches from the heat source.
