{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Gazpacho", "description": "This silky, salmon-colored puree is called salmorejo in Cordoba, Spain, where it originated. It\u2019s thicker than gazpacho Andaluz, just a simple mixture of tomatoes, bread, garlic and olive oil. Its success depends entirely on the quality of the tomatoes and oil. Authentic salmorejo has about three times as much olive oil as this version and can be thicker, doubling as a sauce or a dip. Traditionally, the soup is garnished with Ib\u00e9rico or Serrano ham and diced hard-boiled eggs, but I like to garnish mine with diced green pepper or, for some spice, diced poblano pepper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/08/06/health/06recipehealth_600/06recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "Four servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, bread, tomato, dairy-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 45}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 117, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "612 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds ripe red tomatoes, peeled", "4 ounces stale French baguette, crusts removed and diced or torn into pieces (about 2 1/2 cups diced or torn up bread)", "2 garlic cloves, halved, green shoots removed, coarsely chopped", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (more to taste), plus additional for drizzling", "1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar (to taste)", "Salt to taste", "For garnish: diced green pepper or, for a spicy twist, diced poblano pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the bread in a bowl, and cover with cold water.
