{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Butter Glazed Radishes", "description": "Many people think of radishes as a raw salad topper, but cooked radishes are sweet and crisp-tender and make a quick and easy weeknight side. Brown butter adds a hint of nuttiness, and a touch of sugar caramelizes the radishes, while chopped fresh herbs and a squeeze of lemon lend brightness. Serve the glazed radishes warm or at room temperature. If you find radishes with beautiful green tops, toss the glazed radishes with the greens and a little olive oil for an out-of-the-ordinary salad.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
