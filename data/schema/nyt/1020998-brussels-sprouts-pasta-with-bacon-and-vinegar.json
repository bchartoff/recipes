{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brussels Sprouts Pasta With Bacon and Vinegar", "description": "This recipe is endlessly adaptable: You can use pancetta or even sliced salami in place of the bacon, and chopped cabbage or torn escarole work well if you don't have sprouts. No shallots? A small red onion will do. Keep in mind different types of bacon (or other cured pork) will render different amounts of fat. When you add the brussels sprouts, if the skillet starts to look a little dry, add a tablespoon of oil to keep things moving. To achieve a nice mix of crisp leaves and tender cores, tear off some of the loose outer leaves from your brussels sprouts; they will wilt and blister while the more tightly bundled cores will soften and steam. This recipe is designed for a half pound of pasta; though you may be tempted to add extra pasta, the dish will be plenty filling with a whole pound of brussels sprouts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/31/dining/15Pasta-Brussel-Sporuts-a/merlin_171317142_1b6799eb-3a35-4a87-a8cb-f195e942ade7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, pastas, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "bacon, brussels sprouts, cider vinegar, mustard, parmesan, pasta, shallot", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 919}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 thin slices of bacon", "8 ounces cavatappi or other short pasta", "1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed, halved and outer leaves separated", "2 shallots, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon olive oil (optional)", "1/4 cup cider vinegar or red wine vinegar\u00a0", "2 tablespoons whole-grain or Dijon mustard", "Shaved Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
