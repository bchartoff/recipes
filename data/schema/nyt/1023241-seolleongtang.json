{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seolleongtang", "description": "Seolleongtang (SULL-lung-tahng), also known as ox bone soup, is a deeply comforting dish seemingly magicked out of just bones, sometimes a small hunk of meat, and scallions, if you have them. This version is especially pared down, relying mostly on the bones, which are boiled over multiple hours to imbue the broth with fatty redolence. The best seolleongtang is made from reused bones kept specifically for this dish, which is why batches made with fresh bones may not have the quintessential milky whiteness characteristic to this dish. The broth is seasoned with a quick, gremolata-like mix of scallion, garlic and sea salt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/15ESSENTIALSrex3/merlin_207573363_39b16aeb-a93f-429e-891a-54bcef56b998-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "meat, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "brisket, kimchi, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 4 pounds beef leg bones (see Tip)", "1 pound brisket or chuck roast", "8 scallions, thinly sliced", "8 garlic cloves, finely grated", "4 teaspoons flaky sea salt, plus more as desired", "Steamed white rice, for serving", "Very ripe radish kimchi, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the beef bones and brisket in a very large stockpot (the biggest you have), and add enough cold tap water to fully cover by 1 inch.

At this point, you can refrigerate the soup overnight to remove the fat, which will harden on top once chilled and be easy to remove (don\u2019t forget to refrigerate the brisket, too), or you can pour it back into a clean pot and, just before serving, bring to a simmer over medium heat, skimming the fat off the top with a ladle.
