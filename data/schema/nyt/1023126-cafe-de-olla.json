{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caf\u00e9 de Olla", "description": "Made in batches and served hot, sweet and scented with cinnamon and other spices, Caf\u00e9 de Olla is traditionally brewed in an olla de barro, a tall clay pot. When making Caf\u00e9 de Olla, choose quality, dark roast coffee and, if possible, grind it fresh. Second, seek out piloncillo \u2014 unprocessed, unrefined cane sugar named after the shape of the mold that is traditionally used to make it \u2014 for a richer, deeper, more caramelized flavor. If you don\u2019t have access to piloncillo, use dark brown sugar and add a half to a full teaspoon of molasses. Lastly, take care to never allow the liquid to come to a boil, which can burn the coffee and make the final drink acidic. Serve as is, or set a bottle of tequila, rum, whiskey, cognac or amaro on the table and let drinkers add their chosen spirit to taste. If you have extra Caf\u00e9 de Olla, store it in a covered container in the refrigerator and reheat or serve iced.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/dining/15Brunchrex2/merlin_205050600_39f6edb8-6ac7-4349-82c9-63a3df08ca0b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "brunch, cocktails", "keywords": "cinnamon, coffee, piloncillo", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 256}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces piloncillo (or use a scant 1/2 cup dark brown sugar plus 1/2 teaspoon molasses)", "2 small cinnamon sticks, preferably Mexican cinnamon", "2 whole cloves", "1 star anise (optional)", "1/2 cup freshly ground (medium-grind) dark roast coffee", "2 (3-inch-long) orange peels (optional)", "Spirit of your choice (rum, bourbon or rye whiskeys, cognac or amaro), optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small olla de barro or medium pot, add the piloncillo, 6 cups water, cinnamon sticks, cloves and star anise, if using.
