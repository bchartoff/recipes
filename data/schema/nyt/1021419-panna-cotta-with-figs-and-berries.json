{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Panna Cotta With Figs and Berries", "description": "The classic Italian panna cotta \u2014 cooked cream \u2014 is a pure white custard set with gelatin instead of eggs or starch. It can be prepared up to 2 days in advance, in individual ramekins or a larger mold. In season, it is lovely served with a compote of figs and berries. At other times of year, use other fruits or a simple fruit coulis. Alternatively, a caramel sauce or a bittersweet chocolate sauce drizzled over the panna cotta can be quite nice. Wait until just before serving to unmold.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/16/dining/11Tanisrex4-panna/11Tanisrex4-panna-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "blackberries, blueberries, figs, gelatin, half and half, lemon, raspberries, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 404}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/475 milliliters half-and-half", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "2 wide strips lemon peel (from 1 lemon)", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "2 1/4 teaspoons powdered gelatin (1 package)", "1 cup/145 grams blueberries", "1 cup/140 grams blackberries", "1/2 cup/60 grams raspberries", "12 ripe figs, halved", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters kirsch or Calvados, or use water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, heat the half-and-half over medium-low until it just begins to simmer.
