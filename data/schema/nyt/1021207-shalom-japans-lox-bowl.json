{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shalom Japan\u2019s Lox Bowl", "description": "The lox bowl at Shalom Japan, a Brooklyn restaurant created by chef-owners Sawako Okochi and Aaron Israel, shows how the combination of ingredients can tell a story. Lox, a Jewish-American staple, is set over a bed of sushi rice, inspired by Japanese chirashi bowls, in a meal that marries the cultures of both chefs. The dish combines lox, avocado and spicy mayo with crunchy cucumber, tangy pickles, sweetened kombu and fresh herbs, in a pile of salty, sweet and acidic umami. It takes some prep and quite a few ingredients, but you can pick and choose toppings to taste: \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many rules, other than doing fish over rice,\u201d Mr. Israel said. They cure their own salmon with parsley and dill, coriander and bonito flakes at Shalom Japan, but you can top your rice with store-bought gravlax, or even cooked salmon, tuna or scallops, before piling on your desired garnishes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/26/dining/aw-lox-bowl/aw-lox-bowl-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese, jewish", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, grains and rice, seafood, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, lox, mirin, pickles, rice, salmon, seaweed, short grain rice, sriracha, dairy-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 281}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup rice wine vinegar", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 (1-inch) square dried kombu (optional)", "1 large piece dried kombu (about 4-by-8 inches/20 grams)", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup mirin", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "1/3 cup mayonnaise, preferably Kewpie brand", "1 teaspoon Sriracha", "1/2 teaspoon rice wine vinegar", "2 cups Japanese short-grain rice (about 14 ounces)", "8 to 12 ounces store-bought lox", "1 avocado, halved, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 small Japanese or Persian cucumber, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "1/4 cup assorted Japanese pickles (optional)", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "1 packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems", "3 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced on the bias", "Ikura (salmon roe), optional", "1/4 cup kizami nori (or sushi nori, cut into thin strips)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the sushi zu: Combine the vinegar, sugar, salt and kombu (if using) in a pint-size plastic container.
