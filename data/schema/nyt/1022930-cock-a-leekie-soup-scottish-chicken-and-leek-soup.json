{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cock-a-Leekie Soup (Scottish Chicken and Leek Soup)", "description": "Leeks star in this classic Scottish chicken soup, adding their sweet, oniony flavor to the meaty, fragrant broth. Some versions of this recipe omit the prunes, but their rich fruitiness is what sets this dish apart from other chicken soups. Rice, either brown or white, can stand in for the barley, and some recipes call for oats (in which case use an equal amount of steel-cut, rather than rolled). For a heartier, more stewlike soup, use 3/4 cup barley.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/02/dining/28Apperex/merlin_200566110_37bb0118-666e-43cb-b5c5-852e6cb2a487-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course", "keywords": "chicken drumsticks, chicken soup, chicken thigh, leek, prune", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 734}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and drumsticks", "3 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed", "4 large leeks, cleaned, greens and whites separated", "3 medium carrots, peeled (reserve peels), cut into 1/4-inch-thick coins", "2 celery stalks, thinly sliced (reserve any leaves)", "1 head garlic, halved crosswise", "1 bunch parsley, stems and leaves separated", "3 to 5 fresh thyme sprigs", "1 fresh or dried bay leaf", "1 star anise or clove", "1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup pearl barley", "1/2 cup chopped pitted prunes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.
