{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Cheese With Apples and Apple Butter", "description": "If Cheddar on a slice of apple pie sounds good to you, you will love this twist on a grilled cheese sandwich, which marries salty and sweet elements between two caramelized pieces of buttery bread. Look for dark apple butter, with no added sugar, since it will have the richest flavor. Unlike most grilled cheese recipes, which call for building the sandwiches, cooking them on one side, then flipping, this one calls for cooking the sandwiches open-faced, then assembling them.The cheese melts more quickly and reliably if cooked this way. Depending on the size of your bread slices and your skillet, you may be able to cook two sandwiches at a time. You could also have two pans going, or just serve them as they are finished. To serve all four at once, just transfer the cooked sandwiches to a baking sheet in a 200-degree oven while you crisp up the remaining sandwiches on the stovetop.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/dining/ss-apple-grilled-cheese/ss-apple-grilled-cheese-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, sandwiches", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, apple juice, bread, cheddar, rosemary, shallot, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 298}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed", "1 large Granny Smith apple, cored and thinly sliced", "1 small shallot, halved and thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup apple butter", "8 slices country bread, cut 1/2-inch thick", "4 ounces sharp Cheddar, sliced 1/4-inch thick"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large, 12-inch skillet over medium-high.
