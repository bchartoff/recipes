Ichaporia King, a culinary scholar, anthropologist and terrific home cook, recommends steaming the fish, but the soft lap of wood smoke is a natural complement to the sweet, floral flavor the banana leaf imparts. Look for fresh or frozen banana leaves and coconut at Mexican, Asian and Indian markets. As Ichaporia King says, \u201cIt does represent some effort to find the banana leaves, but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d If you can\u2019t find banana leaves, you can use fig leaves (shiny side-up) or pieces of aluminum foil lined with parchment paper. And if you don\u2019t have access to a grill, you can roast the fish parcels on a baking sheet in an oven preheated to 450 degrees for about 8 minutes until done.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/30/magazine/30eat1/30mag-30eat.t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "banana leaf, fish, mint, serrano pepper", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 313, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "578 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups (185 grams) finely grated coconut (fresh or frozen and thawed)", "2-4 serrano peppers, stemmed and cut into \u00bd-inch pieces", "1 1/2 packed cups roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems (from about 1 large bunch)", "20 mint leaves", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 tablespoons sugar", "Kosher salt", "1/3-1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (from 3\u20134 limes)", "1/2 pound banana leaves (fresh or frozen and thawed)", "2 pounds flaky white fish, like rock cod, lingcod, snapper or sea bass"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using a charcoal grill, fill a chimney starter with charcoal, and light."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place coconut, peppers, cilantro, mint, cumin, sugar, 3/4 teaspoon of salt and about half the lime juice in the bowl of a food processor, and process until very finely chopped, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
