It does not take much more than those eminently compatible ingredients to recognize summer. You hardly need a recipe to prepare steamed or broiled lobsters and serve them with corn on the cob. But you do need more than pocket change. Here, you can satisfy four at lunch or six with a first course at dinner, relying on a single, modest lobster.
