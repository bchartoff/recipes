{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggnog", "description": "Homemade eggnog is simple, a recipe for novices, as long as they can whisk. Where many eggnogs go wrong is that they rely more on cream than on alcohol. It\u2019s not a liquid dessert. It\u2019s a drink, whose coarse edges are muted with cream and eggs. \u201cThe Joy of Cooking\u201d has a recipe that hits all the right points, some of them in excess. Made as is, the drinker is apt to experience a brief moment of jolly followed by blacking out. If this is desirable, turn to the book. If not, turn to my adaptation. I cut some of the cream with milk and cut back on the alcohol just a touch so one could finish a glass while still holding onto it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/09/dining/09COOKING-EGGNOG1/09COOKING-EGGNOG1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails, punches", "keywords": "bourbon, cream, egg yolks, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 193}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 372, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "84 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 fresh egg yolks", "1 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 cups good quality bourbon", "1 cup cream", "1 1/2 cups milk", "6 fresh egg whites", "Pinch sea salt", "1 nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In an electric mixer or by hand, whisk together egg yolks and 3/4 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar until light, dense, and mixture forms a ribbon trail when whisk is lifted.
