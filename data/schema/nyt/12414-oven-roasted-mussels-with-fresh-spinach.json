{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oven-Roasted Mussels With Fresh Spinach", "description": "Mussels don\u2019t have to be steamed. They will pop open in a hot, dry cast iron skillet on a grill or in the oven. In this dish they are first tossed with garlic, olive oil and wine, then roasted along with the marinade in a pan in a hot oven. You may have to do this in batches, depending on the size of your skillet or baking dish. I like to use cast iron or enameled cast iron. This particular recipe is inspired by one in \"The Mozza Cookbook,\" by Nancy Silverton. Served over a generous bed of steamed spinach, this is a beautiful dish. If you have leftovers, remove the mussels from the shells, chop the spinach and toss with pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/05/02/health/nutrition/02recipehealth/02recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, nut-free, main course, mussels, spinach, tomato, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 21}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 491, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1650 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 pounds black mussels", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 to 4 garlic cloves (to taste), minced", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1 pound roma tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1/4 cup minced flat-leaf parsley", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 generous bunches fresh spinach (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds), stem ends trimmed away, washed well in 2 rinses of water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
