The recipe has been designed to make ahead, and will taste as good 2 days after baking as it does on the same day. (It will keep for 4 to 5 days.) To store it, wrap it well, stick it in the fridge and then bring to room temperature before serving. Whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, spiked with a little bourbon if you like, is nice on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/27/dining/27COOKING-CRANGINGERBREAD1/27COOKING-CRANGINGERBREAD1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes, cookies and bars", "keywords": "cranberry, ginger, maple syrup, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1726}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 379, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "198 milligrams", "sugarContent": "51 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/8 ounces/266 grams fresh or frozen cranberries", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 stick/4 ounces/113 grams unsalted butter", "2/3 cup/133 grams dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters maple syrup", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters molasses", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon/5 grams ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon/1 gram ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon/1 gram baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 tablespoon/14 grams grated fresh ginger (from 1-inch piece)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and line a 9-inch square or round baking pan with parchment."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, stir together cranberries, granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon water.
