In this recipe, stripped down to tropical-climate easiness, the ribs are grilled after being sprinkled generously with salt and pepper, not marinated or spice-rubbed. The infusing of the flavors \u2014 fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, jalape\u00f1os, ginger, garlic and lemon grass \u2014 comes after the cooking is done. It\u2019s pretty neat how good that tastes. The recipe makes three or four entr\u00e9e servings, but it also makes a good appetizer for six to eight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby And Chris Schlesinger"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/05thairibs/05thairibs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 entr\u00e9e servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fish sauce, lime juice, ribs, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 122}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1245, "unsaturatedFatContent": "51 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "88 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "105 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "sodiumContent": "2756 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 racks of baby back ribs, about three to three and a half pounds total", "Salt and freshly cracked pepper", "1/4 cup fish sauce", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from about 2 limes)", "1 tablespoon sugar", "2 tablespoons minced jalape\u00f1os or other fresh chilies of your choice", "2 tablespoons minced ginger", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh lemon grass"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a fire in your grill; when the coals are all covered with gray ash and the temperature is medium-low (you can hold your hand 5 inches above the coals for 7 seconds), you\u2019re ready to cook.
