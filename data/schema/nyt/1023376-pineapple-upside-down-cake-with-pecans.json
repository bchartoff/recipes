{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pineapple Upside-Down Cake With Pecans", "description": "By substituting pecans (or other nuts) for the usual maraschino cherries, this twist on a classic upside-down cake is less sweet and crunchier than the usual recipe. Caramelizing the brown sugar in a skillet before adding the fruit gives you a particularly deep, complex flavor. Because of the moisture in the topping, you\u2019ll need to bake this cake a little longer than other, similar butter cakes. Underbaked cake will be soggy and apt to fall apart, but an ideal result will have a well-browned surface and dark, slightly crunchy edges.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/03/dining/28apperex4/merlin_210401394_e2d210f2-905b-41b2-8148-a2dc19433aeb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 (10-inch) cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "pecans, pineapple", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 100}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/56 grams unsalted butter", "1/3 cup/71 grams light brown sugar", "1 1/2 to 2 1/2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (see Tip)", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 pound peeled pineapple, cut into 1/2-inch slices (3 cups; see Tip)", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans", "1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for greasing", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters sour cream or plain whole-milk yogurt", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/2 cups/195 grams all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the topping: In an oven-safe 10-inch skillet, melt butter over medium heat.
