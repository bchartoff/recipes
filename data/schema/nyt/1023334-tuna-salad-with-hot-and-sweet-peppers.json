{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tuna Salad With Hot and Sweet Peppers", "description": "Inspired by the oil-and-vinegar tuna salads of the Mediterranean, this version includes new-world peppers. Letting thin slices of hot and sweet peppers sit with vinegar and salt for a few minutes gives them a pickled taste without taking away their crispness. It also makes for a sharp dressing when mixed with the olive oil from oil-packed tuna. Celery and parsley bring freshness to this blend, which is wonderful on its own and versatile enough to be spooned over toast or tossed with lettuce or pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/GK-Tuna-Pepper-Salad-15SALADREX/GK-Tuna-Pepper-Salad-15SALADREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, weeknight, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "bell pepper, canned tuna, celery, serrano pepper, tuna salad", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 364}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 red, orange or yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced", "1 hot green chile, such as serrano, seeded if desired, thinly sliced", "1 1/2 tablespoons sherry or red wine vinegar", "Salt and black pepper", "2 celery stalks", "2 (5-ounce) cans or 1 (7- to 8-ounce) jar tuna packed in olive oil", "1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss the pepper and the chile with the vinegar and a big pinch of salt in a large bowl.
