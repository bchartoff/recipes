{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Tenderloin Stuffed With Herbs and Capers", "description": "Pork tenderloin is a lean cut that can easily dry out. But stuffing it with herbs, shallots and capers helps keep it nice and juicy as it roasts in a hot oven, and tying up the meat so it\u2019s the same thickness all over helps it cook evenly. After the pork is roasted, the drippings are simmered with orange juice, garlic and a little wine to make a quick, gently sweet pan sauce that goes wonderfully well with the meat. Serve with polenta, crusty bread or rice to soak up the sauce.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/18/dining/19app-1/19app-1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, roasts", "keywords": "capers, orange juice, pork tenderloin, rosemary, sage, shallot, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 516}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 433, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "730 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 pounds pork tenderloin", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 shallots, minced", "2 1/2 tablespoons minced capers, plus a splash of their liquid", "2 1/2 teaspoons chopped sage", "1 1/2 teaspoons chopped rosemary", "1 1/2 teaspoons chopped thyme, more for serving", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1 tablespoon dry white wine or vermouth (or use more stock)", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice", "1/4 cup pork, chicken or other meat stock", "1 to 2 tablespoons butter", "Squeeze of fresh lemon juice (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
