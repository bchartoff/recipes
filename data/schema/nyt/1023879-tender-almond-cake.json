Everyone adores it. Since it has some similarity to other Italian almond cakes, I naturally assumed it to be his family\u2019s, passed down from his Sicilian grandmother. But it turned out to have no Italian storyline. Sal adapted it from a recipe for torta de Santiago, the traditional almond cake from Galicia, Spain, using less sugar, more orange zest and no cinnamon. It\u2019s heavenly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/01/multimedia/25tanisrex3-cake-jtpw/25tanisrex3-cake-jtpw-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "almond, almond extract, lemon zest, orange zest", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened, for greasing the pan", "8 ounces/227 grams blanched almonds", "6 large eggs, separated", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "1 orange, zested", "1 lemon, zested", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
