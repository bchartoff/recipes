{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herby Tomato Salad With Tamarind-Maple Dressing", "description": "Collect the juiciest, ripest tomatoes you can find for this salad (the sweeter and fruitier, the better), which is amplified by an herby, piquant dressing. Start with cilantro, scallions, and Thai basil; perilla leaves lend a grassy, aniseed note. You can find them at Asian grocery stores or greenmarkets, but, if they\u2019re unavailable, substitute shiso or mint. Tamarind is very sour, too tart to enjoy on its own, but paired with a sweetener, such as maple syrup, honey or brown sugar, it sings with citrusy, smokey notes. Don\u2019t be afraid to add more maple, chile, salt or vinegar until you strike that harmonious sweet-sour balance. And, two final notes: If you\u2019re looking for a heartier salad, add 2 cups of cooked grains, like farro or quinoa, and feel free to use store-bought crispy fried shallots if tight on time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/06/dining/hm-tomato-salad/merlin_175613094_4e606174-1e36-444d-8203-c765befbdff5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weekday, salads and dressings, main course", "keywords": "basil, cilantro, perilla, tamarind, tomatoes, summer, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 377}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds mixed tomatoes, such as cherry, heirloom, Sungold or beefsteak", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves picked and stalks finely chopped", "1 packed cup fresh basil leaves, preferably Thai", "12 perilla, shiso or mint leaves, finely chopped", "2 scallions, finely sliced", "3/4 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable", "4 shallots, sliced into 1/16-inch-thick rounds", "Sea salt", "4 tablespoons tamarind concentrate", "2 tablespoons maple syrup", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, grated", "1 garlic clove, grated", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start the salad: Cut the tomatoes into different shapes \u2014 this creates different textures and visual interest \u2014 and place them in a colander.
