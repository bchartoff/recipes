{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Shrimp Cakes With Chile-Lime Mayo", "description": "Savory fried shrimp cakes are popular in coastal areas in many parts of the world, with each region adding its own vibrant flavors to the mix. Here, the golden-edged patties are shot through with fresh basil and cilantro for brightness, chiles for heat and a little fish sauce (an ingredient often found in Southeast Asian recipes) for depth. Then, as an untraditional binder, crushed-up rice cakes are mixed in with the shrimp for an ethereal, especially crisp result. But panko or cracker crumbs make acceptable substitutes if rice cakes aren\u2019t available.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/01/dining/24Apperex/merlin_196810995_3a55e101-b547-478d-8c40-35b77bebf5bb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, rice cakes, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 581}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 5 large original or lightly salted rice cakes, or 6 to 10 thin cakes (see Tip)", "1 pound shelled large raw shrimp (20 to 24), coarsely chopped", "1/4 cup minced shallot (or use onion or scallion)", "6 tablespoons chopped cilantro", "6 tablespoons chopped basil leaves, more for serving", "3 tablespoons minced jalape\u00f1o or red chile pepper", "2 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup\u00a0mayonnaise", "1 lime", "Safflower, peanut or grapeseed oil, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of the food processor (or you can use a blender), add the rice cakes and pulse until you get 1 1/4 cups rice cake crumbs.
