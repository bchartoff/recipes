If you\u2019re feeling slightly more ambitious, then make a topping that adds texture, vibrant green color and more lemony flavor to the dish (see Tip). But don\u2019t cut corners when it comes to the yogurt: Use a thick, strained whole-milk yogurt like labneh, Greek or skyr, as it will give the finished dish an irresistibly rich and tangy taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/15/dining/yf-Creamy-Lemony-Pasta/merlin_201335271_06b1cd5e-3c0a-4ad7-a5b6-175638b8a328-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "labneh, lemon, pasta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1738}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 pound short curly pasta, such as cavatappi, fusilli or farfalle", "1 large lemon, zested and juiced (about 1 tablespoon zest and 3 tablespoons juice)", "A heaping \u00be cup grated Parmesan, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup labneh or other thick, strained whole-milk yogurt, such as Greek or skyr, drained if necessary", "2 scallions, green and white parts, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
