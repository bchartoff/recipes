The dish is quick and simple, ideal for breakfast or a hearty snack between meals, and can be customized with a variety of cheeses and toppings. To make this updated Eggs Kejriwal, toast good bread and smear it with mustard, then pile on some grated cheese mixed up with chopped up green chiles, red onion and cilantro leaves. Once the cheese is bubbling under the broiler, just slide on a fried egg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09eat1/09eat1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, weekday, weeknight", "keywords": "bread, cheddar, egg, onion, serrano chili, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 603}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 428, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "631 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon softened butter", "2 thick slices Pullman bread", "2 teaspoons mustard", "4 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated", "1 serrano chile, finely sliced", "2 tablespoons cilantro leaves, washed and chopped", "1 tablespoon minced red onion", "2 eggs", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "Ketchup (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butter the bread on both sides, and lightly brown in a frying pan (use the pan you like most for frying eggs).
