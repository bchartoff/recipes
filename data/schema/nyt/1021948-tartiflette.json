{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tartiflette", "description": "This Alpine potato and bacon casserole bakes up golden and gloriously gooey thanks to the slices of soft, pungent rind cheese nestled on top. More traditional recipes call for boiling the potatoes separately in one pot, browning the onion and bacon in a skillet, and then combining everything into a casserole dish for baking. This streamlined version accomplishes it all in one large saut\u00e9 pan. Serve this with a leafy salad of peppery, bitter greens to cut the richness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/03/dining/26Apperex1/26Apperex1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, main course", "keywords": "bacon, brie, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, onion, potato, white wine, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 895}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces thick-cut bacon, diced", "2 medium yellow onions, diced (about 2 1/2 cups)", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves", "Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg", "2 pounds Yukon gold or other waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes (about 5 1/2 cups)", "3/4 cup dry white wine", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 to 10 ounces soft cow\u2019s milk cheese with a bloomy rind, such as Reblochon, Camembert or Brie", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
