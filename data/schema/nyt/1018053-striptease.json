It draws its ingredients equally from France and Mexico. The fiery mezcal is calmed by the subtly sweet and fruity blanc vermouth. The guanabana nectar (also known as soursop), which has litchi-like characteristics, adds yet another unexpected flavor note to this twist on a margarita. The drink is a perfectly balanced amalgam of the unusual and the familiar. Goya makes a guanabana nectar that can be found in many New York City bodegas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/13/dining/13VERMOUTH/13VERMOUTH-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "absinthe, agave nectar, guanabana nectar, mezcal, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 28}, "recipeIngredient": ["Absinthe", "Salt", "1 ounce mezcal, preferably Vida", "3/4 ounce blanc vermouth, preferably Dolin", "3/4 ounce lime juice", "1/2 ounce guanabana nectar", "Scant 1/2 ounce agave nectar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dip half of the rim of a rocks glass in absinthe and then in salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a cocktail shaker three-quarters filled with ice, combine the mezcal, vermouth, lime juice, guanabana nectar and agave nectar.
