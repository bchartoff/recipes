{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Endive Salad With Egg and Anchovy", "description": "For a cool-weather salad, pale green Belgian endive dressed with an assertive anchovy vinaigrette is a refreshing beginning to a meal \u2014 or a nice light lunch. For more color, try adding other endive relatives: the red-leafed variety, fris\u00e9e, different types of radicchio or speckled Castelfranco chicory. All of these winter salad greens have sweetness and a pleasant hint of bitterness. Belgian endive is the mildest of the bunch. As for anchovies, look for good fat meaty ones. Rinse and blot, then coat with a little good extra-virgin olive oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/05/dining/03Tanisrex-salad/merlin_167974515_1fb1fa58-3ad0-42e3-9b84-1878cd30b449-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "anchovy, endive, lemon, radicchio, main course, side dish, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 garlic cloves", "10 to 12 anchovy fillets, rinsed and blotted", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "Salt and pepper", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "6 to 8 large Belgian endives", "A few handfuls of radicchio leaves or other brightly colored chicories (optional)", "6 to 8 large medium-boiled eggs, cooled and peeled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the vinaigrette: Pound together (or hand chop) garlic and 4 anchovy fillets to make a rough paste.
