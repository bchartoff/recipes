The British chef Fergus Henderson calls it that \u2013 an unctuous and shockingly delicious jellied broth made from pigs\u2019 feet, vegetables and Madeira that imparts an intensely flavorful, lip-sticking quality to any stew or soup to which it is added. He gave The Times the recipe in 2009. It is project cooking at its most exciting and slightly ridiculous \u2013 a four- or five-hour process that yields 6 or so cups of glory to punch up any recipe for beans that you have on hand, elevate a beef-and-Guinness pie to extraordinary heights, make fantastic an otherwise benign casserole of baked chicken thighs. Friends and family will ask: What\u2019s the secret ingredient? Say nothing until well after all the plates are cleared.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/05/dining/ss-trotter-gear/merlin_150673191_7722d1b3-2c97-4805-808b-00ca9e209c5a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "Makes about 6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, pigs feet, red wine, vegetables, side dish, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 165}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 trotters (pigs\u2019 feet)", "2 red onions, halved", "2 ribs celery, chopped", "2 carrots, peeled and chopped", "2 leeks, cleaned and chopped", "1 head garlic", "2 bay leaves", "12 black peppercorns", "2 sprigs thyme", "1 cup Madeira or other sweet wine, or one bottle red wine", "About 1 quart chicken stock"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place everything but the liquids in a large pot.
