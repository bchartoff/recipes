{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Hazelnut Crepe Cake", "description": "Something magical happens when you layer crepes with cream to build a cake. The flavors intensify, you improve the cream to crepe ratio and there are more crispy edges. And then there is the dazzling moment when you present the ethereal cake and slice into it to reveal a whole world of fine rings. This cake, with light hazelnut crepes and rich chocolate cream, isn't difficult to make (though the first crepe in the pan is always a flop; don't get discouraged). It does take some time, though, to make and assemble. Just keep the image of the gorgeous final product in your mind as you work.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/05/dining/05CREPE1-WEB/05CREPE1-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "chocolate, cocoa powder, hazelnut meal, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 260}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 581, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "208 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks", "2 cups/473 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters heavy cream", "1 cup/145 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/90 grams hazelnut meal", "1/4 cup/50 grams sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more butter for greasing pan", "6 ounces/170 grams high-quality chocolate, 64 percent cocoa, finely chopped", "1/3 cup/67 grams sugar", "1/3 cup/40 grams cornstarch", "1/4 cup/25 grams good quality cocoa powder", "Pinch kosher salt", "2 1/2 cups/591 milliliters whole milk", "6 large egg yolks", "2 tablespoons/29 grams unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons/45 milliliters brandy or strong coffee", "1 cup/236 milliliters heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks", "3 tablespoons/27 grams chopped, toasted hazelnuts", "Cocoa powder, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crepe batter: Whisk together eggs, egg yolks, milk and cream in a medium bowl.
