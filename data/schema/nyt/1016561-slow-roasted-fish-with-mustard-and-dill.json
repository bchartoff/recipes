{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Roasted Fish With Mustard and Dill", "description": "What if, instead of my usual hot-roasting method, I wrapped a whole fish tightly in parchment and put it in a slow oven? It was a technique I had never seen in a cookbook, and when I described it to Eric Ripert, the chef and an owner of Le Bernardin, he said it was new to him. The experiment worked beautifully. A week later, to serve with Portuguese white wines, I had the opportunity for an encore. This time it was a two-pound porgy, and again, after exactly an hour, the bone lifted easily from the perfectly cooked, moist and silken flesh. Lemon, ginger, mustard and herbs brought it into harmony with the wines.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/11/dining/11PAIR1/11PAIR1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, roasts", "keywords": "dill, fish, mustard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 133}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 678, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "93 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1434 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "1 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped", "2 tablespoons minced fresh dill", "3/4 teaspoon brown mustard seeds", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1 2-pound porgy, black sea bass, ocean perch or similar fish, gutted and scaled", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 shallot, chopped", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 200 degrees.
