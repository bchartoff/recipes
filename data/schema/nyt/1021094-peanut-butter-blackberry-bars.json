They\u2019re super fast to make with an electric mixer, but you can also make the dough by hand: Just be sure the butter is very soft before you start, and mix with a sturdy wooden spoon or rubber spatula. To make easy work of pressing the dough into the baking dish, use lightly floured hands or the bottom of a flat measuring cup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/dining/18fruitrex3-bars/merlin_172489962_fcf16779-37cf-4807-814f-f20400990dd7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "16 bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "butter, frozen fruit, peanut butter, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, mother\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 652}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 cup/255 grams natural or processed peanut butter or almond butter", "1/2 cup/110 grams packed light or dark brown sugar", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1 (10-ounce/285-gram) bag frozen blackberries, raspberries, blueberries or a combination", "Flaky salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
