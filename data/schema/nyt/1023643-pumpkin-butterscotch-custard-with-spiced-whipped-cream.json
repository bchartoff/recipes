To make this dish supremely festive, it\u2019s baked in one large dish instead of individual custard cups. And because it needs to be prepared almost entirely in advance, it\u2019s a perfect dinner party dessert. Serve it scooped into bowls, with some crisp cookies on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/08appe-not-pie1-custard/merlin_214747473_8563f6f1-e0f1-4c6f-a509-62bfc541fedc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "dark brown sugar, egg yolks, heavy cream, make-ahead, party, plan-ahead, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, pumpkin spice, fall, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 377}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/210 grams packed dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon/14 grams unsalted butter", "1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters heavy cream", "1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters whole milk", "5 large eggs", "4 large egg yolks", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1 cup/250 grams pumpkin pur\u00e9e or solid pack pumpkin", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract or bourbon", "1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice", "2 cups/473 milliliters heavy cream, cold", "1/3 cup/35 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
