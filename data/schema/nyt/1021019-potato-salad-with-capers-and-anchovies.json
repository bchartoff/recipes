{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato Salad With Capers and Anchovies", "description": "Serve this zesty room-temperature salad on its own with crisp lettuce or arugula leaves on the side, or to accompany meats from the grill, a roast chicken or any type of fish. The dressing is essentially a well-seasoned vinaigrette, enhanced with Dijon mustard, capers, a little garlic and a few chopped anchovies. Red onion, thyme leaves and chopped parsley complete the picture \u2014 in all, a very simple dish. Most important is to dress the potato slices very carefully with your hands, in order to coat them well and to keep them from breaking. It is a potato salad you\u2019ll grow to love, best eaten within hours of assembling (but perfectly serviceable the next day).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/dining/08Tanisrex-salad/merlin_172154859_ad8e7f4a-373f-4176-bc3d-4ce483762563-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "anchovies, capers, eggs, potato, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 441}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 pounds medium yellow-fleshed potatoes, like Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn", "1/4 cup finely diced red onion", "3 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "2 garlic cloves, finely minced or grated", "1 tablespoon chopped anchovy (about 4 fillets)", "1 tablespoon small capers (or large capers, roughly chopped)", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon thyme leaves", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley", "3 hard-boiled eggs (8- to 9-minute eggs), for garnish", "A handful of arugula leaves, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
