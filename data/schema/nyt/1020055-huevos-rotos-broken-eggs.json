There\u2019s always a runny egg, but whether it sits atop fried potato rounds, French fries or crunchy chips varies by region and personal preference. The potatoes are often served with chorizo sausage or Serrano ham, but in this vegetarian version, smoked paprika and red-pepper flakes mimic chorizo\u2019s flavor and heat. Pierce the eggs just before serving so the golden yolks coat the potatoes with a glossy sauce. Serve with saut\u00e9ed greens or a crisp salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette. This one-pan meal is good with a cup of coffee or a beer \u2014 it\u2019s breakfast, lunch or dinner material.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/dining/as-huevos-rotos/merlin_150673095_5acc0941-eae4-4dda-b1f5-9ffe846c5fdc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "eggs, potato, smoked paprika, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1290}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 417, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "745 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes or 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 pounds new potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces if necessary", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "4 eggs", "Lemon wedges, for serving", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a measuring cup, combine the olive oil, paprika, red-pepper flakes, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, a generous grind of pepper and 1 cup water.
