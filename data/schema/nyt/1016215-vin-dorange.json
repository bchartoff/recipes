{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vin d'Orange", "description": "Oranges steeped in ros\u00e9 produce a powerfully pretty house wine, with a flavor akin to Lillet or Campari. The most traditional versions from the south of France are made with bitter Seville oranges, the ones used for marmalade. This recipe, from Sally Clarke, a chef in London, is adjusted for the sweetness of American fruit. Your citrus should be organic and clean, because anything on the peel will end up in the wine. The end result is lovely plain or mixed with sparkling wine or water.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/rose/rose-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, cocktails, project", "keywords": "vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 66}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 458, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "13 milligrams", "sugarContent": "48 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 organic tangerines or oranges, with a good balance of tart and sweet", "2 lemons or grapefruits (or one of each)", "1 1/2 cups sugar", "1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise", "", "1 cinnamon stick, about 4 inches long", "2 liters ros\u00e9 (about 2 1/2 bottles)", "1cup of vodka", "1/4 cup dark rum"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice the citrus in thick wheels and place it in a clean container (glass or hard plastic) with a wide mouth and a tight-fitting lid.
