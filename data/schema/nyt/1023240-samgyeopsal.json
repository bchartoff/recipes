A chill way to have Korean barbecue at home, samgyeopsal, or \u201cthree-layer meat,\u201d refers to pork belly\u2019s fat cap and the two leaner layers of meat below it, one light and one dark. Crisp slivers of pork are wrapped in various lettuces and dabbed with doenjang honey and punchy slivers of raw garlic. The lightly peppered, vinegared freshness of pa muchim, an all-occasion scallion salad often served with the grilled meats at Korean barbecue restaurants, is a welcome accompaniment to rich foods like fried or rotisserie-style chickens, pan-seared pork chops, and grilled bulgogi, galbi and samgyeopsal. Don\u2019t skip the sesame oil dipping sauce; its nuttiness lets the pork belly shine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/15ESSENTIALSrex7/15ESSENTIALSrex7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "doenjang, pork belly, rice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 73}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 scallions, trimmed, cut into 3-inch segments, then very thinly sliced lengthwise into matchsticks", "1 tablespoon rice vinegar", "2 teaspoons gochugaru", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "Pinch of granulated sugar", "Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound assorted lettuces, such as Little Gem, endive and perilla, leaves separated", "4 garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons doenjang", "1 tablespoon honey", "Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "2 pounds thinly sliced pork belly, cut into 2-inch strips (see Tip)", "Steamed white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pa muchim: In a medium bowl, toss to combine the scallions, vinegar, gochugaru, sesame oil and sugar.
