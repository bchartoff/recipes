{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Halibut, Chard and Potato Casserole", "description": "This is based on a comforting Majorcan dish that is traditionally made with hake, a fish that isn\u2019t as easy to find here as halibut or Arctic char, both of which I\u2019ve used for the dish. Pacific halibut is the type that gets the Environmental Defense Fund\u2019s highest rating. Make sure to cover this tightly so the fish doesn\u2019t dry out. An hour seems like a long time to cook fish, but the fish is well insulated and won\u2019t dry out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/29/science/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, nut-free, fall, gold potatoes, halibut, swiss chard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 92}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 468, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "982 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 14-ounce can chopped tomatoes, with juice", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "1 generous bunch Swiss chard 1 3/4 to 2 pounds, stemmed and washed", "1 pound Yukon gold potatoes or fingerlings, scrubbed and sliced", "1 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped 1/2 cup chopped", "2 pounds Pacific halibut or Arctic char fillets", "1/2 cup dry white wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
