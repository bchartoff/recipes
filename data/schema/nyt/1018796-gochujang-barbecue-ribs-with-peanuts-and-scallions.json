That is why the chef Joseph Lenn, of J.C. Holdway in Knoxville, Tenn., always quick-cures the ribs with an overnight rub of salt, black pepper and brown sugar. This ensures the meat is seasoned evenly throughout, and is something he recommends for any slow-cooked or braised meat. Mr. Lenn\u2019s mop sauce, a homage to the Dixie Sweet sauce at Martin\u2019s Bar-B-Que Joint in Nashville, is fired up with gochujang, a Korean chile paste. It works equally well on bone-in chicken breasts and wings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jane Black"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/21/dining/21CHEF2/21CHEF2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "barbecue, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, barbecues, meat", "keywords": "gochujang, light brown sugar, peanut, scallion, spareribs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 288}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 racks St. Louis-style spareribs (2 1/2 pounds each)", "1/2 cup kosher salt", "1/2 cup packed light brown sugar", "1/4 cup ground black pepper", "1/2 cup gochujang", "1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar", "1/2 cup packed light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon chile powder, such as ancho", "1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1 cup chopped peanuts", "1 cup sliced scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before you plan to cook the ribs, use a paper towel to help you pull the silver skin off the backside of the ribs.
