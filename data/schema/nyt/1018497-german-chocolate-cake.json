{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "German Chocolate Cake", "description": "German chocolate cake is an American classic, named after a chocolatier called Samuel German (as opposed to the European nation). Milder than devil\u2019s food cake, this chocolate cake has layers that are subtle and sweet, chocolatey but not excessively so. They create a lovely, velvet-textured vehicle for the heaps of gooey, toasted coconut and pecan custard. For more chocolate appeal, rich ganache can be slathered on the sides. This not only adds another blissful layer of chocolate, but also neatens up the look and makes for a party-worthy presentation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/17/dining/17COOKING-GERMAN-CHOC-CAKE2/17COOKING-GERMAN-CHOC-CAKE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "coconut, coffee, pecan, semisweet chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 306}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 sticks/171 grams unsalted butter (12 tablespoons), at room temperature, plus more for the pans", "1 3/4 cups/254 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/50 grams Dutch-process cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "4 ounces/113.5 grams semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled slightly", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters brewed coffee, cooled to room temperature", "1/2 cup/114 grams plain whole milk yogurt or sour cream, at room temperature", "2 cups/7 ounces/198 grams sweetened shredded coconut", "2 cups/227 grams pecan halves", "1 12-ounce can/354 milliliters evaporated milk", "5 large egg yolks, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/150 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters heavy cream", "6 ounces/170 grams semisweet chocolate, chopped", "Pinch kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
