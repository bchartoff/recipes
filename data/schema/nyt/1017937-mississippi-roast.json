{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mississippi Roast", "description": "An Internet darling of a recipe, a favorite of mom bloggers and <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/nytfood/\">Pinterest</a>, Mississippi Roast is traditionally made by placing a chuck roast in a <a href=\"http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-slow-cooker/\">slow cooker</a> and simmering it beneath a stick of butter, a package of ranch dressing mix, another of \u201cau jus\u201d gravy mix and a handful of pepperoncini. And you can certainly cook it that way. The raves are justified. But replacing the packaged mixes is no real chore, and it results in a luscious tangle of deliciously tangy beef that goes beautifully with mashed or roasted potatoes or egg noodles, or as a hot-sandwich filling. Cooking time will vary depending on the size of your roast and the effectiveness of your slow cooker. But six to eight hours generally does the trick.
