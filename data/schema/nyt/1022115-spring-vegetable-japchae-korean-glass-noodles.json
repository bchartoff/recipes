{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Vegetable Japchae (Korean Glass Noodles)", "description": "Japchae is a savory Korean stir-fry with mixed vegetables, beef and sweet potato noodles. Also known as glass noodles, sweet potato noodles can be found in Asian markets; once cooked, the noodles turn translucent, light and chewy. (They are also wheat-free, so they are a great option for those avoiding gluten.) The noodles are cooked first, then sit in the sauce, absorbing all of the  garlicky sesame and soy flavors like a sponge. This springtime japchae celebrates crisp asparagus and snap peas. Japchae can be made a few hours ahead and served at room temperature, making it the perfect dish for potlucks and picnics.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/10/dining/kc-spring-vegetable-japchae/kc-spring-vegetable-japchae-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, noodles, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "asparagus, glass noodles, soy sauce, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1145}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon turbinado sugar (or brown sugar)", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "12 ounces dried sweet potato noodles (glass noodles)", "3 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "1/2 small yellow onion, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)", "4 ounces carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks (about 1 cup)", "4 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 medium yellow bell pepper, cored, seeded and sliced into 1/8-inch-thick strips", "4 ounces sugar snap peas, thinly sliced lengthwise (about 1 1/2 cups)", "6 ounces asparagus, trimmed and thinly sliced on a bias, tips kept whole (about 1 heaping cup)", "4 ounces baby spinach (about 2 packed cups)", "Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, garlic, sugar, sesame oil and 1/2 teaspoon pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot of boiling water, cook noodles until tender and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes.
