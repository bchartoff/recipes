{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Italian Almond Cookies", "description": "These delectable almond cookies are made with just a few ingredients. Though they\u2019re typically Sicilian, similar versions are found all over Italy. A bit like macaroons, they are crisp on the outside, with a perfumed chewy interior. They may be baked plain, decorated with candied fruit or whole almonds, or made into thumbprint cookies, filled with a spoonful of good jam. Ideal to bake in advance, these cookies keep well for several days, ready to serve at a moment\u2019s notice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/03/dining/26Tanisrex3-cookies/26Tanisrex3-cookies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "almond extract, blanched almonds, egg whites", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 698}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/290 grams blanched almonds", "2/3 cup/130 grams granulated sugar", "2 egg whites", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting", "Amarena cherries or whole unblanched almonds, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put half the almonds and half the sugar in the bowl of a food processor.
