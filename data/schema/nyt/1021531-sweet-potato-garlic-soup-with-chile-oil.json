{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato-Garlic Soup With Chile Oil", "description": "This silky-smooth sweet potato soup features the deep flavor of roasted garlic and a splendid dose of garlicky, Sichuan peppercorn chile oil, which delivers heat and a tingling sensation with every spoonful. Roasting the sweet potatoes at a high temperature does a few things in this recipe: First, it develops the sweet potato\u2019s flavors, and second, it softens the tubers, yielding a smooth texture. Serve this soup with thick slices of buttered, toasted bread\u00a0to sop it up.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/09/dining/ns-soup1/ns-soup1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "cumin, garlic, sichuan peppercorns, sweet potato, fall, winter, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 781}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head of garlic", "2 teaspoons plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 3 medium), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 medium yellow onion, peeled and diced", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "3 cups low-sodium vegetable stock", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Fine sea salt", "1/2 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed", "2 tablespoons red-pepper flakes, such as Aleppo", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns, crushed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
