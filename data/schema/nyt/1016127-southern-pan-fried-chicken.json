That\u2019s a lot of unattended prep time before you get around to frying them in a slurry of lard and butter flavored with country ham.

Even better? It\u2019s just as good cold as it is hot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/13/dining/chicken-still-2/chicken-still-2-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 273}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1071, "unsaturatedFatContent": "48 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "89 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "sodiumContent": "1141 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces", "1/4 cup kosher salt", "4 cups buttermilk", "1 pound lard", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup country ham pieces or 1 thick slice country ham cut into 1/2-inch strips", "1 cup flour", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The night before serving: Place chicken in a large bowl and set aside.
