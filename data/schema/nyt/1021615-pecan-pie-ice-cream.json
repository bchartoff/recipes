{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pecan Pie Ice Cream", "description": "This pecan pie ice cream is built on a base of French vanilla, with toasted pecans, cloaked in maple syrup, swirled in. Making the vanilla custard for this French-style ice cream is a delicate operation, like producing hollandaise, because of the fragile nature of eggs when they are heated. Perform this part of the recipe when you can give it your full, undivided attention. If preparing this custard in a saucepan over direct heat makes you nervous about overcooking and curdling the eggs, you can make it in a double boiler, but it will take at least 20 minutes longer to get the custard to thicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/dining/09frozenrex1/merlin_179473332_dbceab80-eb82-49ee-8a31-c129572b6f87-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H30M", "recipeYield": "5 cups (about 8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets, dessert", "keywords": "heavy cream, pecans, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 84}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups whole milk", "1 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup light brown sugar", "2 eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup coarsely chopped pecans", "2/3 cup maple syrup", "2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place milk and cream in a heavy saucepan.
