And at its center is moufleta, a flat cake that you fry in a pan and assemble into a stack. (If that seems too tricky, we provide a method here for making them individually.) The dough is fairly simple, as are the traditional toppings, soft butter and honey. But if you prefer homemade or Nutella, no one but the staunchest traditionalists is likely to complain.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ron Lieber"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/04/dining/04mimounarex2/merlin_135727107_6100cb28-6b5d-4b22-9018-604e138927d9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 20 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "pancakes", "keywords": "dessert, kosher", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 41}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 286, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "95 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 cups/1024 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon instant dry yeast", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup vegetable or canola oil", "Butter and honey, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, yeast and salt.

When the pan is hot, carefully pick up the first moufleta (it will be stretchy and have a hard time holding its shape) and place it on the hot skillet. Cook on one side, about 1 to 2 minutes, until the underside has golden-brown patches. Flip the pancake over, roll out the next ball of dough and place it on top of the first one. When the bottom side has golden-brown patches, flip both pancakes together to cook the new one. Roll out another moufleta and place on top of the moufleta pack in the skillet. Flip to cook. Repeat for all moufletas, starting over again when you have a pack of 7 or 8. Except for the first one, they are all getting cooked only on one side. (Alternatively, the moufletas can be cooked one at a time for about 1 to 2 minutes per side and removed to a plate, each one going underneath the one cooked before it to help keep them from drying out. Cover the plate with a towel as you work.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Serve immediately, while warm, with butter and honey."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019237-moroccan-moufleta"}
