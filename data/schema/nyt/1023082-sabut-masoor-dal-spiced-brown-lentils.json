This recipe cuts that time in half by using high heat throughout the cooking process, removing extra water once the dal is tender and simultaneously cooking the masala. This kind of efficiency does require the use of two utensils, and it means watching a couple of burners at a time. It\u2019s worth the effort because in the end, there\u2019s the warmth of a big bowl of dal in around 30 minutes, a miracle when such comfort is most needed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zainab Shah"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/31/dining/zh-masoor-daal/zh-masoor-daal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 568}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup whole masoor dal, soaked for 10 minutes and drained", "1 bay leaf", "1/4 cup ghee or neutral oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon ginger paste or freshly grated ginger", "1/2 teaspoon garlic paste or freshly grated garlic", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chile powder, or any ground red chile", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "2 medium plum tomatoes, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 fresh Thai green chiles, stemmed and chopped", "2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, from about half a large lemon", "1/2 teaspoon garam masala, for garnish", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish", "Rice or roti, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (about 6-quart) pot, add 7 cups of water, the whole masoor dal and bay leaf.
