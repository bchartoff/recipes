{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Cheesecake", "description": "If there\u2019s one dessert that would least  benefit from innovation, it would have to be New York-style cheesecake. No tricks, no twists; Just a crumbly graham cracker crust and lots of lightly sweetened cream cheese. Baking a cheesecake without a water bath might seem like you're tempting fate, but if you do so at a low enough temperature, it will cook the filling gently and evenly without the risk of curdling or scorching. While cracks on the cheesecake's surface won\u2019t affect the taste, they can be unsightly and are most likely to occur when there\u2019s a sudden temperature change (say, from the oven to the fridge). To reduce the chances of cracking, let the cheesecake rest in the oven a few minutes before transferring to the counter to cool completely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/20/dining/20COOKING-NYCHEESECAKE2/20COOKING-NYCHEESECAKE2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, custards and puddings", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 368}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 721, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "sodiumContent": "499 milligrams", "sugarContent": "36 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["18 whole graham crackers (about 10 ounces/284 grams)", "1/4 cup/55 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)", "3/4 cup/170 grams (1\u00bd sticks) unsalted butter, melted", "2 pounds/904 grams cream cheese (four 8-ounce/226-gram packages), room temperature", "\u00bd cup/113 grams sour cream", "1 cup/201 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "\u00bd teaspoon kosher salt", "4 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk", "\u00bc cup/32 grams all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, combine graham crackers, brown sugar, salt and cinnamon (if using) and process until you\u2019ve got fine crumbs.
