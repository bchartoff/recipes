{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Lamb Shanks With Fresh Herbs\u00a0", "description": "Bone-in lamb shanks are perfect for braising. The marrow in the bones releases into the sauce, deepening its flavor, while the tough meat softens into perfect tenderness during the long, slow cooking. In this recipe (very loosely based on a Georgian stew called chakapuli) the shanks are cooked with a prodigious amount of fresh herbs, adding fragrance and body. You can braise this several days in advance, then reheat it on the stove. The flavors get even better after having a chance to meld. Just don\u2019t add the final herbal garnish until right before serving. A little bread, polenta or rice would be just the thing to soak up the heady sauce, though a spoon works, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/20/dining/20appetite1/merlin_131160217_b567e972-0925-4209-b936-f2ec4221a166-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "chives, lamb shanks, mint, mustard greens, tarragon, white wine, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 172}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 852, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "57 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "64 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "1184 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "5 pounds lamb shanks (5 to 6 shanks)", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed", "1 large sweet onion (white or red), peeled, halved and thinly sliced", "8 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "2 teaspoons coriander seeds, coarsely cracked", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1 1/2 cups dry white wine", "2 bunches scallions, finely chopped (white and green parts)", "2 cups chopped spicy greens such as mustard greens, mizuna, arugula, or radish tops", "1 1/2 cups chopped cilantro (tender stems and leaves only)", "1 cup chopped parsley (tender stems and leaves only)", "1 cup chopped mint or dill or a combination (tender stems and leaves only)", "1/2 cup chopped tarragon (tender stems and leaves only)", "1/2 cup chopped chives", "About 1 cup chicken or lamb stock, or water", "2 to 3 tablespoons dried currants (optional)", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Fresh lemon juice, as needed (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl (or covered container) large enough to hold the lamb, mix together salt, paprika and pepper.
