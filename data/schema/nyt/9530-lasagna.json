She tested several, and finally found her ideal in a mash-up of recipes from Giuliano Bugialli and Elodia Rigante, both Italian cookbook authors. \n\n\u201cIf there were central casting for casseroles, this one deserved the leading role. But its beauty was more than cheese deep. This was the best lasagna I had ever eaten. The sauce was intensely flavored, the cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, the meat was just chunky enough, and the noodles put up no resistance to the fork. Most important, the balance of pasta and sauce was positively Italian. At last I could understand why my neighbor Geoff had told me, as I dragged home more bags in our elevator, that all-day lasagna is the only kind worth making.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Regina Schrambling"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/15/dining/15RECIPE20DIN/15RECIPE20DIN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "ground sirloin, lasagna noodles, pancetta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3891}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1085, "unsaturatedFatContent": "43 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "77 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "50 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "sodiumContent": "1335 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 medium red onions, finely diced", "2 large cloves minced garlic", "8 ounces pancetta, diced", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 cups good red wine, preferably Italian", "2 28-ounce cans Italian plum tomatoes", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "3/4 pound ground sirloin", "1/4 cup freshly grated pecorino Romano", "2 eggs", "10 sprigs fresh parsley, leaves only, washed and dried", "2 large whole cloves garlic", "1/2 cup flour", "1 pound Italian sausage, a mix of hot and sweet", "1 15-ounce container ricotta cheese", "2 extra-large eggs", "2 cups freshly grated pecorino Romano", "1/2 cup chopped parsley", "1 pound mozzarella, grated", "16 sheets fresh lasagna noodles, preferably Antica Pasteria"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the sauce, heat 1/2 cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle over low heat.
