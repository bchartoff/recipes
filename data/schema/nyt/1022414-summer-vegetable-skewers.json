Salting them for 10 or so minutes before grilling helps season them through and through, but you can skip that step if you\u2019re short on time.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a> newsletter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/28/dining/23apperex2/23apperex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "skewers and kebabs, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "eggplant, garlic, oregano, zucchini, summer, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 297}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds zucchini or eggplant, or a combination, cut into 1-inch cubes", "Fine sea salt", "2 fat garlic cloves, finely grated, pressed or minced", "2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano or marjoram", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "Lemon wedges, for serving", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the grill to high.
