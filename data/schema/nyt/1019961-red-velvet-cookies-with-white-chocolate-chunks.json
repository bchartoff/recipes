{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red Velvet Cookies With White Chocolate Chunks", "description": "As easy to make as your favorite chocolate chip recipe, these cookies pack the fun and flavor of red velvet cake into a simple, and much faster, cookie. Super sweet and tender with a slightly fudgy center, they contain creamy white chocolate chunks that nod to the snowy frosting on the cake version. For particularly pristine cookies, reserve some of the white chocolate chunks to arrange on top of the cookie, as they tend to get tinted pink when mixed into the batter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/dining/em-red-velvet-cookies/em-red-velvet-cookies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "cocoa powder, flour, red food coloring, vanilla, white chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 251}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 122, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "69 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons red food coloring, preferably gel", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/195 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons buttermilk or whole milk", "4 ounces/115 grams white chocolate, coarsely chopped into chunks (3/4 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Move racks to the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
