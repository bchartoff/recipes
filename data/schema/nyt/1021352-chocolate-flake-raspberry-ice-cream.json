{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate-Flake Raspberry Ice Cream", "description": "A few years back, I made a delicious discovery: I could get the luxurious texture of French-style, custard-based ice cream with a recipe for eggless, Philadelphia-style ice cream. My ice cream has the usual cream, milk and sugar, but it\u2019s also got powdered milk for richness, honey for smoothness, and alcohol for scoopability. The vodka keeps the ice cream soft and creamy, desirable in any ice cream and vital when there are berries, which have a tendency to go from juicy to rock-hard in the freezer. Any berries will work in this recipe, but I use raspberries, fresh or frozen, and bolster their flavor and color with a little freeze-dried raspberry powder (optional, but nice). The chocolate flakes are made with melted dark chocolate and coconut oil. Drizzled into the ice cream at the end of churning, the chocolate spins into flakes; drizzled over the ice cream before serving, it hardens on contact.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/16/magazine/16mag-eat/16mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 generous quart", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "buttermilk, chocolate, coconut oil, heavy cream, raspberries, vodka, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 612}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces/340 grams semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons coconut oil", "8 ounces/225 grams fresh (or frozen) raspberries (if using frozen, don\u2019t defrost)", "2 cups/480 milliliters heavy cream", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk (shake well before measuring)", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons honey", "3 tablespoons powdered milk", "3 tablespoons vodka", "2 tablespoons freeze-dried raspberry powder (optional)", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chocolate flake and topping: Mix\u00a0together the chocolate and oil in a heatproof bowl fitted over a saucepan of simmering water.
