It\u2019s good both warm and cold, either on its own or topped with berries that have been macerated in a pinch or two of sugar. Make sure to use whole milk Greek yogurt or another thick, strained variety here, or the texture won\u2019t be as creamy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/03/dining/01rodenrex2-cake/01rodenrex2-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "turkish", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "greek yogurt, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2643}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter, for greasing the pan", "4 large eggs, separated, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 2/3 cups/400 grams whole-milk Greek yogurt", "1 lemon, zested and juiced", "Pinch of salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and butter an 8- or 9-inch springform pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using an electric hand mixer or a standing electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites on medium-low until the mixture looks frothy, 1 to 2 minutes.
