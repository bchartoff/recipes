Enjoyed as old-fashioned comfort food throughout the United States, it's often attributed to New England, where any number of other ingredients are scalloped, like potatoes, oysters, clams and tomatoes. Cooks differ over whether to use heavy cream, condensed milk or white sauce, but nearly all agree buttered cracker crumbs or bread crumbs are essential for the topping. If you like, scalloped corn can be prepared several hours ahead of serving and reheated.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/19/dining/19KITCHEN1/19KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, new england", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "bell pepper, corn, crackers, milk, side dish, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 184}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 302, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "362 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick)", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 cups milk or half-and-half", "Salt and pepper", "Pinch of cayenne", "1 small onion, diced (about 1 cup)", "1 small red bell pepper, diced (about 1 cup)", "Kernels from 6 ears fresh corn (about 3 cups)", "1 egg, beaten", "1/2 cup crushed oyster crackers or soda crackers"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees and position a rack in the middle.
