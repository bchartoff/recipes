{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Perfect Boiled Eggs", "description": "If your goal is perfectly smooth, blemish-free boiled eggs that jump out of their shells every single time, I\u2019ve got bad news: No technique in the world can promise that level of perfection. But armed with data from scientific tests done with more than 90 testers and more than 700 boiled eggs, this technique for boiled eggs \u2014 technically steamed, as they cook in just an inch of water \u2014 will maximize your odds. Fresher eggs will take slightly longer to peel, but they should peel just as cleanly as older eggs. The eggs in this recipe should be cooked straight from the refrigerator; reduce cooking times by 1 minute if using room-temperature eggs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
