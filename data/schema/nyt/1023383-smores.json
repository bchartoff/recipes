But there are a few best practices, including tool and setup tips from the camp-cooking experts <a href=\"https://www.freshoffthegrid.com/\">Megan McDuffie, Michael van Vliet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kenapeay?lang=en\">Kena Peay</a> that ensure the marshmallow roasts to gooey, charred excellence and the chocolate surrenders to the heat of the marshmallow, melting but not liquifying. While delicious s\u2019mores can be <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/992-indoor-smores\">achieved indoors</a> with a microwave, broiler, gas stovetop or even a candle with some fight in it, a campfire or fire pit imparts a nostalgic woodsy smokiness. Add-ons like jam, peanut butter, chile flakes or fresh berries are fun to try out.
