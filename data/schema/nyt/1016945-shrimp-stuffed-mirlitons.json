{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp-Stuffed Mirlitons", "description": "The mirliton is a pale green squash with an end puckered up like a toothless granny. They are native to Louisiana, but if you grew up eating from certain Latin American culinary canons, you might know them as chayote. \nIn New Orleans, mirliton stuffed with shrimp is a dish both common and fancy. The chef David Guas, who grew up in Louisiana and now runs the Bayou Bakery in Washington, D.C., ate this version at his Granny Lilly\u2019s holiday table in Amite, La. His recipe is a version of her original, but with a touch of heat from cayenne pepper as influenced by Justin Wilson, a relative who had a long-running cooking show on New Orleans public television that he punctuated with the tagline \u201cI guaranteeeeee!\u201d  \nUse the freshest shrimp you can find. Something from the Gulf of Mexico would lend authenticity. And be careful scooping the flesh from the mirlitons. The skin is thin and can break easily.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19LOUISIANA/19LOUISIANA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 entree or 12 side dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "main course, mirliton, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 10}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 309, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1346 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 mirlitons (chayote squash)", "1/4 tablespoon butter, softened", "1/2 teaspoon lemon juice", "1 1/2 teaspoons chopped parsley", "2 1/4 teaspoons salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/3 teaspoon cayenne", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce", "3/4 cup bread crumbs", "1 tablespoon grapeseed, canola or other neutral oil", "3/4 cup sweet onions, chopped", "2 tablespoons bell peppers, diced small", "2 tablespoons celery, diced small", "2 1/4 teaspoons minced garlic (3 to 4 cloves)", "1/2 cup chopped green onions", "1/2 cup chopped tomatoes", "12 ounces of chopped shrimp (about 13 large, unpeeled shrimp)", "1 1/3 cups shrimp, chicken or vegetable stock"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut mirlitons in half and scoop out the large seed in the middle.
