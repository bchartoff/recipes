But really, this tart dessert was born in the United States as the ever-reliable lemon square. At Hartwood, the Mexican-modern-American restaurant in the beach town of Tulum, the crust is made with grated piloncillo, the traditional sugar there. (Raw sugar stands in nicely for home cooks elsewhere.) The crust is also scented with chamomile, which grows in huge thickets in the Yucat\u00e1n. Adding half a cup of sweetened shredded coconut to the dough for the crust is also a nice touch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/12/dining/20140312-TULUM-slide-QR50/20140312-TULUM-slide-QR50-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 12 bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, lime", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 92}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 303, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "246 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup raw sugar, preferably Sugar in the Raw brand", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cubed  ", "1/3 cup all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons dried chamomile (chamomile tea is fine), plus extra for garnish", "Freshly grated zest and juice of 4 to 5 limes (3/4 cup juice), combined", "4 large eggs", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Combine flour, sugar and salt in a bowl and toss to combine.
