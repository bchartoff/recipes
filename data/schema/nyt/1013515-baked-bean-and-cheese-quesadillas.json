{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Bean and Cheese Quesadillas", "description": "These quesadillas have little in common with fast-food varieties, which are made with flour tortillas and a lot more cheese. A Taco Bell cheese quesadilla has 480 calories and 1,000 milligrams of sodium; if you order cheese quesadillas at Baja Fresh, you\u2019re asking for 1,200 calories and 2,140 milligrams of sodium. I make a meal out of quesadillas by including beans or vegetables with the cheese, and I use corn tortillas rather than flour. Another plus: Quesadillas make a great destination for leftovers. Beans in a thick sauce make a delicious and comforting quesadilla filling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "One serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday", "keywords": "baked beans, cheese, gluten-free, healthy, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 474}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "482 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 corn tortillas", "1/3 cup cooked baked beans, homemade or canned, with sauce", "1 ounce grated Monterey Jack, Cheddar or mixed cheeses 1/4 cup", "Salsa for serving optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a microwave: Place a corn tortilla on a plate.
