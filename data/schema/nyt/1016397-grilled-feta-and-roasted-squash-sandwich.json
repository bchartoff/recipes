{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Feta and Roasted Squash Sandwich", "description": "I had a hunk of butternut squash lingering in my refrigerator, and it turned out to be the perfect ingredient for a grilled cheese and vegetable sandwich. I roasted it to bring out its sweetness, and paired it with chopped fresh sage, my favorite herb to use with winter squash. The rest came together quite naturally. The sweet and earthy flavors against the salty feta are perfect. You\u2019ll have more mashed roasted squash than you need for one sandwich. Use it in another, or freeze it for another night when you\u2019re too tired to cook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/27/science/27recipehealth/27recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "american, french, italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 594, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "952 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound butternut squash, peeled and diced (about 2 heaped cups diced squash)", "1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh sage", "3/4 ounce feta, crumbled (3 tablespoons)", "1 tablespoon chopped walnuts", "2 slices whole-grain country bread"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 425 degrees.
