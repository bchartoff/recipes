{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ombr\u00e9 Gratin", "description": "This stunning vegetarian Thanksgiving main dish belongs at the center of any table. Beneath a crispy, wispy golden crust of store-bought phyllo lies a gratin with layers of creamy autumnal vegetables in a colorful ombr\u00e9 pattern. Slice the vegetables very thinly using a mandoline for safety and ease (see Tip), and they\u2019ll bake up tender and creamy. Because each vegetable has varying densities and sugar levels, they benefit from individual attention: Salt each layer zealously, as the vegetables need a significant amount to offset their natural sweetness, and they really soak up the sauce. The sweet potatoes and squash may be sliced before you start cooking, but the potatoes should be done later, to prevent them from oxidizing, and the beets, to prevent them from falling apart. This creamy root vegetable gratin is exacting, and requires some effort, but its wow factor justifies the labor.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/09/dining/09VEG-THANKSGIVINGREX1-ombre2/09VEG-THANKSGIVINGREX1-ombre2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project, main course", "keywords": "beet, butternut squash, gratin, gruy\u00e8re, half and half, phyllo, red potato, sweet potato, christmas, thanksgiving, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2049}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the dish", "1 1/2 cups finely chopped shallots (from 4 large shallots)", "8 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns", "4 cups half-and-half", "8 fresh or dried bay leaves", "2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves", "3/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "3 large egg yolks", "2 1/2 pounds red potatoes (about 6 medium red potatoes), scrubbed", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "2 large beets (about 6 ounces each)", "10 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, grated (about 4 cups)", "2 large sweet potatoes (about 10 ounces each), peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced into 1/8-inch-thick slices (see Tip)", "2 pounds butternut squash (the neck of 1 squash), peeled, quartered lengthwise and sliced into 1/8-inch-thick slices (see Tip)", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/5 ounces unsalted butter", "16 phyllo pastry sheets, thawed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the middle of the oven and another right below it.
