{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Salad With Dill Vinaigrette", "description": "Making a giant green salad for yourself and your loved ones can be one of the best ways to create a formal break between work and dinner. This simple recipe features two different lettuces (romaine for sweet crunch and arugula for bitter spice) and a fat shower of herbs (parsley for freshness and dill for piquancy). Chilling your chopped and washed leaves in the refrigerator before dressing them is one of the best ways to get a restaurant-style green salad full of big, juicy crunch. For a savory, unknowable quality, add a splash of fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce \u2014 choose your own adventure.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/14/magazine/14mag-eat-site/14mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "arugula, dill, green salad, parsley, romaine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 910}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large garlic clove, finely grated", "1 tablespoon rice vinegar", "1 romaine heart", "2 packed cups arugula", "2 packed cups fresh parsley leaves with tender stems", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill", "1/2 teaspoon fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce", "Pinch of granulated sugar", "Salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the garlic and rice vinegar, and set aside to mellow out."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, trim the root end off the romaine heart and chop lettuce crosswise into bite-size pieces.
