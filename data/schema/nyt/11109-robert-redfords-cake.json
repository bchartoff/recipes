There's a flourless chocolate cake named after the late queen mother. (It was served to her once at tea in a private house, and, the story goes, she began featuring it at royal parties.) There is even a cake, a genoise layered with kirsch-flavored cr\u00e8me mousseline and strawberries, named after a bandleader, Ray Ventura, who was popular in France just after World War II. This cake was developed by the legendary baker Maida Heatter. Robert Redford was reported to have been wild about a chocolate cake sweetened with honey he ate in a Manhattan restaurant, so Heatter procured the recipe and gave it his name.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Reed"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, cakes", "keywords": "chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 18}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 442, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "85 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, plus additional for greasing pan", "Fine breadcrumbs or flour for dusting", "1 cup blanched hazelnuts or almonds", "12 ounces semisweet chocolate", "1/2 cup honey", "10 eggs, separated", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "12 ounces semisweet chocolate"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
