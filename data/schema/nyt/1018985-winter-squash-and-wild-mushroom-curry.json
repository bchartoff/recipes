{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Winter Squash and Wild Mushroom Curry", "description": "This is comfort food, Indian-style, adapted from a recipe by Madhur Jaffrey. It\u2019s also vegan, and perfect for a fall evening. Use a mixture of cultivated mushrooms; they come in all shapes and sizes. Look for royal trumpets, a large, meaty type of oyster mushroom; shiitakes, and small portobellos. Use some wild mushrooms too, if you can, like golden chanterelles, lobster or hen of the woods. You can make this as spicy as you wish, but be sure to include some cayenne and green chile, to complement and play off the creamy coconut milk sauce. Serve with basmati rice, rice noodles or mashed potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/dining/dt-mushroom-curry/merlin_167226351_071919ae-ee3e-4cd8-adb4-1d92e9261fc4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, curries", "keywords": "black mustard seeds, butternut squash, coconut milk, curry leaves, mushroom, shallot, fall, winter, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1387}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 180, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "461 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons vegetable oil", "10 ounces butternut or other winter squash, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 or 2 small green chiles, such as jalape\u00f1o or serrano", "3 medium shallots or 1 small onion, finely diced", "1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "Handful of fresh or frozen curry leaves (optional)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "Pinch of ground cayenne", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 pound mushrooms, preferably a mix of cultivated and wild, trimmed and sliced 1/8-inch thick", "3/4 cup coconut milk", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "Cilantro sprigs, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a wide skillet, heat oil over medium-high.
