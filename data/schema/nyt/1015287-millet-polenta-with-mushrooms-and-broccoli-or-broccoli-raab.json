But I made the mushrooms on the same day that I made the polenta in Millet Polenta With Tomato Sauce, Eggplant and Chickpeas and ended up spooning them over the millet, which was so delicious and comforting that I voted on the polenta as the accompanying grain. Cornmeal polenta would also work well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/29/science/01recipehealth/01recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 248, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "925 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 ounce (1/2 cup) dried mushrooms, like porcinis", "1 cup millet", "Salt to taste", "4 cups water or vegetable stock", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "6 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps sliced", "1 pound white or cremini mushrooms, wiped if gritty and cut in thick slices", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 shallots, minced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1/4 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon blanc (optional)", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley", "1 to 2 ounces Parmesan, grated (1/4 to 1/2 cup) (optional)", "1 bunch broccoli or broccoli rabe, broken into florets or coarsely chopped and steamed until tender, about 5 minutes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the dried mushrooms in a pyrex measuring cup or a bowl and pour on 1 cup boiling water.
