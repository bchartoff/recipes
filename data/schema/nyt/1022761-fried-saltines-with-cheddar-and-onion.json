Besides its ale \u2014 dark and light \u2014 the bar sells a modest, quirky, perfectly unpretentious cheese plate: Cheddar, raw white onions and saltine crackers with a side of spicy brown mustard. Here, with the minor update of frying the crackers, is a major improvement to an old offering. The plain dry crackers become nutty and extra crisp and salty, warm and rich. It\u2019s like the difference between raw cookie dough and a baked dark-edged batch fresh from the oven. With a sharp tang from Cheddar, the bite of raw onion and that final hit of vinegary mustard heat, this stacked fried saltine makes a lively bite with drinks in any era.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/16/dining/21mag-eat-site/21mag-eat-site-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "37 crackers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "crackers and chips, appetizer", "keywords": "cheddar, onion, saltine crackers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 375}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound Cheddar", "1 small white onion", "4 cups/32 ounces canola oil", "1 sleeve saltine crackers", "Yellow or brown mustard, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice the Cheddar in neat tablets slightly smaller than the saltines.
