{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Roasted Shrimp With Mezcal, Tomatoes and Arbol Chiles", "description": "Shrimp are like cotton balls, absorbing the flavor of whatever they bathe in. Whitney Otawka developed this dish for Cinco y Diez in Athens, Ga. The shrimp takes on the smoky notes of the tequila and roasted tomatoes and the deep heat of dried arbol chilies. Cooking the shrimp with the heads adds flavor to the sauce. The adventurous can break off the heads and suck in the juices. Make sure you have all the ingredients assembled next to the stove before hand. The cooking goes quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/06/dining/06JPSHRIMP4/06JPSHRIMP4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings as main dish, 4 as an appetizer", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, arbol chiles, mezcal, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 41}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 533, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "2100 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large Roma tomatoes", "3 dried arbol chiles", "1 cup clam juice", "2 tablespoons clarified butter, or ghee", "7 dried arbol chiles", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced white onion", "1 tablespoon minced poblano chile", "1 pound extra-large shrimp, or about 16, with the tail and the head left on but the body peeled", "2 ounces mezcal", "1 1/2 cups roasted tomato broth", "1 tablespoon lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving", "1 tablespoon minced cilantro", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt, depending on salinity of shrimp"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the broth:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a hot grill or on a grill pan, roast tomatoes until the skins are charred and soft.
