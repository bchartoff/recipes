As one origin story goes, shepherds in Amatrice brought guanciale, pecorino and pasta on their journeys, and made these dishes for sustenance. Guanciale (cured jowl) isn\u2019t especially common in the United States, so, in the spirit of the shepherds using what was available to them, this recipe uses salami. Like guanciale, salami gives off deeply flavored fat to build the pasta sauce on. But salami provides even more crispy bits of meat to stud this rich, silky, deceptively simple pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/17/dining/as-salami-pasta-alla-gricia/merlin_206068095_85a5f843-8ad3-4523-957c-471fa90f80e4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "pasta, pecorino, salami", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 269}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 pound tubed, curved or long pasta, such as rigatoni, orecchiette or spaghetti", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 (6-ounce) log mild or spicy salami, casing discarded and meat coarsely chopped", "1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper", "1 cup/2 ounces finely grated pecorino or Parmesan, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
