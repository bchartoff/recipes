{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Rolls With Shredded Broccoli Stems, Vermicelli and Red Pepper", "description": "Lately I\u2019ve been finding bags of shredded broccoli stems or broccoli stem slaw in supermarkets. I used just such a bag for this. You can grate the stems that come with your bunch broccoli for these, or you can save a bit of time and effort by buying the bagged product. \n\nWhichever way you go, these light, pungent spring rolls are easily assembled. The only problem you may have is if they sit for too long. If the broccoli stems have not been purged before you make the spring rolls they will continue to drain and the water can eventually dissolve the wrappers (I learned this when I made them, kept them overnight and took them the next day on a flight).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/17/science/20recipehealth/20recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Makes 8 spring rolls", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, dairy-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 175, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "382 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces rice vermicelli (thin rice sticks)", "1/4 cup rice vinegar", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "3 cups grated broccoli stems (it\u2019s fine to use a packaged mix of grated broccoli stems and carrots)", "Salt to taste", "4 ounces firm tofu, cut in 1x1/2-inch dominoes", "1 tablespoon light miso", "1 tablespoon chopped chives", "2 tablespoons chopped Thai basil or tarragon", "2 tablespoons mint leaves, coarsely chopped, plus additional leaves", "1/2 cup cilantro, chopped, plus additional sprigs", "8 inner romaine lettuce leaves, chopped", "16 to 24 pieces pickled ginger (to taste)", "8 8-1/2-inch rice flour spring roll wrappers"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the rice noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water.
