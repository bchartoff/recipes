{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Barbecue Sandwiches With Pickles and Slaw", "description": "Most turkey sandwiches are best made with slices of white meat stacked neatly between two slices of bread. Not this one. With a saucy, spicy filling piled onto a hamburger bun, it\u2019s perfect for dark meat and any scraps you may have leftover from the carcass. The cabbage slaw adds crispness and tang to the soft turkey, and bread-and-butter pickles give the sandwich a touch of sweetness. If you don\u2019t have leftover turkey in your refrigerator, this recipe works just as well with the meat torn off a rotisserie chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/22apperex3/merlin_164466594_a62e395c-e6b0-4ace-a1d1-8f3f41c8ecc0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, sandwiches", "keywords": "barbecue sauce, cabbage, hamburger buns, jalape\u00f1o, turkey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 63}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, plus more as needed", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "4 cups sliced green cabbage (about 1/2 small head)", "1 large shallot, thinly sliced", "1 large carrot, coarsely grated", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and thinly sliced", "1/2 cup barbecue sauce, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014733-pulled-pork-sandwiches\">homemade</a> or store-bought, plus more for serving", "Hot sauce (optional)", "12 ounces cooked shredded turkey, warmed up (about 3 cups)", "Mayonnaise (optional)", "4 sandwich or hamburger buns", "Bread-and-butter pickle slices, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small pot, combine 1/4 cup vinegar, the sugar and the salt.
