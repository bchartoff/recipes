Buttery and salt-kissed, the little pillows are essential from beginning to end. Start dinner with a warm roll, maybe two, split and swiped with butter. End it with another one or two used to mop up the delicious dregs of gravy. Throw in a few more in the middle because they are just too good not to. Let's hope it is a big basket. Thank goodness the recipe doubles easily. They're at their very best served warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/12/dining/12COOKING-CLOVERLEAFROLL2/12COOKING-CLOVERLEAFROLL2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 164}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 150, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "106 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (1/4-ounce/2 1/4 teaspoons/7 grams) package active dry yeast", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk, warmed to 105 to 110 degrees", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, plus more for the pan", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling", "1 large egg\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar into the milk.

With the mixer on low, add the yeast mixture and the egg and knead until the dry ingredients have been incorporated (you may have to help it along at first with a spatula) and the dough is smooth, about 5 to 10 minutes. Carefully add the melted butter (the dough will slosh around in the butter for a few minutes, but will eventually absorb it all) and continue to knead the dough until smooth, increasing the speed to medium, another 5 to 10 minutes. The dough will be shiny and elastic; if it\u2019s at all sticky, scrape down the sides of the bowl and gather the dough into a neat ball (no need to add extra flour).
