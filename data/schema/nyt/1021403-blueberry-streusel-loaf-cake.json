{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry Streusel Loaf Cake", "description": "Everything you love about a sweet, juicy blueberry muffin exists in this sliceable, streusel-topped loaf. Baking it at a higher temperature for the first 20 to 25 minutes helps achieve a crisp topping, while finishing it at a lower temperature helps ensure a moist center. This recipe calls for fresh blueberries, but frozen work, too. If you use frozen, don\u2019t thaw them first, and keep in mind that they may release additional liquid during baking, which will add more color to the loaf. One final tip: Tossing the fresh or frozen berries in a little flour before stirring them into the batter helps keep them suspended so that each and every slice is evenly studded with blueberries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/01/dining/ejm-blueberry-loaf/ejm-blueberry-loaf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "blueberries, butter, cinnamon, flour, loaf cake, oats, vanilla, fall, spring, summer, fourth of july, memorial day, mother\u2019s day, tailgate, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 584}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/45 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/30 grams old-fashioned oats", "1/4 cup/55 grams light brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "5 tablespoons/70 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 1/2 cups/220 grams fresh or frozen blueberries", "2 1/4 cups/290 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/75 grams light brown sugar", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the streusel: In a medium bowl, stir the flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together to combine.
