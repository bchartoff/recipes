{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Baking Spice", "description": "This fragrant baking blend splits the difference between pumpkin pie spice and apple pie spice, adding a bit of white pepper for some gentle heat, and cardamom for its deep, bright perfume. You can use a teaspoon or two in pies (apple, pumpkin and beyond), fruit and nut cakes and tortes, and all manner of cookies (especially shortbread). Or knead some into sweet breads like challah and brioche. Smaller amounts are wonderful sprinkled onto hot chocolate and rice pudding, and the blend will add depth to homemade ice cream when steeped in the custard before freezing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/24/dining/22Spicesrex5-baking/merlin_183521952_f974ff9f-0e5b-4e58-bd9d-8f824758004a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1/4 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, peppercorns, spice blend", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (2-inch/5-gram) cinnamon sticks, broken into pieces", "1 tablespoon/8 grams green cardamom pods", "1 whole nutmeg (2 grams)", "3/4 teaspoon/1 gram whole allspice berries", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams white peppercorns"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a small skillet over medium heat.
