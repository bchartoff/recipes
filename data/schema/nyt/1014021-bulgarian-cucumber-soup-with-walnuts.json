{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bulgarian Cucumber Soup With Walnuts", "description": "Walnuts are used in sweet and savory dishes throughout the Mediterranean. Along the Italian Riviera, a rich ricotta and walnut sauce traditionally is served with ravioli filled with greens. In Turkey, a thick, garlicky walnut sauce called tarator is served with cooked vegetables, much as a\u00efoli is in the South of France. In France, walnuts are added to salads, breads and many desserts, and they are eaten fresh as well as dried \u2014 a great delicacy in the fall, just after the harvest. I\u2019ve never encountered creamy, fresh walnuts in American farmers\u2019 markets, but if you know a walnut farmer, perhaps you could request some the next time they\u2019re harvested. Before the weather becomes too chilly for cold soups, try this one. Bulgaria once was well known for the number of centenarians in its population, which some scientists attributed to the daily consumption of Bulgarian yogurt. Now, both the yogurt and eating culture in this mountainous country have changed for the worse, and so have local lifespans.
