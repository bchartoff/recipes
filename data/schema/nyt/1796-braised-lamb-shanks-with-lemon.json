{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Lamb Shanks With Lemon", "description": "Many of us had our earliest experiences with braised foods not at the pricey restaurants that have recently rediscovered their appeal but at the Greek diners that never forgot it. So it's not surprising that I associate braised lamb shanks with egg-lemon sauce, a Greek staple. But when I set about to recreate this standard dish I found the sauce superfluous. Though a slow-cooked pot of braised lamb shanks and root vegetables becomes so sweet that it begs for something to counter it, it is also so rich that the thick sauce (a primitive form of b\u00e9arnaise, really) is overkill. Better, it seems to me, is to finish the braised shanks with what you might call lemon-lemon sauce, using both a lemon's zest and a lemon's juice. That little touch converts this dish from a delicious but perhaps one-dimensional stew to something more, a braise that may never look particularly elegant but tastes that way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/07/dining/07COOKING-BRAISEDLAMBSHANKS2/07COOKING-BRAISEDLAMBSHANKS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews, steaks and chops", "keywords": "lamb shanks, lemon, vegetables, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 202}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1137, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "76 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "sodiumContent": "2115 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "4 lamb shanks, roughly a pound each", "Salt and pepper to taste", "3 or 4 thyme sprigs", "6 cloves garlic, lightly crushed", "1 large onion, cut into chunks", "4 stalks celery, roughly chopped", "4 medium carrots, peeled and roughly chopped", "2 cups dry white wine or water", "1 1/2 pounds waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks", "1 lemon", "Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put oil in a large, deep skillet or casserole that can be covered later, and turn heat to medium-high.
