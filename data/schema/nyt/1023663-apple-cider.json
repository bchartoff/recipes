There\u2019s a place for both, but to fully savor the fruit, make raw, fresh cider. Benford Lepley, the co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/nyregion/cider-long-island-floral-terranes.html\">Floral Terranes</a>, a small-batch cidery and winery on Long Island, suggests using a mix of apples, ideally fresh ones grown in your general area, but Pink Lady is a supermarket favorite. Adjust the variety based on your preference of sweet to tart, then crush and press. (This recipe calls for a blender or food processor and a cloth-lined colander.) Drink and repeat all season long.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/22/dining/as-apple-cider/as-apple-cider-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "apple, fall, halloween, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds sweet apples, such as Honeycrisp, Fuji, Gala or Golden Delicious", "2 1/2 pounds tart apples, such as Pink Lady, Granny Smith, Gravenstein, Jonagold, Jonathan or Braeburn\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a colander or sieve with muslin or two layers of cheesecloth (allow for some overhang) and set over a large bowl or pot."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When making your own apple cider, follow the same guidance you\u2019d follow when eating raw fruit: Wash and dry apples thoroughly and remove moldy parts.
