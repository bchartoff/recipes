{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cherry-Almond Granola Crisp", "description": "For all the cobbler and crisp lovers, here\u2019s a simple dish that you can eat for breakfast or dessert. Chewy clusters of almonds and oats brown in the oven after getting coated in a nutty and floral browned-butter honey syrup. While the granola clusters caramelize, the bed of sweet cherries they rest over turns tender and juicy. Warm out of the oven, this crisp belongs in a bowl with your favorite yogurt, some of the warm cherry sauce drizzled over top, and maybe even a good shaving of dark chocolate or orange zest, if you have some.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/26/dining/jg-cherry-crisp/jg-cherry-crisp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack", "keywords": "almond, cherries, honey, rolled oats", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 557}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound/225 grams sweet cherries, halved and pitted (about 1 1/4 packed cups)", "1/3 cup/115 milliliters honey", "4 tablespoons/60 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup/100 grams sliced almonds", "1/2 cup/50 grams rolled oats", "Yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
