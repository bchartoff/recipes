{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies", "description": "What makes these cookies truly \u201cperfect\u201d isn\u2019t anything radical; it\u2019s simply an attention to detail. The pastry chef Ravneet Gill was meticulous in developing her recipe, and all of her instructions exist for a reason. When she tells you to chill your dough overnight, don\u2019t think you can skip over that. (If you do, your cookies will spread.) When she instructs you to roll the dough into balls before transferring them to the fridge to rest, do as she says, and you\u2019ll get a nice plump, domed cookie instead of a sad flat one. Don\u2019t go swapping in milk chocolate for dark, and chop the chocolate into large chunks for those dramatic, dense puddles of goo. One allowance: If you don\u2019t have Maldon salt, another flaky salt or even kosher salt will do.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Charlotte Druckman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/dining/16cookie4/merlin_177117912_a1ebb5f5-4632-4e07-85d2-0bd270dda5b2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT12H30M", "recipeYield": "14 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, chocolate chip cookie, freezer friendly, plan-ahead, superfine sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 7751}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/140 grams unsalted butter (1 1/4 sticks), softened", "Scant 3/4 cup/140 grams dark brown sugar", "2/3 cup/110 grams superfine sugar", "1 large egg", "1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/250 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon Maldon sea salt (or kosher salt)", "6 ounces/170 grams dark (bittersweet) chocolate, chopped into large chunks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the butter and both sugars in a stand mixer or mixing bowl.
