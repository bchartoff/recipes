Coquito recipes vary widely, but most include coconut milk, coconut cream, rum and sweetened condensed milk. Some have egg yolks, some don\u2019t. Others skip the cinnamon in favor of nutmeg. This adaptation, inspired by an ice cream sold at Torico Ice Cream in Jersey City, N.J., skips the evaporated and condensed milks, which can weigh down a batter. Instead, it gets sweetness and heft from egg yolks, coconut cream and just enough sugar. Alcohol can also make freezing ice cream tricky, so rum extract steps in here for the traditional white rum, keeping it boozy without affecting the texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Krysten Chambrot"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/22/dining/22Toricorex/merlin_198975339_c061f898-1d5c-4343-96fb-b0ce28622a2a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H45M", "recipeYield": "4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets, dessert", "keywords": "christmas, coconut cream, heavy cream, rum extract", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 83}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (15-ounce) can cream of coconut, preferably Coco L\u00f3pez", "1 (15-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "4 teaspoons rum extract, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Pinch of salt", "4 large egg yolks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare your ice cream machine, freezing the insert bowl if needed."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream of coconut, coconut milk, heavy cream, rum extract, sugar, cinnamon and salt.
