That lemon chicken is the inspiration for this dish, where a sweet lemony sauce coats crispy fried chicken pieces. This Middle Eastern version uses a cheater\u2019s preserved lemon paste and plenty of fresh lemon to brighten it up. You\u2019ll make a little more preserved lemon paste than you need; use it for salad dressing, toss it with roasted vegetables, or swirl it into soups. Serve this dish with some lightly cooked greens and plain white rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/20/dining/15ottolenghi-rex/merlin_194143470_f7fa28fa-f260-4f34-8e1e-a2fd7a2bb592-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, cornstarch, cumin seed, food processor, lemon, lemon juice, preserved lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3043}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium egg whites (About 2 ounces/60 grams) (save the yolks for another use)", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons cornstarch (cornflour)", "Salt and black pepper", "4 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters neutral oil, such as sunflower oil", "1 spring onion, trimmed and finely sliced at an angle", "1 tablespoon (about 5 grams) roughly chopped cilantro (coriander) leaves", "2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)", "1 large unwaxed (or well-scrubbed) lemon (about 4 ounces/150 grams), ends trimmed and discarded, then cut into 1/4-inch / 1/2-centimeter-thick rounds, seeds (pips) removed", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters lemon juice (from 2 lemons)", "2 teaspoons flaky sea salt", "3 cups/700 milliliters chicken stock", "1 1/2 tablespoons/25 grams unsalted butter", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "1 tablespoon superfine sugar (caster sugar), or granulated sugar", "1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and roughly crushed in a mortar and pestle", "1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch (cornflour)", "2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)", "Salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chicken: In a large bowl, whisk together the egg whites, soy sauce, cornstarch (cornflour), 1/2 teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper just until there aren\u2019t any lumps, about 30 seconds.
