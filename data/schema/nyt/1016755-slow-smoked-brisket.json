{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Smoked Brisket", "description": "This brisket is pretty close to Nirvana for Texas barbecue fanatics who rely on backyard equipment. No smoker is needed, no mops or mesquite \u2014 just time and fire and a reliable thermometer. The long, low smoke replicates the results of the bigger, hotter pits used in Central Texas: fork-tender, peppery meat, each bite bathed in drippings and juice. Use potato rolls or thick white bread to soak it all up.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/15/dining/15COOKING-SMOKEDBRISKET2/15COOKING-SMOKEDBRISKET2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT16H", "recipeYield": "At least 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, steaks and chops", "keywords": "brisket, peppercorns, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 287}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole beef brisket, both point and flat cuts, 10 to 14 pounds (see note)", "2/3 cup black peppercorns", "1/2 to 2/3 cup coarse salt, preferably Morton\u2019s kosher salt", "Hardwood charcoal", "3 cups wood chips, preferably oak, soaked at least 1 hour or overnight"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove brisket from any packaging and dry with paper towels.

At this point, you can continue cooking it on the grill, or in a 225-degree oven. In either case, remove brisket from grill and wrap in unwaxed parchment or butcher paper. Then wrap well in foil.

(Although the internal temperature will remain steady at about 180 degrees during this final cooking, it will take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours more for the meat, fat and collagen to soften completely. Start testing after 1 1/2 hours, prodding brisket with your finger to see how it responds: the meat should become soft and balloon-like, almost jiggly.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When meat is done, set aside for at least 30 minutes to let juices settle.
