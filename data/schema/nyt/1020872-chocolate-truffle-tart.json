{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Truffle Tart", "description": "This special occasion dessert takes a little time to put together, but it's much easier to make than it looks. It starts with a simple press-in chocolate cookie crust that doesn\u2019t require a rolling pin or chilling. The crust is filled with dark chocolate ganache and a layer of milk chocolate truffles. The truffles can be finished simply with cocoa powder, or coated in finely chopped nuts, powdered sugar or a colorful, tart powder made by crushing freeze-dried fruit. (Or you can skip the truffle recipe entirely and instead use store-bought truffles.) This is the moment to splurge on high-quality chocolate, as you\u2019ll taste it in the final result. Don\u2019t be tempted to use chocolate chips, as the added stabilizers make it difficult to achieve a shiny, creamy ganache. For picture-perfect slices, dip your knife in warm water before each cut and wipe it dry after.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/11/dining/em-truffle-tart/em-truffle-tart-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch tart", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "butter, chocolate, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, heavy cream, milk chocolate, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 10}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup/160 milliliters heavy cream", "14 ounces/400 grams high-quality bar milk chocolate (not chips), finely chopped", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature", "Cocoa powder, powdered sugar, finely chopped nuts, unsweetened shredded coconut, or freeze-dried fruit powder (see Tip), for finishing", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/200 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/30 grams cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream", "6 ounces/170 grams high-quality, bar dark chocolate (not chips), finely chopped", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 to 3 pinches kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the milk chocolate truffles: In a small pot, bring the cream to a simmer over medium heat.
