Then, just before serving, it all gets topped with an herb salad flecked with sweet oranges. It\u2019s light, fresh and very savory. You can substitute boneless chicken breasts instead, just halve them crosswise before marinating, and start checking them after 12 minutes of roasting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/12/dining/12apperex1/12apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "bay leaves, chicken thighs, orange, parsley, worcestershire sauce, low-carb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 205}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 335, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "628 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 fresh bay leaves, torn (or use 3 dried bay leaves)", "2 fat garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds", "1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest (reserve orange for salad)", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 3/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1 orange", "1 bunch parsley, leaves only", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon rice-wine vinegar, plus more to taste", "1 small garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, mix together bay leaves, garlic, oil, salt, mustard seeds, orange zest, Worcestershire sauce, cumin and coriander.
