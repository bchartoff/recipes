{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Sheet Cake With Raspberry Whipped Cream", "description": "This lovely cake was inspired by the colors and flavors of pink lemonade. Don\u2019t be tempted to skip the first step of this recipe, which asks you to rub lemon zest into granulated sugar: The sugar granules help release the essential oils in the zest, making for a brighter lemon flavor and fragrance. (If you\u2019re really short on time, you can skip using your hands and just mix with the paddle attachment inside the mixer bowl on low speed for 1 minute.) Slather this sunny cake with swoopy, easy-to-make raspberry whipped cream then serve as is, or dressed up with lemon zest or sprinkles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/03/dining/ejm-pink-lemonade-sheet-cake/ejm-pink-lemonade-sheet-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "1 (9-by-13-inch) cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "birthday, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, mother\u2019s day, butter, buttermilk, flour, heavy cream, lemon, raspberries, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1125}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "3 lemons, zested (about 5 tablespoons), plus 1/3 cup/80 milliliters lemon juice (from about 2 lemons)", "4 cups/510 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters vegetable oil", "6 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature", "12 ounces/340 grams (about 2 3/4 heaping cups) raspberries (thawed, if frozen)", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters heavy cream", "Lemon zest or sprinkles, for finishing (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
