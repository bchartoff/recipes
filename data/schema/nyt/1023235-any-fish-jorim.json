{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Any Fish Jorim", "description": "Fish jorims, braises such as eundaegu (black cod) and godeungeo (mackerel), are staples of Korean home cooking. This easy variation highlights the aromatic flavor of soy sauce, garlic and ginger, a combination that seeps into bone-in, skin-on fish. Steaks of black cod, mackerel and salmon work best here, as they seem almost to melt into rich silkiness, but you could use whatever fatty fish and cut you like. The whole red radishes in this recipe, replacing the more typical Korean radish slabs, gently boil in the salty-sweet liquid until tender, lending their vegetal sweetness to the velvety broth. A barely steamed, basically raw relish of scallions, red onion and jalape\u00f1o adds freshness and crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/15ESSENTIALSrex5/merlin_207587166_91a4b5e1-6e68-4e52-a744-6f3c5e571c1b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "cod, fish, radish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 135}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound trimmed whole red radishes (from about 1 bunch)", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "2 large garlic cloves, crushed and minced", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled, crushed and minced", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon gochugaru", "1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on pieces of fatty fish, such as black cod, mackerel or salmon steaks", "2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced on the diagonal", "1 very small red onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1 jalape\u00f1o, very thinly sliced into rings", "Steamed white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, wide pot or Dutch oven, place the radishes, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, sugar and gochugaru.
