{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cucumber-Avocado Salad", "description": "Crunchy cucumbers and creamy avocados are the stars of this simple five-ingredient salad. Peeling the cucumbers in alternating stripes helps them soak up seasonings while maintaining their shape. After being cut into bite-size pieces, they are combined with salt to draw out moisture, concentrating their flavor. Cubed avocado is tossed with lemon juice or vinegar to prevent browning, then everything is stirred together vigorously so that the avocado breaks down a bit to add a glossy coating. Finish with a hit of red-pepper flakes for heat, or embellish with herbs, lettuces, beans, soft-boiled eggs, feta, nuts and so on.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/13/dining/as-cucumber-avocado-saladd/merlin_189372006_a9ab5728-f86c-4727-aedf-3f1f6f4633b8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, side dish", "keywords": "avocado, cucumber, salad, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3271}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 scallions, trimmed then sliced crosswise 1/4-inch-thick", "Ice", "1 pound cucumbers (such as 6 Persian or mini seedless, or 1 English)", "Kosher salt", "2 very ripe avocados", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice, or unseasoned rice vinegar, plus more as needed", "Red-pepper flakes or hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Transfer the scallions to a small bowl of ice water to crisp."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the cucumbers in alternating strips and trim ends.
