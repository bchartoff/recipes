For this one, I cooked the onions with cabbage \u2013 even a half a head of cabbage that has been lingering in your refrigerator will work here \u2013 until both vegetables were soft, lightly colored and sweet. I added caraway seeds to the mix because I love the flavor of caraway with cabbage. I  used 1/2 teaspoon,  just enough so that people noticed; they couldn\u2019t recognize what it was (\u201cCumin?\u201d they asked) right away, but they liked it. I made the filling a day ahead and let it sit uncovered overnight in the refrigerator.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/21/dining/Cabbage-and-Spring-Onion-Quiche-With-Caraway/Cabbage-and-Spring-Onion-Quiche-With-Caraway-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 generously", "recipeCuisine": "french, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "halal, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 44}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 381, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "474 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup chopped spring onion", "1/2 medium cabbage (1 pound), cored and shredded (about 5 cups shredded cabbage)", "Salt to taste", "1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds", "2 egg yolks", "2 whole eggs", "1 (9-inch) <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016266-whole-wheat-pie-dough\">whole wheat p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e pie crust</a> fully baked and cooled", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "Freshly ground pepper", "2/3 cup milk", "3 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, grated, or 1 ounce Parmesan and 2 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, grated (3/4 cup grated cheese)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large, heavy skillet and add onions.
