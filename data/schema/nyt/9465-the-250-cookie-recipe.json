For \"only two-fifty,\" the waitress said, it was hers. But when the credit card bill arrived, the woman found the total near $300. Turns out the recipe cost $250, the story goes. In 1997, after years of enduring the myth, Neiman Marcus came up with a recipe \u2013 and gave it out for free. It's a delicious variation on chocolate chip cookies, using ground oatmeal, nuts and adding extra chocolate with a grated Hershey bar (you can use any brand you love).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Barbara Whitaker"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/09/dining/09COOKING-COOKIE2/09COOKING-COOKIE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 55 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chocolate, nuts, oatmeal, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2056}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 156, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "62 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup butter", "1 cup dark brown sugar, packed", "1 cup granulated sugar", "2 eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla", "2 1/2 cups oatmeal", "2 cups flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "12 ounces chocolate chips", "1 4-ounce milk chocolate bar", "1 1/2 cups chopped nuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cream together butter and both sugars.
