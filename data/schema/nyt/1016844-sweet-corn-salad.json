{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet-Corn Salad", "description": "Here's a recipe for sweet-corn salad designed to preserve the dignity of the solitary diner. The salad itself requires minimal cooking, which means the small amount of time you spend on it can all be attentive and quite personal. It amounts to simple cutting of kernels from the last of the season's corn cobs, and warming them in good olive oil with garlic, some scallions and a bit of chopped fresh vegetables, then finishing it all with chopped herbs. If corn season has ended, tender butter beans from a can, drained and rinsed, make a perfect substitute. Served with a wedge of good cheese and a thick cut of bread, the salad becomes part of a simple but complete meal, to be eaten in your own good company.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/05/magazine/05eat/mag-05eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for one", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, corn, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 87, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "208 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ears fresh sweet corn, shucked", "Olive oil", "1-2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "1/2 bulbed spring onion or 3 scallions, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt", "1 small handful cherry tomatoes, halved; or half a cucumber, quartered vertically, then chopped thinly across, or both", "Sprinkle of water", "A few drops red- or white-wine vinegar", "1 small handful fresh basil leaves, torn", "1 very small handful fresh marjoram leaves, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Scrape the kernels from each cob by holding it vertically in a large bowl, fat end up, and cutting kernels off, into the bowl, with a sharp knife.
