{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "World\u2019s Best Chocolate Cake", "description": "The recipe for this cake, adapted from \"Sweet\" by Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh, first appeared in an article written about Ms. Goh when she ran her cafe, the Mortar & Pestle, in Melbourne, Australia. Rather intimidatingly for her, the headline for the article was \"World\u2019s Best Chocolate Cake.\" It could actually be called lots of things: \u201cworld\u2019s easiest cake,\u201d possibly, requiring nothing more than one large bowl to make it all in. Or \u201cmost versatile cake,\u201d given that it can be served without icing and just a light dusting of cocoa powder, or dressed up to the nines, as it is here, with a thin layer of chocolate ganache and served with espresso cinnamon mascarpone cream. In the Ottolenghi shops in London, it is smaller and goes by the name Take-Home Chocolate Cake, designed to be shared by four people after a meal. This larger version is no less delicious, and keeps well for  four to five days. As with any baking project, you should weigh your ingredients in grams for the best results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/20/dining/20BAKE6/20BAKE6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cocoa powder, dark chocolate, espresso, instant coffee, mascarpone, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2489}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 914, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "67 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "40 grams", "sodiumContent": "565 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons/250 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks plus 1 1/2 tablespoons), at room temperature and cut into 3/4-inch/2-centimeter cubes, plus extra for greasing the pan", "7 ounces/200 grams dark chocolate (70 percent cocoa solids), chopped into 3/4-inch/2-centimeter pieces", "1 1/2 teaspoons instant coffee granules, dissolved in 1 1/2 cups/350 milliliters boiling water", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/240 grams self-rising flour (see note)", "1/3 cup/30 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder, plus 1 1/2 teaspoons, for dusting", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "7 ounces/200 grams dark chocolate (70 percent cocoa solids), broken or chopped roughly into 3/4-inch/2-centimeter pieces", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters heavy cream", "1 tablespoon light corn syrup", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon/375 milliliters heavy cream", "3/4 cup/190 grams mascarpone", "Scraped seeds of 1/2 vanilla pod", "2 1/2 teaspoons finely ground espresso", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "2 1/2 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit/170 degrees Celsius.

Get the food processor running again, with the chocolate still inside, and pour in the hot cream in a steady stream. Process for 10 seconds, then add butter.

For a thicker ganache with a spreading consistency, leave it for about 2 hours at room temperature. (The ganache can be stored at room temperature, providing it\u2019s not too warm, for 3 days or kept in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
