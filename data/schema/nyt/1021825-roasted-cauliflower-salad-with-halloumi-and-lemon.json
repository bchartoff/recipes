{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Cauliflower Salad With Halloumi and Lemon", "description": "Inspired by Mediterranean and Moroccan dishes, this tangy, earthy roasted cauliflower salad is a satisfying vegetarian meal. Spiced cauliflower, salty halloumi, peppery arugula, buttery avocado and a honey-lemon vinaigrette fill it with\u00a0contrasting textures, temperatures and flavors. There\u2019s lots of room for substitutions or additions: Swap in orange zest and juice for the preserved lemon, smashed green olives for the avocado or kale for the arugula. If looking to bulk it up, you could toss in some seared shrimp, roasted chicken, pearl couscous or whole grains.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/22/dining/aw-roasted-cauliflower-salad/merlin_181989474_49bca2ea-3ca5-4cf1-a0a5-7a275a0c0241-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, salads and dressings, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "arugula, avocado, cauliflower, halloumi, preserved lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1833}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large head cauliflower (about 2 pounds), cut into 1 1/2-inch wedges", "1/2 cup olive oil", "1 teaspoon Aleppo or 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander", "3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 small shallot, minced (about 1/3 cup)", "1/4 cup golden raisins", "1 large preserved lemon, seeded, halved, seeded, then very thinly sliced (about 3 tablespoons)", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon honey", "1 (8-ounce) block halloumi", "6 ounces baby arugula (about 8 packed cups)", "1 large ripe avocado, halved, pitted and diced", "1 cup torn fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender sprigs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees and set a large rimmed baking sheet on the middle rack."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower with 3 tablespoons olive oil, the Aleppo, coriander, turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
