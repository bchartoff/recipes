{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised and Grilled or Broiled Pork Ribs", "description": "The barbecued ribs I like best are cooked all the way through, using moist, relatively low heat, then finished over a high flame for a final browning. And you can nicely, if imperfectly, replicate this process by braising the ribs and then finishing them over the grill or in the broiler. Of course the broiler won\u2019t add wood flavor, but then neither will a gas grill or briquettes.\n\nWhat I did for the ribs in the recipe here was brown them, then slowly braise them in the oven (the top of the stove would work as well). When they were nearly falling off the bone I took them straight from the braising liquid and ran them under the broiler, just until they crisped up.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/11/dining/ribs-bittman/ribs-bittman-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "barbecue", "recipeCategory": "dinner, barbecues", "keywords": "dark beer, spare ribs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 121}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 821, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "67 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "792 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 4 pounds spare ribs", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "10 allspice berries", "2 or 3 3-inch cinnamon sticks", "10 nickel-sized slices unpeeled fresh ginger or 1 tablespoon ground ginger", "5 dried red chiles or a teaspoon of cayenne", "5 cloves garlic, lightly smashed", "1 bottle dark beer, like Guinness or any porter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
