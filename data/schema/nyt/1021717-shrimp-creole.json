{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp Creole", "description": "Much like gumbo, this shrimp and tomato stew starts with a roux that thickens and adds a distinct flavor (though many takes on shrimp Creole skip the roux altogether). Next, the \u201choly trinity\u201d of Creole cooking \u2014 onion, celery and bell pepper \u2014 is simmered in the roux. You\u2019ll want to stir the bottom of the pot constantly to prevent the roux from sticking and burning, and make sure to keep a close eye: A burned roux can\u2019t be saved. Creole cuisine relishes improvisation, so feel free to add other veggies or a different protein, or omit the hot sauce and add a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in its place. This spicy stew is traditionally served over steamed white rice, but is also delicious served over brown rice or other whole grains, like quinoa.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/12/dining/vl-shrimp-creole/vl-shrimp-creole-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "creole", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "creole seasoning, green bell pepper, shrimp, tomato sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3237}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon smoked paprika", "1 tablespoon chili powder", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or less, if desired)", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined", "2 teaspoons homemade or store-bought Creole seasoning", "1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1/3 cup all-purpose flour", "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped", "2 celery ribs, thinly sliced", "1 green bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce (no salt added)", "1 to 2 teaspoons hot sauce, to taste (optional)", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon dried basil", "2 dried bay leaves", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup chopped scallions", "1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems", "Steamed rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the optional Creole seasoning: Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and stir together.
