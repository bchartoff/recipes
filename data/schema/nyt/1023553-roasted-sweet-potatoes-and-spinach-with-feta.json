{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Spinach With Feta", "description": "A ho-hum sheet-pan of potatoes and greens this is not. Caramelizing sweet potatoes and wilting soft greens on a sheet pan is a smart way to cook two vegetables at once in this efficient and exciting recipe. There are bolts of pickled jalape\u00f1o, salty feta and scallions, but the pickled jalape\u00f1o brine is the key. It\u2019s used like a spicy vinegar, seeping into the sweet potatoes to complement their flavor. To make it a meal, top with a fried egg or roasted Mexican chorizo, swaddle in a pita or tortilla with tahini or sour cream, spoon onto grains or brothy beans, or into omelets or frittatas. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for up to a week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/07/multimedia/as-sweet-potatoes-spinach-feta-1-b638/as-sweet-potatoes-spinach-feta-1-b638-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "feta, jalape\u00f1o, make-ahead, sheet-pan, spinach, sweet potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1104}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled or unpeeled, cut into 1-inch pieces", "4 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons sliced pickled jalape\u00f1os, plus 3 tablespoons brine", "10 ounces baby spinach, kale, mustard greens or arugula", "3 scallions, thinly sliced", "2 to 3 ounces feta, sliced or crumbled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
