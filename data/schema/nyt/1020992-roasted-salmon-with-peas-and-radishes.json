The salmon is roasted skin-side up, to protect the delicate flesh and keep the fish moist. Peppery radishes mellow during cooking, turning slightly sweet and juicy as they soften. Browned butter, mustard and capers coat the peas and radishes in a tangy sauce, and white miso provides depth. If there\u2019s no miso to be found, just leave it out or sub with a splash of soy sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/26/dining/kc-salmon-and-radishes/merlin_171456852_42cb64a0-3710-44d9-859f-0ce12afe6718-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, seafood, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "dill, fish fillets, miso, mustard, peas, radish, salmon, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1055}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon or trout fillets", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 bunches radishes with greens (about 1 pound), radishes halved, 1 cup leaves reserved (or 1 pound diced zucchini, or two 14-ounce cans whole artichokes, drained and halved)", "1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen peas (no need to thaw)", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "1 tablespoon white miso", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/4 cup chopped dill or parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
