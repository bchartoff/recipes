{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggplant, Lamb and Yogurt Casserole", "description": "This hearty dish is inspired by moussaka, but simpler to prepare. Everything is baked in one roasting pan, with the different elements added in stages. Made with yogurt, cheese and egg, the topping cuts wonderfully through the richness of the eggplant and lamb, even though it lacks the body of b\u00e9chamel. If you can get them, sweet and properly ripened tomatoes would be better than the canned ones. This is best served with a piece of pita or a slice of white bread to scoop it all up.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/dining/19ottorex/19ottorex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, meat", "keywords": "canned plum tomatoes, eggplant, feta, greek yogurt, ground lamb, oregano, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 552}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 707, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1547 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 or 3 eggplants (aubergines) (about 1 1/2 pounds/680 grams), cut into 1-inch/3-centimeter cubes", "1 pound/450 grams ground lamb (lamb mince)", "1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1/2 cup/15 grams fresh oregano leaves, roughly chopped", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters olive oil", "1/4 cup/65 grams tomato paste", "6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "2 teaspoons ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 (14-ounce/400-gram) can whole, peeled plum tomatoes with their juices", "3 cups/700 milliliters chicken stock", "1/3 cup/20 grams roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley", "2 cups/450 grams plain Greek yogurt", "3 large egg yolks", "1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose (plain) flour", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 lightly packed cups/70 grams finely grated Parmesan", "1 cup/100 grams roughly crumbled feta", "Scant 1/3 cup/40 grams pine nuts", "2 packed tablespoons roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit/240 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the eggplant, lamb, onion, oregano, oil, tomato paste, garlic, cinnamon, allspice, red-pepper flakes, 1 3/4 teaspoons salt and a good grind of pepper to a 10-by-13-inch/26-by-34-centimeter (or similar) roasting pan (tin) and mix well to combine.
