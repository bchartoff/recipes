There are the classics, of course: your French onion dips and potted shrimp. And then there\u2019s rillettes. \u201cRillettes are incredible: smooth, fatty and intensely flavored,\u201d he wrote.

Bring to a simmer, cover and put the pot in the oven. Cook, checking every now and then, until the pork is falling apart and beginning to caramelize and the stock has almost entirely evaporated (remove the cover if necessary to get the liquid to evaporate; the bottom of the pot should be just about all melted fat when you\u2019re done), 2 1/2 to 3 hours."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Strain the mixture; reserve the fat and discard the garlic, bay leaf, rosemary and any gristle. Transfer the pork to a bowl and mash it into small shreds with the back of a fork. Add 1/4 cup of the reserved fat and stir to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper if you like (keep in mind that the colder you serve the rillettes, the less salty they will taste). Pack the rillettes into a mason jar or another container and refrigerate (covered tightly, they will keep for at least a week). Serve cold or at room temperature."}]}
