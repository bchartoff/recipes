{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pierogi Ruskie (Potato and Cheese Pierogi)", "description": "Pierogi are always on the menu at milk bars, historic Polish restaurants that were once socialist canteens. This recipe for pierogi ruskie, stuffed with potatoes and cheese, comes from the Bar Prasowy, which is one of the most famous milk bars in Warsaw, and a place where fist-size dumplings can be filled with mushrooms and meat, spinach and cheese, or any number of combinations. These pierogi can be made from kitchen staples, though you\u2019d be doing yourself a favor if you sought out the salty quark cheese that would be used in Poland. Be patient with your first few pierogi: Sealing the filling inside the dumpling takes some practice, but the practice itself is enjoyable. You can snack on the pierogi straight after boiling, or pan-fry them with butter until crisp and serve with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020984-classic-polish-borscht\">barszcz</a>, a light Polish borscht.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amelia Nierenberg"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/22/dining/21milkbarrex2/merlin_171379644_8f93d0c8-c7ca-41ae-a8f0-e09b4d0436ad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "24 to 30 pierogi", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, dumplings, project, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cottage cheese, polish, sour cream, waxy potato, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1983}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour (preferably unbleached), plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large egg, beaten", "1/2 pound waxy or all-purpose potatoes", "Salt and pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 medium yellow onions (about 8 ounces each), finely chopped", "1/2 cup quark cheese, cottage cheese or sour cream (about 4 ounces)", "Butter, for pan-frying (optional)", "Sour cream, for garnish", "Chopped fresh parsley or dill, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: Add the flour and salt to a large bowl; whisk to combine.

Fold the dough in half to enclose the filling, bringing the edges together to form a crescent shape.
