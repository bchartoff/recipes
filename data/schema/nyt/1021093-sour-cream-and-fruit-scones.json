{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sour Cream and Fruit Scones", "description": "The benefit of using frozen fruit in these tangy scones is in how it keeps the butter cold. Cold butter melts slowly in the oven, creating steam and tender pockets in the scones. The frozen fruit also doesn\u2019t get smashed the way fresh fruit does. You can freeze the scones before baking for up to a month, just add a few minutes to the baking time. They are delicious on their own or with a bit of butter, but, for extra credit, split and toast the scones, then mix a spoonful of sour cream with some freshly whipped cream and sandwich inside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/dining/18fruitrex2-scones/merlin_172489890_1541b2bc-b0a9-413e-9f59-96c9d3975606-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "8 scones", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dessert", "keywords": "butter, frozen fruit, scone, sour cream, mother\u2019s day, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1298}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the work surface", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick)", "1 cup frozen cherries (halved), peaches (in bite-size pieces) or berries", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters sour cream or plain full-fat Greek yogurt", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters milk (preferably whole, but whatever you have is OK)", "1 large egg, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees with a rack in the upper third.
