{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Orzo With Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Vinaigrette", "description": "A sun-dried tomato vinaigrette uses both the tomatoes and the aromatic oil in which they are stored for a deeply savory pasta meal. The vinaigrette serves double duty here as both a marinade for the tender chicken thigh morsels and a sauce for the orzo and feta. This dish tastes lovely warm, right off the heat, but it also makes for a wonderful cold lunch, like something you might find at an Italian American deli or salad bar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/12/dining/12THIGHSREX1-chicken-and-orzo-with-sun-dried-tomato-dressing/merlin_212197662_686fd631-661b-4361-8bff-4ea7a6ff395b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course", "keywords": "basil, chicken thigh, feta, make-ahead, orzo, pasta salad, sun-dried tomato, weeknight", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 169}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, plus 6 tablespoons oil from the jar", "2 cups tightly packed fresh basil leaves", "2 tablespoons white wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 large tomato, cut into 1/2-inch dice", "1 pound orzo", "1 (4-ounce) block feta, cut into 1/2-inch cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, blitz the sun-dried tomatoes and their oil, the basil, vinegar, red-pepper flakes, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper until smooth.
