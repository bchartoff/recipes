This simple chicken dish, adapted from Ms. Bracken, is as no-fuss as one would expect. Just sear the chicken in a bit of butter and transfer it to a baking dish. Scatter artichoke hearts (from a can, of course!) across the top. Make a quick saut\u00e9 of mushrooms, flour, broth and a little sherry and pour it over the chicken. Slide it into the oven and bake for about an hour. Ms. Bracken recommended serving it with baked potatoes, but we like it best with a pile of rice to soak up all of the flavorful sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alex Witchel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/dining/25COOKING-BraiCasserole2/25COOKING-BraiCasserole2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, casseroles", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, chicken, mushroom, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 696}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 505, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "885 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon paprika", "One 3 pound chicken, cut into pieces (or 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces)", "6 tablespoons butter", "8 ounces mushrooms, quartered", "2 tablespoons flour", "2/3 cup chicken broth or bouillon", "3 tablespoons sherry", "1 (12-to-15-ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
