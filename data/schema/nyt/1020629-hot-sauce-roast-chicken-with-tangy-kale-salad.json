{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hot Sauce Roast Chicken With Tangy Kale Salad", "description": "In his cookbook \u201cAm\u00e1: A Modern Tex-Mex Kitchen\u201d (Chronicle Books, 2019), the chef Josef Centeno experiments with the Tex-Mex cuisine he grew up eating in San Antonio. Barbecue chicken played a significant role, and he reinterpreted those flavors with a chile paste-rubbed chicken that gets basted with hot sauce as it roasts. This simplified version requires less work and comes together with pantry staples. Slip a few pats of butter under the skin (this ensures the meat stays moist), toss together a dry rub made with chile powder, cumin and onion powder, then rub it all over the chicken. Pop it into the oven and baste with a combination of hot sauce and melted butter every 10 minutes. The crunchy kale salad pairs well with the tangy, buttery chicken. A pile of rice or beans would round out the meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/13/dining/aw-hot-sauce-roast-chicken/aw-hot-sauce-roast-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, chili powder, cumin, hot sauce, kale, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 163}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (4- to 4 1/2-pound) whole chicken\u00a0", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), chilled", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 to 1 teaspoon ground chipotle or chile powder", "3/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1/2 lemon, cut into 2 wedges", "1/3 cup vinegar-based arbol hot sauce, such as Cholula or Crystal", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest, plus 5 teaspoons lime juice (from 2 limes)", "2 teaspoons dried oregano (preferably Mexican oregano)", "1 small garlic clove, finely grated", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "3/4 pound green cabbage (about 1/2 head), thinly sliced and chopped (about 4 cups)", "6 ounces Tuscan kale, stemmed, cut into thin ribbons", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro, mint or parsley, or a combination"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
