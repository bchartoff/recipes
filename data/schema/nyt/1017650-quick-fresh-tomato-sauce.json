{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quick Fresh Tomato Sauce", "description": "In August and September, when tomatoes are at their ripest, make a batch of fresh tomato sauce. At the market, look for the cracked, slightly bruised tomatoes sold at a discount. The flesh of the tomato should be dense, sweet and blood red. This makes a very fresh- and bright-tasting sauce in a manageable small batch. Take advantage of good tasty tomatoes and fill a few zip-top bags for the freezer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/26/dining/26KITCHEN1/26KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 2 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "summer, tomatoes", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1540}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 133, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "397 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 pounds tomatoes", "3/4 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 garlic clove, halved", "1 basil sprig", "1 bay leaf"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut tomatoes in half horizontally.
