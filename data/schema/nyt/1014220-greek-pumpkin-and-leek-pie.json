You can make the filling days before you assemble the pie; you can also make the whole pie ahead, wrap it well and freeze it. Like all winter squash, pumpkin is an excellent source of vitamin A, in the form of beta carotene, and a very good source of vitamin C, potassium, dietary fiber and manganese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/23/science/22recipehealth/22recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "Serves eight to 10", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "healthy, vegetarian, leek, phyllo, pumpkin, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 84}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 245, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "484 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds pumpkin, cut into large chunks", "6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "3 large leeks about 1 1/2 pounds, white and light green parts only, cleaned and chopped", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 cup chopped fresh dill", "1/4 cup chopped fresh mint", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 cup crumbled feta cheese (about 4 ounces)", "3 large eggs, beaten", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "12 sheets phyllo dough"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
