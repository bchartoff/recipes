Garlic and lemon play small roles here; the indisputable co-stars are the freshly cooked chickpeas and the nutty tahini. While it\u2019s well worth the effort to cook the dried chickpeas yourself, substituting a couple of cans of cooked chickpeas is perfectly acceptable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/07/dining/07HUMMUS/07HUMMUS-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, chickpea, tahini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1443}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 277, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "356 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried chickpeas", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "Juice of 1 1/2 large lemons (about 1/3 cup), more to taste", "2 to 4 cloves garlic, grated", "1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste", "1 cup sesame tahini", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, more to taste", "Paprika, for serving", "Olive oil, for serving", "Chopped fresh parsley, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, cover chickpeas by at least 2 inches of cold water.
