{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Tortilla Soup", "description": "This version of tortilla soup arises from a dish served at the Rose Garden restaurant in Anthony, Texas. We\u2019ve streamlined the original recipe, using chicken legs as the base of the stock, pulling off the meat when it\u2019s tender, and adding couple of beef bones to give the broth extra depth. Laila Santana, whose mother, Dalila Garcia, owns the Rose Garden, told us the recipe lends itself to improvisation. That it does, so feel free to tweak it to your tastes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/dining/Tortilla-Soup/Tortilla-Soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, editors' pick, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1024}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 766, "unsaturatedFatContent": "38 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "58 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "815 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds bone-in chicken thighs or legs", "1 pound beef bones, or a cut of beef with a lot of bone in it like short ribs, optional", "1 medium onion, quartered leave the skin on", "1 head garlic, halved across the equator leave the skin on", "1/4 cup vegetable oil, or more as needed", "6 corn tortillas", "Salt", "2 tablespoons canned chipotle chilies in adobo, or to taste", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "2 avocados, pitted, peeled and cubed", "4 to 8 ounces plain melting cheese, like mozzarella not fresh, Oaxaca or Jack, shredded or cubed", "Lime wedges for serving, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the chicken, the beef bones if you\u2019re using them, 3 of the onion quarters and the garlic in a large pot.
