This recipe comes from Olga Koutseridi, who spent her childhood summers in Mariupol, Ukraine, where vendors sold chilled ryazhanka that she\u2019d guzzle after a day at the beach. The slight caramel flavor comes from slowly baking whole milk, which can be done in the oven or a slow cooker, before mixing it with a fermented starter like sour cream or kefir.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/18/dining/16UKRAINIAN-RECIPESREX2/merlin_206153238_d1dff62e-14ab-4920-a476-3e4c1f276a3d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P3D", "recipeYield": "About 7 cups", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "dutch oven, kefir, milk, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 77}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 cups whole milk", "3 to 4 tablespoons plain whole-milk kefir (see Tip) or sour cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using an oven, heat to 225 degrees.
