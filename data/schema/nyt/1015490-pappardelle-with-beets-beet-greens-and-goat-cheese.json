I roasted my beets, blanched the greens and paired them with wide pappardelle noodles and goat cheese, both excellent partners. Make sure that you don\u2019t drain the water from the pasta pot when the noodles are done (lift them out with a pasta insert or with a skimmer), as you need some of the cooking water to thin out the goat cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/23/science/24recipehealth/24recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 39}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 421, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "515 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch beets, with a generous bunch of greens attached", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 or 2 garlic cloves, to taste", "10 ounces pappardelle", "4 ounces goat cheese", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon chopped chives (optional)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
