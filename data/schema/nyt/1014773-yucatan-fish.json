{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Yucat\u00e1n Fish", "description": "Yucatecan fare differs from other Mexican food. It is a cuisine rooted in the cooking of the native Maya people, crossed with that of the many conquerors who passed through. The ingredients there are rather particular; among them is achiote, also called annatto, a hard seed that imparts a delicious musky flavor and bright color to many marinades. \n\nAchiote is at its best in the company of garlic and hot chiles, along with an assortment of pungent spices, ground to a paste. The thick red sauce is diluted with the juice of sour oranges and tiny limes. The Yucatecan custom is to coat fish, tikin xic, with the spice mixture and wrap it in banana leaves with pickled onions before cooking. Fish prepared this way is always wonderfully moist, and the banana leaves, aside from making the ideal parcel for grilling or pit roasting, add a subtle aroma and taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/29/dining/29KITCH5_SPAN/29KITCH5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 56}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium red onion, thinly sliced", "Salt and pepper", "1 serrano pepper, sliced or chopped", "1/2 cup orange juice", "1/4 cup lime juice, more as needed", "2 teaspoons achiote (annatto) powder, available in Latino and Indian markets", "Pinch of cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano", "1/4 teaspoon chipotle chile", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seed", "1/2 teaspoon cloves", "6 allspice berries", "4 garlic cloves, smashed to a paste", "1 3/4 pound grouper or sea bass fillet, skin on", "2 ripe tomatoes, sliced thick", "Banana leaves, available in Latino and Asian markets, or use parchment or foil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pickled onions: Put onion in a bowl and season generously with salt and pepper.
