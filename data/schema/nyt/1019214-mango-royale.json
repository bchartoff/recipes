{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mango Royale", "description": "For the chef Isa Fabro of IsaMADE in Los Angeles, the use of super-ripe Manila mangoes (native to the Philippines) is central to this no-bake dessert, as the fruit has a unique deep honey taste, a creamy texture with virtually no fibers, and a heavy aroma. If using Kent or Haden mangoes, remove any excess fiber and add lime; the extra acid complements their flavor, but will compete with the Manila mangoes. As long as the mangoes are super-ripe, even over-ripe, the dish will be fine. If not, the mango flavor will become dulled and lost in the cold of the freezer. If ripe mangoes aren\u2019t available, frozen ones can be used once defrosted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/14/dining/14filipinorex1/14filippinorex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "One 9 1/2-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, graham cracker, mango", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 340}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cups/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 stick)", "2 sleeves/269 grams graham crackers (about 9 1/2 ounces)", "2 cups heavy whipping cream", "1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk", "6 to 8 soft ripe Manila mangoes (a.k.a.
