It has a place in kitchens around the world, in drinks and syrups and remedies and stews. The calyxes of the flower \u2014 the part we actually eat \u2014 also happen to have a high pectin content, making them ideal for jelly making. Lately, the ingredient has been marketed as a kind of health food, or meat substitute, but the ingredient has deep, ancient roots and stands on its own. Adriana Almaz\u00e1n Lahl, who owns a catering business in San Francisco, rehydrates the flowers and saut\u00e9s them with onion and chiles, then folds the spicy mixture into flour tortillas with a little cheese. The result is a quick, delicious meal, and an excellent way to use up the entire flower. Be sure to rinse the hibiscus well before you get started; grit hides in its folds.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/07/magazine/07mag-eat/98ceecea716044c0800cdaead2aa060b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 quesadillas", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, weekday, weeknight, tacos", "keywords": "hibiscus, quesillo, tortilla, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (packed) cup dried hibiscus", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola", "1 yellow onion, thinly sliced", "1 jalape\u00f1o, halved, seeded then thinly sliced lengthwise", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "1/4 pound quesillo, torn into bite-size pieces, or 1 cup grated Monterey Jack", "4 large flour tortillas", "1 handful cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse hibiscus under running water to remove any grit.
