{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian Skillet Chili", "description": "If you keep canned beans, tomatoes, onion and garlic in your pantry, you can make this dish on any weeknight without having to shop. The pickled onions aren\u2019t strictly necessary, but they are simple to make and add a welcome tangy contrast to the beans. Pickled peppers are a fine substitute. If you have a bell pepper or jalape\u00f1o or two, chop them up and saut\u00e9 them with the onions. And if you want to be fancy, grate the zest off the lime before juicing for the pickles, and stir it into the sour cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/31/dining/clark-skillet-chili-horizontal-sub/clark-skillet-chili-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday, weeknight, soups and stews", "keywords": "beans, tomatoes, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3143}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 317, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "959 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lime", "1 red onion or shallot, thinly sliced", "Large pinch of kosher salt", "Small pinch of granulated sugar", "Olive or grapeseed oil", "1 large onion, chopped", "3 garlic cloves, or to taste, minced", "1 teaspoon chile powder, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon dried oregano, plus more to taste", "2 (15-ounce) cans beans, drained", "1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes with their juices", "Kosher salt", "Fresh cilantro, diced avocado and sour cream, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pickled onions: Squeeze lime juice into a bowl, and add onion, salt and sugar.
