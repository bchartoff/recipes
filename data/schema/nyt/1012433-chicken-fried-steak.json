{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken-Fried Steak", "description": "Through good times and bad, the cube steak has remained a wallflower among meat cuts. Old-fashioned and a little mysterious, it\u2019s a steak without pretension, or maybe a hamburger with humble aspirations.\n\nThe term \u201ccube\u201d can be a little murky. It doesn\u2019t refer to the shape of the meat, which is usually beef but is sometimes made from pork, elk or other animals. Rather, it refers to both the shape of the dimples that checkerboard the surface of cube steak and the process that puts the dimples there. \n\nThose dimples provide more surface area for flour to cling to, which makes for crisper cutlets in recipes like this simply-prepared (no batter, just a generous dusting of flour) chicken-fried steak.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/15/dining/ks-chicken-fried-steak/merlin_150673200_ceab6f73-72f3-498b-b14d-e6564f9b1f33-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "cube steak, milk, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 154}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 862, "unsaturatedFatContent": "44 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "58 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "739 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Vegetable oil for frying", "2 cups flour", "1 1/2 tablespoons salt", "1 1/2 tablespoons pepper", "2 cups milk", "2 pounds cube steak, cut into 6 pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 200 degrees.
