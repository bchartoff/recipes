{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Zucchini With Miso Glaze", "description": "This dish plays on the sweetness and fruitiness of plump zucchini. Scoring the flesh in a crisscross pattern creates crevices for the miso glaze to seep into while also allowing the heat to penetrate the zucchini. Cooked quickly on high heat, the squash maintains its shape and heft, with flesh that is just tender enough. Covering the zucchini with a lid during cooking locks in all the moisture, ensuring that it becomes juicy. A grill pan is ideal for achieving smoky char marks, but you could also use a regular skillet or cook it on an outdoor grill (see Tip). If you are cooking for a group, count on one zucchini per person. Serve this as a side dish or with rice for a simple, quick and flavorful meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/13/dining/hm-miso-glazed-zucchini/merlin_204847749_41d8e027-01d0-41bd-a66c-82b14783feff-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, vegetables, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "mirin, miso, zucchini, summer, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 369}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 zucchini (about 2 pounds), washed and halved lengthwise", "3 tablespoons white miso paste", "2 tablespoons mirin", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce", "Neutral oil, such as vegetable or grapeseed (or nonstick spray)", "White or brown rice, for serving (optional)", "2 scallions, white and green parts, trimmed and finely sliced", "Toasted sesame seeds, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a sharp knife (a small paring knife works best), score the zucchini flesh in a crisscross pattern, taking care not to slice all the way through."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the glaze: In a small bowl, combine the miso paste, mirin, granulated sugar and soy sauce.
