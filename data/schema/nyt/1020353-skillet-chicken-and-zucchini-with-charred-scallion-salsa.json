{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken and Zucchini With Charred Scallion Salsa", "description": "Baked chicken breasts have a reputation for being dry, but pan-searing bone-in, skin-on breasts before roasting them helps them render their fat. It also forms a protective coating, develops a crisp, deep-golden skin and adds an extra layer of flavor. In this one-pot recipe, zucchini is tossed with the rendered chicken fat, and everything cooks together in the oven. Swap in any seasonal, quick-roasting vegetable for the zucchini, like cherry tomatoes or asparagus, but don\u2019t skip the charred scallion and jalape\u00f1o salsa. The zingy lime, grassy herbs and barely there brown sugar really make this dish sing. If cilantro isn\u2019t your thing, basil makes a fine replacement, or try a combination of the two. Alongside? Steamed rice would be nice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/16/dining/ch-chicken-breasts-with-zucchini-and-scallion-salsa/ch-chicken-breasts-with-zucchini-and-scallion-salsa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry, vegetables", "keywords": "chicken, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, light brown sugar, lime, scallion, zucchini, fall, spring, summer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 270}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (about 3 to 3 1/2 pounds), at room temperature", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons canola or grapeseed oil", "1 1/2 pounds zucchini (3 to 4 medium zucchini), quartered lengthwise, then halved crosswise", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (about 2 limes)", "1 medium jalape\u00f1o, thinly sliced, seeded if you prefer", "1 bunch scallions (about 7 or 8 scallions), trimmed and halved crosswise", "1 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon light brown sugar", "Flaky sea salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
