{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bircher Muesli", "description": "Essentially oats soaked in fruit juice, or milk, with nuts and fruit, Bircher muesli has a long history, and enough versions floating around to prove it. The original was created in the early 1900s by Maximilian Bircher-Benner, a Swiss doctor. It consisted of oats, grated apple, nuts, lemon and condensed milk and honey, but over time, people have gotten creative with the formula. This version is a choose-your-own-adventure recipe that is great to make ahead in large or small batches. Some recipes call for apple juice or applesauce for moisture, but this version uses creamy Greek yogurt instead. Tahini adds richness, but substitute another nut butter or skip it all together if you\u2019d rather. Swap out the nuts and dried fruit to suit your tastes and what you have. (Dates are especially nice.) Thin individual servings with more milk, if needed, then top with additional fresh fruit, nuts and a drizzle of maple syrup. It\u2019s cool, creamy, chewy and crunchy all at once.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/03/dining/ya-bircher-muesli/merlin_176509704_1741e216-e9e9-4c87-8a69-534f570da9c6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack", "keywords": "apple, greek yogurt, milk, pecan, rolled oats, tahini, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 672}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/100 grams old-fashioned rolled oats", "1/2 cup/115 grams Greek yogurt (preferably full-fat)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters milk or nondairy milk, plus more as needed", "2 medium apples, grated on the large holes of a box grater", "1/3 cup/40 grams chopped pecans", "2 tablespoons tahini (optional)", "2 tablespoons golden raisins", "2 tablespoons dried cherries", "Any combination of fresh fruit, dried fruit, chopped nuts and maple syrup, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a container with a lid, stir together the oats, yogurt, milk, apples, pecans, tahini (if using), raisins and cherries.
