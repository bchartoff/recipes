{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Velvety Scrambled Eggs", "description": "This recipe adapts a technique from making Chinese egg drop soup \u2014 gently poaching a thin stream of beaten eggs in simmering liquid \u2014 to a Western-style breakfast of scrambled eggs. The results are special and one of a kind. Drizzling the eggs into hot cream gets them to set into tender, velvety curds that end up bound with a rich custardy sauce, perfect for spooning onto buttered toast. The eggs are delicious without the herbs, but, given how rich they are, think of them as a special occasion dish, worthy of the added effort.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
