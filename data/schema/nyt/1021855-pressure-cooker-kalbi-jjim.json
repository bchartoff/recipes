Luckily, a pressure cooker makes it possible to enjoy this special one-pot stew whenever the craving hits. The ribs and vegetables simmer in the garlic and ginger-infused sauce until the meat falls off the bone and the vegetables absorb all of the rich juices. Bones give the sauce extra flavor, but boneless ribs also work great here. Chop leftover meat and vegetables and serve in corn tortillas with salsa for a tasty taco.
