The flavor of the drink will only be as good as your melon, so seek out the best cantaloupe, or other sweet orange melon, you can find. I don\u2019t add sweetener to the drink, but you can if you think it needs a little something.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/01/science/04recipehealthlime/04recipehealthlime-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 14}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 185, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "35 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 heaping cup diced cantaloupe or other sweet orange melon (about 7 ounces)", "1/2 cup fresh or commercial orange juice", "1 tablespoon soaked chia seeds", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice", "2 or 3 ice cubes (optional)", "1 teaspoon agave nectar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in a blender and blend at high speed for 1 minute.
