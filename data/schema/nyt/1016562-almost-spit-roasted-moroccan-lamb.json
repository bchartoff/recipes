{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Almost-Spit-Roasted Moroccan Lamb", "description": "For special occasions in Morocco, a whole lamb is turned on a spit over coals for hours, until the exterior is browned and crisp, with tender juicy meat within. Paula Wolfert, the great American authority on Moroccan food, gives this slow-roasting method for achieving similar delicious results in a home oven. Ask your butcher for front quarter of lamb (also called a half bone-on chuck). It is comprised of the neck, shoulder, front shank, and some ribs, all in one piece. Alternatively, ask for 2 large bone-in shoulder roasts. The lamb emerges succulent and fragrant, thanks to careful basting with butter and spices. Serve it with warm chick peas, cumin-flavored salt and a dab of spicy harissa.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/11/dining/11KITCH2/11KITCH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "coriander seeds, cumin seeds, lamb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 252}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 159, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "73 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 front quarter of lamb, about 10 to 12 pounds, or two 5- to 6-pound bone-in lamb-shoulder roasts", "Salt", "6 ounces unsalted butter, softened", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, lightly toasted and finely ground", "2 teaspoons coriander seeds, lightly toasted and finely ground", "2 teaspoons paprika", "1/2 teaspoon piment\u00f3n", "6 garlic cloves, smashed to a paste with a little salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim lamb of extraneous fat, but leave a thin layer of fat covering the meat (or ask your butcher to do this).
