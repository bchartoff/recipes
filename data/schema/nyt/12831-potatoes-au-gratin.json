{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potatoes au Gratin", "description": "The humble potato gets the red carpet treatment in this easy yet luxurious recipe for potatoes au gratin. Sliced Yukon Gold or russet potatoes (you can use either, but don't use a combination as they cook at different rates) are layered with half-and-half or heavy cream, topped with butter and grated cheese, then baked until golden and bubbly. Feel free to play around: Add leeks, onions, garlic or more cheese between the layers. Experiment with fresh or dried herbs. It's incredibly adaptable and practically foolproof. Just don't forget to season with salt and pepper as you go. Like all potato dishes, it needs plenty of seasoning.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/01/dining/mb-gratin/merlin_147141342_5554df8b-75f7-4e2e-b7ed-7284671a6426-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "butter, half and half, potato, gluten-free, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 392}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 4 pounds potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 to 3 cups half-and-half or heavy cream", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Gruy\u00e8re", "Pinch of nutmeg (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
