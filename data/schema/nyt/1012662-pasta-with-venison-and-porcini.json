{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Venison and Porcini", "description": "Back around the time the earth cooled, there was a restaurant, Giordano\u2019s, on West 39th Street near the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. Craig Claiborne gave it three stars in his 1968 \u201cNew York Times Guide to Dining Out in New York.\u201dAmong the specialties was saut\u00e9ed beef tenderloin, unusual because its sauce depended on white wine, not red. When I asked the chef about it, he said it was lighter that way.I had not made it in many years but as we tasted the 2004 Barolos and everyone\u2019s appetite was whetted for pasta with a beef rag\u00f9 and truffles, I thought of it. I decided to try it with venison and porcini to serve with fresh pasta. You\u2019ll need some last-minute stove work before you can put it on the table and pour that Barolo.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, pastas", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, mushroom, pasta, venison", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 14}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 772, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "787 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 venison tenderloin, 8 to 9 ounces, in 1-inch cubes", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt", "black pepper", "6 sprigs fresh thyme", "1 ounce dried porcini", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "2 teaspoons purple Brive mustard, or Dijon mustard", "1/4 cup minced shallots", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or half unsalted, half black truffle butter", "6 ounces fresh fettuccine or pappardelle"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place venison in a bowl, add 2 tablespoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and leaves from 4 sprigs thyme.
