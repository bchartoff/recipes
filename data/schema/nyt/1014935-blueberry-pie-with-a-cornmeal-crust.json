{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry Pie With a Cornmeal Crust", "description": "This recipe came to The Times from Diana Scott-Sho of the Luscious Little Dessert Company in Yonkers. A picture of this pie prompted many an email from readers asking where they could get the recipe.  What sets this pie apart from the usual summer berry is twofold. First, there\u2019s the nubby cornmeal crust, nearly as sweet as a cookie but still flaky. Second, there is the blueberry syrup drizzled on the top. This was a genius move on Ms. Scott-Sho\u2019s part. Rather than just letting the overflowing sugary juice fossilize on the baking sheet, she spoons it while still bubbling hot over the top of the pie. Not only does this make cleanup slightly easier, it adds a completely different textural experience. You get the jammy, juicy fruit, the crisp crust and then the syrup, which thickens into something akin to soft fruit leather, and far tastier.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/31/dining/31TAKEAWAY_SPAN/31TAKEAWAY_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "blueberry, cornmeal, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 208}, "recipeIngredient": ["290 grams all-purpose flour (about 2 1/2 cups), more for rolling out dough", "35 grams cornmeal (about 1/4 cup)", "35 grams sugar (about 3 tablespoons)", "2 grams salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)", "12 tablespoons butter, unsalted, chilled, cut into small cubes", "1/4 cup vegetable shortening, chilled, cut into small pieces", "135 grams granulated sugar (about 3/4 cup)", "30 grams cornstarch (about 1/4 cup)", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "1 lemon, zested and juiced", "6 cups fresh blueberries (about 3 pints)", "2 tablespoons milk", "1 tablespoon Demerara or raw sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: blend flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in a food processor.
