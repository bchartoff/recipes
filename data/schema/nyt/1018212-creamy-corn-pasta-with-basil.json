Be sure to add the lemon juice and fresh herbs at the end; the rich pasta really benefits from their bright, fresh flavors. And while this is best made at the height of corn season, it\u2019s still quite good even with out-of-season supermarket ears, or with frozen corn.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/13/multimedia/clark-corn-pasta/clark-corn-pasta-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "basil, corn, mint, Parmesan, pasta, scallion, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2878}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 549, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "498 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Fine sea salt", "12 ounces dry orecchiette or farfalle", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 bunch scallions (about 8), trimmed and thinly sliced (keep the whites and greens separate)", "2 large ears corn, shucked and kernels removed (2 cups kernels)", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, more for serving", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, more to taste", "1/3 cup torn basil or mint, more for garnish", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste", "Fresh lemon juice, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
