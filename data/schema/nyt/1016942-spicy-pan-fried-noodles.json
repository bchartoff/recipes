Most of the ingredients are pantry staples, which means you can make it whenever you need a comforting noodle dish that comes with a bite. If you can\u2019t find the Chinese egg noodles (also called Hong Kong-style noodles), you can make this with rice noodles or soba. The key is to only boil them until they are halfway done. (They should be pliable but still firm in the center.) They will finish cooking when you pan-fry them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/31/multimedia/clark-pan-fried-noodles/clark-pan-fried-noodles-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, lunch, noodles", "keywords": "chinese egg noodles, edamame, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1297}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 629, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1514 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup thinly sliced scallions (about a bunch; use both whites and greens)", "3 tablespoons soy sauce, more to taste", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "2 teaspoons rice wine or sherry vinegar", "1 teaspoon sesame oil", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "6 ounces Chinese (also called Hong Kong) egg noodles, soba noodles or rice noodles", "2 1/2 tablespoons peanut, grapeseed, safflower or vegetable oil, more as needed", "5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 large eggs, beaten with a fork", "2 cups washed baby spinach or 1/2 cup thawed edamame (optional)", "1 to 2 teaspoons sriracha or other hot sauce, or to taste", "Juice of 1/2 lime, or to taste", "1 cup cilantro leaves", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds or chopped roasted peanuts, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine the scallions, soy sauce, ginger, rice wine or vinegar, sesame oil and salt.
