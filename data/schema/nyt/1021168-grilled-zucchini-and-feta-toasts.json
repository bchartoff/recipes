{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Zucchini and Feta Toasts", "description": "Though its flavor is subtle, zucchini absorbs seasonings readily, and develops deep complexity when grilled. In this recipe, the grilled squash is doused with a flavorful oil made with garlic, cumin and coriander. If you have extra time, marinate the grilled zucchini pieces in the spice oil for up to 24 hours to help build flavor. You can serve the dish hot off the grill, or prepare in advance, then serve at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/11/dining/sl-zucchini-feta-toasts/sl-zucchini-feta-toasts-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weeknight, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "bread, cumin seeds, feta, lemon, olive oil, zucchini, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 279}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium zucchini (about 1 pound), trimmed and halved lengthwise", "1/2 cup olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 thick slices country or sourdough bread", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly crushed", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds, lightly crushed", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Grilled bread, for serving", "3 ounces feta, crumbled into large pieces", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high and brush the grates clean, if grilling outdoors."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "With a small spoon, scrape the seeds from the middle of zucchini halves and discard.
