{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Vegetable Bibimbap", "description": "The vegetarian cookbook author Lukas Volger has a way with Asian condiments and flavors. In this recipe for bibimbap, the egg-topped Korean rice bowl, he roasts squash, shiitakes and broccoli rabe in a sweet and spicy mix of soy, chile paste, sugar and oil. Mr. Volger crisps cooked rice in a skillet to get the characteristic crunch of bibimbap; you can prepare the rice up to three days ahead, but be sure to crisp it just before serving. If you want to skip that step, use freshly cooked rice instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/09/dining/09MARTHA2/09MARTHA2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "broccoli rabe, butternut squash, gochujang, rice, sambal oelek, shiitake, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 231}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1140, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "212 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "16 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "667 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small or 1/2 large butternut squash", "Neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed oil", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon brown sugar", "2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean fermented chile paste) or sambal oelek, more for serving", "8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, caps cut in half if large", "1 generous bunch broccoli rabe, thick bottom stems trimmed and discarded", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil (optional)", "5 cups cooked white or brown rice, or mixed grains", "4 eggs", "1 cup sprouts or shoots, such as broccoli sprouts, mung bean sprouts or sunflower shoots, for garnish", "1/2 cup quick cucumber pickles, for garnish (optional; <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018012-quick-pickles\">see recipe</a>)", "Lime wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
