{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grouper Fillets With Ginger and Coconut Curry", "description": "The chef Patrick Jamon applies French cooking techniques to tropical ingredients grown, caught or gathered near his restaurant, Villa Deevena in Los Pargos, Costa Rica. He is particularly fond of grouper, which is often caught by his son Dean and served at the restaurant, but you could substitute red snapper, cod or mahi-mahi. When reducing the coconut milk, be sure to keep it at a simmer rather than a boil, so it doesn\u2019t curdle. Red curry paste can vary in its intensity by brand, so you'll want to adjust the amount to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/dining/20villarex1/merlin_150673179_4dea3e99-91f6-45a5-9f33-f3c4141dfd0a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, curries, seafood", "keywords": "cilantro, coconut milk, curry paste, ginger, grouper, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 170}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 420, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "749 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 grouper fillets (about 6 ounces each), skin removed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 teaspoons olive oil", "1 spring onion (or the white portion of 1 large leek), trimmed, cut into 2-inch segments and julienned (about 1 cup)", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon minced fresh turmeric or 1 teaspoon dried turmeric", "1 small carrot, peeled and julienned", "1/2 cup snow peas, julienned", "1/2 cup fresh or frozen green peas", "1 (13-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "1 tablespoon red curry paste, plus more if needed", "1/4 cup cilantro leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 225 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the fish generously with salt and pepper.
