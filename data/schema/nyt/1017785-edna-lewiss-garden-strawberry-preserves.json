The cooking should be as brisk as possible without scorching; it should take about 9 minutes in all."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "As soon as the preserves begin to boil up, a scum will rise on the surface; skim it off right away with a wooden or silver spoon. It is much better to skim while it's rapidly boiling, because that seems to cause the scum to remain in a mass, and it's easy to dip it out without getting too much of the syrup."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "After 9 minutes of rapid cooking, pour the preserves into the hot jars, filling to about 1/8 inch from the top. Lift the jars out onto a dry surface to cool. When cold, carefully melt paraffin and pour into the filled jars. When paraffin is cool, put on the lids and seal."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017785-edna-lewiss-garden-strawberry-preserves"}
