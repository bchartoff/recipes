{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tempeh Tacos", "description": "Hard-shell tacos, or tacos dorados, have a long history in northern Mexico and immigrant communities in California and Texas. In 1951, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/business/19bell.html\">Glen Bell</a> added them to the menu of his drive-in stand in San Bernardino, Calif. He would go on to found (you guessed it) Taco Bell, the fast food chain, which would help popularize hard-shell tacos in the United States. While the typical hard-shell taco is made by piling spiced and saucy ground meat and a party of toppings into a shatteringly crisp shell, this vegan version calls for tempeh. Tempeh is made by fermenting cooked soybeans into a spongelike cake with a porous structure that browns, crumbles and soaks up big flavors incredibly well. Here, it\u2019s seasoned with well-toasted tomato paste, ground cumin, chili powder and smoked paprika, as well as nutritional yeast for added umami. That said, the recipe can also be made with vegan store-bought meat crumbles if you prefer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/11/dining/as-tempeh-tacos/merlin_195007356_b952b455-b2e3-4776-8302-d8c64b2d716f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, weeknight, tacos, main course", "keywords": "nutritional yeast, taco shells, tempeh, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 773}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons neutral oil (such as grapeseed or sunflower), plus more as needed", "2 (8-ounce) packages tempeh, crumbled into roughly 1/2-inch pieces", "1 large yellow onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "2 teaspoons chili powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons nutritional yeast", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon red hot sauce, plus more to taste (optional)", "12 hard taco shells, warmed", "Desired toppings, see Tip"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat the oil over medium-high.
