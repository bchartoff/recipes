If you prefer a creamier curd, just reduce the heat before you add the beaten eggs to the pan, and stir the mixture slowly until the eggs are set. These Tunisian-inspired eggs make a satisfying one-dish meal. The eggs are spiced with cayenne or harissa, ground caraway and coriander.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/19/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "bell pepper, eggs, potato, healthy, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 29}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 259, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "770 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound boiling potatoes, diced", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 small onion, finely chopped", "1 pound mixed green and red bell peppers 2 large peppers, seeded and sliced", "4 garlic cloves, pur\u00e9ed in a mortar with 1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/2 pound tomatoes, seeded and grated on the large holes of a grater, or peeled, seeded and diced; or 1/2 of a 14-ounce can of diced tomatoes, drained", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground caraway seeds", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground coriander seeds", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper more to taste or 1 teaspoon harissa", "6 to 8 eggs, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam the potatoes in a steamer placed over one inch of boiling water for 10 minutes or until tender.
