{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Corn Ice Cream With Blackberry Verbena Sauce", "description": "Because this ice cream uses so few ingredients, wait until the depths of summer, when you can get really good, sweet, plump ears of corn. Taste a kernel before committing yourself. If your ears are on the less sweet side, save them for the savory parts of the meal where it matters a little less. The blackberry sauce, flavored with verbena, is a wonderful topping for this ice cream, but you could use fudge instead. Even unadorned, this ice cream deserves to be the golden finale.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/14/dining/14COOKING-CORNICECREAM/14COOKING-CORNICECREAM-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "1 1/2 pints", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "blackberry, corn, lemon verbena, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 90}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 254, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "76 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ears fresh corn, shucked", "1 1/2 cups milk", "2 cups heavy cream", "225 grams granulated sugar (about 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon)", "6 large egg yolks", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 cup sour cream", "2 sprigs lemon verbena or 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1 1/2 cups blackberries (about 6 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a large knife, slice the kernels off the corn cobs and place in a large saucepan.
