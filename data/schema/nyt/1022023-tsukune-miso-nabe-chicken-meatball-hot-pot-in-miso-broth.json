{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tsukune Miso Nabe (Chicken-Meatball Hot Pot in Miso Broth)", "description": "Naoko Takei Moore makes this comforting hot pot of ginger-spiked meatballs, mushrooms and tofu in a donabe, or Japanese clay pot. She sells them at <a href=\"https://toirokitchen.com/\">Toiro</a>, her Japanese cookware shop in Los Angeles, and has written a book on the topic, \u201cDonabe: Classic and Modern Japanese Clay Pot Cooking\u201d (Ten Speed Press, 2015). The traditional cookware can be used to cook rice, steam foods and even set up to work like a small grill. It\u2019s a wonderful, versatile piece of equipment, though if you don\u2019t have one, you can use another heavy-bottomed pot with a lid, and still turn out a beautiful meal. Have this hot pot on its own, or with a side of warm rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/28/magazine/28mag-eat/28mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "ginger, ground chicken, mirin, miso, mushroom, scallion, tofu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 397}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground chicken", "2 scallion greens, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "1 tablespoon white miso", "1 tablespoon potato starch", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 quart <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/3213-dashi\">dashi</a>", "2 tablespoons mirin", "3 teaspoons white tamari, or soy sauce", "1/4 cup white miso", "8 ounces mixed mushrooms, such as shimeji, maitake and enoki, sliced or torn roughly into bite-size pieces", "14 ounces soft or medium-firm tofu, cut or scooped out into about 8 pieces", "4 ounces spinach, pea shoots, rapini or other tender greens, cut into bite-size lengths", "1 tablespoon roasted white sesame seeds", "Ground yuzu shichimi togarashi, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the meatballs: In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients for the meatballs, and knead with your hands until the mix is smooth and shiny.
