{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Fish Tikka With Spinach", "description": "Tikka marinade imbues meats and veggies with extreme flavor: Complex, layered heat comes from garam masala and red chiles, garlic adds a delicate depth and ginger a mellow freshness, while yogurt cools, tenderizes and extends flavors from the spices. Though traditionally anything with tikka marinade is cooked on coals for smokiness (see Tip), the flavors come together well in a home oven. This recipe calls for any fleshy white fish that can stand this mix of heady spices and maintain its structural integrity for 12 to 15 minutes in the oven. Lay the fish on a bed of spinach, and the marinade will flavor both. The preparation is simple for this recipe, but the flavorful results are anything but.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zainab Shah"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/20/dining/sheet-pan-fish-tikka/merlin_213164982_cd945d6e-69e7-445b-bb81-8c7f70f312fb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, seafood, main course", "keywords": "garam masala, sheet-pan, spinach, white fish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 875}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds firm, white-fleshed fish (such as cod, basa or halibut, cut into chunks)", "1/4 cup olive oil or any neutral oil", "2 tablespoons full-fat Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon garam masala", "1 teaspoon Kashmiri or other red chile powder", "1 teaspoon ginger paste or freshly grated ginger", "1 teaspoon garlic paste or freshly grated garlic", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Fine sea salt", "1 pound baby spinach (about 14 packed cups)", "Rice or roti, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
