{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Onion and Poppy Seed Hamantaschen", "description": "Traditionally filled with apricot, prune or poppy seed jam, triangular hamantaschen cookies are a prized treat for the Jewish holiday of Purim. This dessert serves as a reminder of the Jewish people\u2019s deliverance from Haman, who sought to exterminate Persia\u2019s Jews in the fifth century B.C. This recipe is fully savory, tucking crumbled feta under thyme-scented caramelized onions, but you could just as easily fill the buttery dough with sweet jam to please traditionalists. When forming hamantaschen pastries, make sure to leave an opening wide enough for the filling to be visible but small enough to retain moisture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/13/dining/13purim-A1-ref/merlin_151680807_a7c32aeb-94d0-45a8-b0a2-16b0cb62b9ae-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 36 hamantaschen", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, pastries", "keywords": "feta, honey, onion, poppy seed, thyme, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 72, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "49 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "Kosher salt", "10 tablespoons/140 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "1 1/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar", "1 large egg, yolk and white separated", "Ice water, as needed", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large onion, halved and very thinly sliced", "2 fresh thyme sprigs", "1 fresh or dried bay leaf", "1 teaspoon honey", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon poppy seeds", "3 ounces good-quality feta or goat cheese, crumbled (about 1/2 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a food processor.
