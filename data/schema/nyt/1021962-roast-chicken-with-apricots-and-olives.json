{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Chicken With Apricots and Olives", "description": "This festive dish is a fairly easy main course for the Seder meal \u2014 or anytime. Marinating overnight leaves very little work on the day of serving, but two hours is enough to infuse the chicken with tangy citrus and the sumac. Dried apricots, already more tart than sweet, are marinated along with the chicken and become almost savory in the oven. Using pitted Castelvetrano olives will save you a lot of elbow grease, and their meaty texture and mild flavor are perfect here. After roasting together, everything goes under the broiler to deeply brown and thicken the cooking juices into a tasty sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/dining/12Passoverrex1/merlin_184703202_ceadb25e-bc60-43bf-a895-a823f01a429d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "apricot, blood orange, chicken, olives, shallot, sumac, passover", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 932}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 to 4 pounds bone-in chicken pieces (see Note)", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, plus 1 lemon, sliced and seeded", "1/4 cup fresh blood orange or regular orange juice", "1/4 cup honey", "4 to 6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "3/4 teaspoon dried thyme", "3 tablespoons ground sumac", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "1 cup (6 ounces) dried apricots", "1 cup (4 ounces) pitted Castelvetrano olives with 2 tablespoons brine", "4 large or 8 small shallots, roots trimmed, peeled and cut lengthwise into quarters or halves", "1/4 cup dry white wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slash each piece of chicken through the skin a few times, about 1 inch deep.
