{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Ginger Cake", "description": "David Lebovitz's headily spiced cake, which Amanda Hesser wrote about in The Times in 1999, calls for a quarter-pound of fresh ginger. Mr. Lebovitz, who was a pastry chef at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., has since had a long career as a cookbook author and blogger. But this recipe, from his cookbook \u201cRoom for Dessert,\u201d is from relatively early in his writing career. Boldly flavored with just cinnamon, cloves, black pepper and, yes, a lot of fresh ginger, it is simplicity exemplified, coming together quickly and without a mixer. The cake \u2014 much like the recipe itself \u2014 ages well, its flavors melding and deepening over time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/10/dining/08ESSENTIALREX3-CAKE/merlin_196837461_399f5ed4-7388-4109-9cb7-864ca6ba8d15-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "christmas, thanksgiving, fresh ginger, make-ahead, molasses", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1482}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 504, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "279 milligrams", "sugarContent": "45 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup mild molasses", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed, vegetable or canola", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "4 ounces fresh ginger, peeled, sliced and finely chopped", "2 eggs, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position rack in center of oven and heat to 350 degrees.
