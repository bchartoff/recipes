{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Pepper Stir-Fried Tofu and Asparagus", "description": "This fast, one-skillet stir-fry dinner combines vibrant spring vegetables with hearty tofu in a rich and spicy black-pepper sauce. (Use freshly ground pepper, if possible, for the ideal combination of flavor and heat.) The tofu is simmered in the fragrant sauce, which is spiked with aromatic garlic and ginger until it has absorbed all of the flavors and is nicely glazed. This recipe is perfect for using up that pencil-thin asparagus, which cooks quickly and toes the line between crisp and tender, while sweet snap peas balance out the assertive sauce. The dish can be served over baby spinach or in lettuce cups instead of with rice for a satisfying salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/17/dining/kc-black-pepper-tofu-and-asparagus/merlin_206514636_fcb540cd-3185-4dce-af80-fad1f65db27d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, one pot, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, pepper, snap peas, tofu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 848}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce\u00a0", "2 tablespoons turbinado or light brown sugar\u00a0", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce or a vegan alternative", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning\u00a0", "1 pound firm tofu, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1 large shallot, finely chopped", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon minced peeled ginger", "1 pound pencil-thin asparagus, woody ends trimmed, cut into thirds", "4 ounces snap peas, thinly sliced on the diagonal", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro", "Steamed short-grain brown or white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon black pepper and 2 tablespoons of water.
