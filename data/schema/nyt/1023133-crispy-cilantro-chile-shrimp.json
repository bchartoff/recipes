{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Cilantro-Chile Shrimp", "description": "These zesty, pan-fried shrimp are inspired by the cuisine of Maharashtra, the state on the west coast of India that includes Mumbai. Maharashtrian cooking often features lots of seafood and bright, fresh flavors, like the wallop of cilantro that flavors this dish. (Pur\u00e9eing cilantro, as in this recipe, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/dining/14curious.html\">changes the enzyme</a> that makes it taste soapy to some people, and reveals a deeply savory, almost mellow side to the herb.) A coating of farina, of which Cream of Wheat cereal is made, gives a dramatically craggy, crunchy texture; rava or semolina flour also work well. Be sure to pat the farina onto the shrimp before frying to help the coating adhere. Serve the shrimp with flatbreads, like chapatis.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/21/dining/sd-green-chile-shrimp/merlin_205522575_03f362de-3f31-4862-981a-09f2dc688757-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, farina, serrano pepper, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 147}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces cilantro leaves and stems (about 2 medium bunches or 1 large bunch), cut to fit into a blender", "5 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 serrano chile, stemmed, halved and seeded", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus up to \u00be cup for frying", "1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon lime juice (from about 1 lime), plus lime wedges for serving", "3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon garam masala", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/2 pounds large or extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined and tails removed", "1 1/4 cups farina, rava or semolina flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the cilantro, garlic, chile, 2 tablespoons oil, ginger, lime juice, turmeric, garam masala, cumin, coriander, cayenne and 2 teaspoons salt in a blender.
