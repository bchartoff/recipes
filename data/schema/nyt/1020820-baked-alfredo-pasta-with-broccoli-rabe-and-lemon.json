Take the typical pasta Alfredo that's prepared in a skillet: It\u2019s delightfully creamy and lush, but the same, bite after bite. But add a green vegetable to that Alfredo pasta, pile it into a dish, top it with melty cheese and a crunchy bread crumbs, then bake it, and you get a vegetarian dinner that's got it all. If broccoli rabe isn't your thing, you can substitute cut asparagus or broccoli florets.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/dining/as-baked-alfredo-pasta/as-baked-alfredo-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "broccoli rabe, mozzarella, panko, parmesan, pasta, fall, winter, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 378}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "2 cups finely grated Parmesan", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest (from 1 lemon)", "Black pepper", "1 pound casarecce, cavatappi or other small tubed or curly pasta", "1 bunch broccoli rabe, trimmed, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 small garlic clove, grated", "6 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 500 degrees.
