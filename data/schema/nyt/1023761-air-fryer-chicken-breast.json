{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Air-Fryer Chicken Breast", "description": "By some kind of magic, an air fryer can transform a chicken breast into an easy, flavorful dinner with minimal effort. Part of this sorcery takes a cue from Eric Kim\u2019s dry-brined chicken breast <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022238-dry-brined-chicken-breasts\">recipe</a>, which calls for cutting the chicken breast in half, allowing you to pluck the smaller piece from the air fryer as soon as it\u2019s done, leaving the thicker part to remain in the air fryer longer and preventing any overcooked bites. Paired with vinegar, soy sauce acts less as a salt and more as a marinating agent in this recipe. The circulating heat and compact space of the air fryer allows the ingredients to reduce into a sweet and slightly sticky sauce as they collect at the bottom, emboldening their flavors.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eleanore Park"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/22/multimedia/ep-air-fryer-chicken-breasts-1-d643/ep-air-fryer-chicken-breasts-1-d643-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "1 to 2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for one, for two, lunch, quick, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "air fryer, chicken breast, rice vinegar, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 356}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 11 ounces)", "Salt", "Freshly cracked black pepper", "2 teaspoons light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "2 teaspoons olive oil", "Lime wedge (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat air fryer to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken breast dry with a paper towel.
