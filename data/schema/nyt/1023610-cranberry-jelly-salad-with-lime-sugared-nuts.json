{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry Jelly Salad With Lime-Sugared Nuts", "description": "Chopped nuts and fruit bound by a wobbly sweet-tart gelatin, often called Jell-O salad in the Midwest, form a beloved side dish full of potential. Serve this gleaming cranberry variation at Thanksgiving or any holiday meal, and feel free to swap out the apple here for peeled and chopped oranges or canned diced pineapple, or use a mix of your favorite fruits. (Note that certain fruits like fresh pineapple, mango, kiwi and papaya contain enzymes that prevent gelatin from setting.) To make the lime-sugared walnut garnish even more surprising, toss it with a smidge of citric acid to give it an incomparable sourness that citrus juice alone can\u2019t provide.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/30/magazine/30mag-Eat-site/30mag-Eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "side dish", "keywords": "apple, cranberry, gelatin, lime, make-ahead, pecan, plan-ahead, salad, walnut, fall, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 208}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans", "2 limes", "1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon citric acid (optional)", "Nonstick cooking spray or neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola", "2 cups cranberry juice cocktail or apple juice", "2 (1/4-ounce) packets unflavored powdered gelatin", "3 cups/12 ounces fresh or frozen thawed cranberries", "1 medium green apple, unpeeled, cored and coarsely chopped (2 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a small skillet over medium-high, then add the nuts and toast, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant and slightly darker in color, about 30 seconds.

Dip the mold into the hot water (don\u2019t let hot water get inside the mold) until the edges of the gelatin look wet, a few seconds to 3 minutes depending on the thickness of your mold. Cover the mold with a large plate and quickly (and confidently) flip it. You can make this jelly up to 3 days in advance; keep the unmolded gelatin covered and refrigerated until ready to unmold, and be sure to unmold a few minutes before serving for a softer texture.
