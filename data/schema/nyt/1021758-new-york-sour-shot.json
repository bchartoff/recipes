{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "New York Sour Shot", "description": "A wine-spiked whiskey sour, the New York Sour is a potent combination of bourbon, lemon, sugar and sometimes egg whites. Top each of these shots with dry red wine for a more classic experience \u2014 both in looks and in taste \u2014 or swap out the wine entirely for sweet red vermouth. The slightly more herbal flavor makes up for what it lacks in striking visuals. This alternative float is especially ideal if you don\u2019t have or don\u2019t want to open a full 750-milliliter bottle of red only to put a few ounces to use. (That\u2019s less of an issue if you plan on drinking wine later in the night, but you do you.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/30/dining/28shotsrex2/merlin_181421811_da42e20f-6a34-4460-a1cc-c89bb3f4cc23-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "8 shots", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bitters, bourbon, lemon, vermouth, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 271}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice", "4 ounces bourbon or rye", "2 ounces fresh lemon juice", "1 ounce <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013660-simple-syrup\">simple syrup</a>", "2 dashes Angostura bitters", "2 ounces dry, fruity red wine or sweet red vermouth"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine the bourbon or rye with lemon juice, simple syrup and bitters.
