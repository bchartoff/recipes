{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Houseman's Roasted-Squash Salad", "description": "At Houseman, the restaurant Ned Baldwin and Adam Baumgart opened in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Manhattan in 2014, you\u2019ll find this astonishing salad made with red kabocha squash. But the more easily found green kabocha works beautifully in the recipe, as does buttercup squash and sugar pumpkin. For the dressing, some confidence is required. What seems an enormous amount of dried spices \u2014 ground fennel, sumac and coriander \u2014 is combined with chopped parsley and cilantro. The result looks dry and grainy, as if something is wrong. But olive oil, lime juice and white-wine vinegar (best available, please!) begin to smooth things out, and the cheese, pistachios and vinegar-plumped currants finish the job. The combination makes a fine vegetarian main-course lunch or dinner, particularly paired with braised greens and good bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/20/magazine/20eat1/20mag-20eat-t_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "currants, squash", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 313}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 399, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "390 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons dried currants", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar", "1 kabocha squash, approximately 3 to 4 pounds", "Approximately 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon ground fennel seed", "1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon ground sumac", "1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 cup chopped parsley, packed", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro, packed", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice, approximately 3 to 4 limes", "1/2 cup pistachios, toasted and chopped", "1/2 cup firm feta cheese, diced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the currants in a small bowl, and pour the white-wine vinegar over them.
