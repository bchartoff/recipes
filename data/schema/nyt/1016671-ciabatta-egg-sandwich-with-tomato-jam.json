{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ciabatta Egg Sandwich With Tomato Jam", "description": "This corner deli\u2019s bacon-egg-and-cheese-on-a-roll makes a trifecta of promises, but Robert Newton\u2019s version of the sandwich, encased in bread that\u2019s both crusty and springy, actually fulfills them. Yes, \u201ctomato jam\u201d sounds weird, and having to make your own ketchup before your first cup of coffee, even worse. But, the jam can be prepared in advance, and the payoff of its savory tang \u2014 paired with hearty bacon, fresh eggs and deep, complex Cheddar \u2014 render the prep time a mere trifle of an inconvenience. Whether you\u2019re trying to cure a hangover, or impress brunch guests, this recipe will always gratify.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julie Scelfo"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/23/dining/23SUBGONE1/23SUBGONE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "ciabatta bread, coriander", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 76}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 294, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "450 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Olive oil", "1 large shallot, diced", "1 clove garlic, minced", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh ground fennel seeds", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "1 anchovy fillet", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "10 ounces canned or boxed tomato pur\u00e9e", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoons salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "8 eggs, preferably fresh from a local farm", "8 slices sharp Cheddar cheese", "8 slices bacon, preferably Burgers\u2019 Smokehouse Original Country Bacon, available at Bklyn Larder", "4 ciabatta rolls"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the tomato jam:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the tomato jam: In a medium saucepan, warm 3 tablespoons olive oil over low heat, then add shallots. Once they soften, add garlic. Cook for about 1 minute, or until the garlic starts to soften but not brown, then add the coriander and ground fennel. Allow the spices to toast slightly and become aromatic, adding more oil as needed so the mixture remains a thick paste and the herbs do not burn. Add the brown sugar and anchovy; use a wooden spoon to mash them into the paste. Once they are combined, deglaze the pan with lemon juice, then add the tomato pur\u00e9e, oregano, salt and pepper to taste. Raise heat until mixture starts to boil, then turn it down and gently simmer about 30 minutes, whisking often, until jam thickens. Remove from heat and add salt to taste.
