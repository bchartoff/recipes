{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Scallion Pancakes With Squid", "description": "The textures in this delicious recipe for pajeon, traditional Korean scallion-based pancakes, are manifold: meaty from the squid, crunchy yielding to soft from the fried bits of batter, juicy from the scallion. It came to The Times from Hooni Kim, the chef at Hanjan in Manhattan. One of the secrets to this pancake is waiting for the oil to heat up before mixing the batter. That way, the batter doesn\u2019t sit around and turn gluey. Eat them as hot as you can without burning your fingers. The risk is worth it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/19/dining/clarkeSeafood-Pancake/clarkeSeafood-Pancake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, scallion, squid", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 139}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 881, "unsaturatedFatContent": "43 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1406 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup soy sauce", "6 teaspoons rice wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon mirin", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons Korean denjang (fermented soybean paste) or Japanese red miso paste", "1 tablespoon grated garlic", "1 teaspoon grated ginger", "1 egg yolk", "Grapeseed or vegetable oil, for frying", "200 grams rice flour (about 1 1/3 cups)", "150 grams all-purpose flour (about 1 cup)", "4 grams baking powder (about 1/2 teaspoon)", "1 pound squid, cleaned and cut into 1/2-inch rings", "2 bunches whole scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, prepare the dipping sauce.
