{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Panzanella With Mozzarella and Herbs", "description": "At the height of tomato season, for every perfectly ripe, taut and juicy specimen, there\u2019s an overripe, oozing counterpart not far away. The Tuscan bread salad called panzanella is the perfect place to use those sad, soft tomatoes that are still rich in flavor. Traditional panzanella is made with stale, dried bread that\u2019s rehydrated from a dressing of sweet tomato juices, vinegar and plenty of olive oil. This version also includes some mozzarella for richness and cucumber for crunch. It\u2019s an ideal make-ahead dish; the longer the mixture sits (up to 6 or so hours), the better it tastes. Just make sure your bread thoroughly dries out in the oven so it won\u2019t turn to mush.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/dining/08APPE2/08APPE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, bread, mozzarella, tomatoes", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 704}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 293, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "561 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces ciabatta or baguette, preferably stale, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 3 cups)", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more to taste", "3/4 teaspoon kosher sea salt, more to taste", "2 pounds very ripe tomatoes, preferably a mix of varieties and colors", "6 ounces fresh mozzarella, torn or cut into bite-size pieces", "1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion, about half a small onion", "2 garlic cloves, grated to a paste", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, more to taste", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano or thyme (or a combination)", "Large pinch red pepper flakes (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "Black pepper, to taste", "1/2 cup thinly sliced Persian or Kirby cucumber, about 1 small cucumber", "1/2 cup torn basil leaves", "1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, roughly chopped", "1 tablespoon capers, drained"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
