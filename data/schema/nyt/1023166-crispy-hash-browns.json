Packing the patties tightly and allowing the starch and cheese to bind the shredded potatoes achieves a crisp outer layer. Although the patties may seem somewhat loose before cooking, they\u2019ll fuse together in the hot oil, forming a formidable crust. Make sure not to disturb the patties: Let them fry until perfectly golden before flipping.
