{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggnog Overnight French Toast", "description": "Like a good pitcher of eggnog, this French toast is rich, sweet, boozy and covered in nutmeg. Slicing the bread but keeping the base connected not only makes this an attractive breakfast centerpiece, it also feeds family and friends with little effort since all the servings bake simultaneously. Allowing it to soak in the refrigerator overnight deepens the dish\u2019s flavors. Don\u2019t worry about forcing the bread pieces apart when pouring in the soaking mixture: The loaf will flower naturally as it bakes. This dish is sweet enough to eat without a final drench in maple syrup, but it\u2019s great with a mountain of fresh, tart berries. A little homemade whipped cream wouldn\u2019t hurt either.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/13/dining/13BREAKFASTREX2/merlin_198975486_587446e6-0999-4f48-b6fb-3d6228f0fc84-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, main course", "keywords": "christmas, new year\u2019s day, french toast, heavy cream, stale bread, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1121}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (16-ounce) day-old, plain country bread loaf (oblong or similarly shaped)", "2 large eggs", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1 cup heavy cream", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1 tablespoon dark rum, brandy or bourbon", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "Freshly grated nutmeg, for dusting", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Have a rimmed dish or pan (about 1 inch deep) that fits the bread loaf snugly nearby.
