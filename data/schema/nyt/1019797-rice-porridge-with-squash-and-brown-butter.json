{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Porridge With Squash and Brown Butter", "description": "This recipe for a rich, winter-y rice porridge comes from Minh Phan, the owner of Porridge + Puffs in Los Angeles. Ms. Phan is a porridge whisperer, creating all kinds of complex, beautiful rice bowls, and her velvet porridge rich with roasted squash is no exception. To make a simple version of it at home, roast a mix of squash then pur\u00e9e it with brown butter and a little half and half. Stir the mixture into loose, cooked rice for a comforting meal you can eat plain, topped with pickled vegetables and herbs, some browned sausage or dressed salad leaves. Ms. Phan lets the cooked rice rest overnight so the grains absorb the seasoning evenly, but if you\u2019re in a rush, you can go ahead and eat it right away.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/02/magazine/02mag-Eat-image1/02mag-Eat-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, grains and rice", "keywords": "half and half, medium-grain rice, pickled vegetables, squash, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 197}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 715, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "503 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups water", "1 cup medium-grain white rice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "Black pepper, to taste", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds mixed squash, such as honeynut, kabocha or butternut", "4 tablespoons vegetable oil", "6 ounces unsalted butter", "1/2 cup half-and-half", "Handful of fresh herbs, such as mint, lemon balm or basil, to garnish", "Pickled vegetables, to garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a pot, add the cold water and rice, and place over medium heat.
