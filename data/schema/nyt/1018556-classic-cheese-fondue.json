{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Cheese Fondue", "description": "This traditional Swiss fondue \u2013 the sort you might have encountered in an Alpine ski lodge circa 1972 \u2013 calls for an equal amount of Gruy\u00e8re cheese, for its depth of flavor, and Emmenthaler, for its supple texture; a shot of kirsch, for its cherry aroma and alcoholic oomph; and a little garlic, for bite. It takes all of 15 minutes, and will emerge as magnificently creamy, smooth and velvety as custard, but with a funky, deep flavor that dazzlingly enriches anything you dunk in the pot: bread cubes, apple slices, clementine sections, nuggets of salami, pretzels, tofu. It is even marvelous spooned onto a romaine lettuce salad in place of dressing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/dining/cheese-fondue/cheese-fondue-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 886}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 495, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "861 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small garlic clove, halved", "1 cup dry white wine", "3/4 pound Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated", "3/4 pound Emmenthaler, raclette or Appenzeller cheese, grated", "1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 to 2 tablespoons kirsch (optional)", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste (optional)", "Crusty bread cubes; steamed broccoli or cauliflower; carrot, celery or fennel sticks; cubed apple; seedless grapes; clementine sections; cubed salami, soppressata or kielbasa; roasted chestnuts and/or dried apricots, for serving."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rub cut side of garlic on inside of large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan, preferably cast iron, rubbing the bottom and halfway up the sides.
