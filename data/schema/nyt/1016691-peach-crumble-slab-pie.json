{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach Crumble Slab Pie", "description": "Juicy, fruit-filled, buttery and gently spiced, this recipe splits the difference between a peach pie and a crumble: a flaky, all-butter crust is a bed for the jammy sliced peaches, but a cinnamon-scented crumble tops it all off. Even better, this recipe feeds a crowd, making it ideal for toting to a picnic or barbeque. When peaches and nectarines aren\u2019t in season, you can make this with a mix of plums and blueberries, cherries or ripe sweet pears. It\u2019s best eaten after it cools on the day you bake it, but no one will turn it down the next day, either.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/26/dining/mc-peach-crumble-slab-pie/mc-peach-crumble-slab-pie-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, peach, pie", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 500}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 556, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "372 milligrams", "sugarContent": "39 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/300 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed", "3/4 teaspoon/4 grams fine sea salt", "2 1/2 sticks/10 ounces/285 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "4 to 6 tablespoons ice water, as needed", "6 pounds ripe peaches, nectarines or a mix, pitted and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "1 1/4 cups/135 grams packed light brown sugar, more to taste", "1/3 cup/50 grams instant tapioca", "Zest of 3 lemons", "3 tablespoons/45 milliliters fresh lemon juice", "1 1/2 teaspoons/5 grams finely grated nutmeg", "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped, or 1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon/6 grams fine sea salt", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/200 grams packed dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons/10 grams ground cinnamon", "1 1/2 teaspoons/3 grams ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams fine sea salt", "1 1/2 sticks/6 ounces/170 grams unsalted butter, cubed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In a food processor, briefly pulse together flour and salt.
