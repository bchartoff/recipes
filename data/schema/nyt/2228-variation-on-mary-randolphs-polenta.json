Leave to cool and firm. When firm, cut it into small rounds, about 1 1/2 inches across. A liqueur glass will do as a kind of cookie cutter; dip glass in cold water periodically to avoid sticking. Use remaining butter to grease a shallow baking pan or gratin dish. Crush garlic clove with flat blade of a knife and soften it, over low heat, with remaining butter."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
