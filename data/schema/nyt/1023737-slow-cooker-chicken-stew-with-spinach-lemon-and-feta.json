{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Chicken Stew With Spinach, Lemon and Feta", "description": "This meal-in-a-bowl is inspired by Greek-style vegetable dishes like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020478-greek-lemon-potatoes\">lemony potatoes</a> or garlicky spinach. Here, potatoes and chicken thighs slow cook in a punchy mix of lemon, garlic and herbs; add the spinach at the very end so that it retains its freshness. Russets can be substituted for Yukon golds, but their texture will be more grainy and less creamy. A bunch of mature spinach or frozen spinach works best here because of its mellow flavor, as opposed to baby spinach, which is more tannic. Add the amount of dill that sounds best to you, or if you don\u2019t like it, swap in a few tablespoons of fresh parsley or mint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/07/multimedia/sd-chicken-stew-1-bbae/sd-chicken-stew-1-bbae-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H15M", "recipeYield": "5 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, feta, garlic, slow cooker, spinach, yukon gold potato, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 622}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs", "1 1/2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes (about 3 medium), scrubbed, halved lengthwise and sliced into 1-inch wedges", "8 large garlic cloves, smashed and finely chopped\u00a0", "1 shallot, finely chopped", "3 cups chicken broth\u00a0", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\u00a0", "1 heaping tablespoon roughly chopped fresh rosemary (leaves of about 1 large sprig) or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary", "1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "3/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes\u00a0", "Black pepper", "Juice of 1 large lemon (about 1/4 cup juice)", "1 (8-ounce) bunch mature spinach, stems included, chopped, or 1\u00bd cups frozen spinach", "1/4 to 1/3 cup lightly packed roughly chopped dill\u00a0", "Crumbled feta and crushed pita chips, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the chicken, potatoes, garlic, shallot, broth, olive oil, rosemary, oregano, salt, garlic powder, red-pepper flakes and several generous grinds of black pepper.
