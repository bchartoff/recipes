{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chile Crisp", "description": "There\u2019s just enough oil to slick all the crispy bits of chile, onion and sesame in this version of the spicy Chinese condiment, so it delivers as much crunch as it does salty, sweet, nutty heat. Dried minced onion from the supermarket spice aisle is a shortcut for the usual step of frying fresh minced onion, and it improves the crispness, too. You can experiment by mixing the hot and fruity flavors of different dried chile varieties, crushing them into flaky bits, or stick with ready-to-add red-pepper flakes. No matter what you use, this blend adds a little excitement to everything.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/12SAUCESREX9-hot-GK-chile-crisp/merlin_190218933_34ab049b-7d60-41d2-8685-34f2e44c5a4a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "chiles de \u00e1rbol, onion, sesame seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1239}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup vegetable oil", "1/4 cup dried minced onion", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/3 cup finely crushed dried small red chiles or red-pepper flakes", "3 tablespoons sesame seeds", "1 teaspoon coarsely ground Sichuan peppercorns (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the oil, onion, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan.
