{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hearty Bean Nachos With Spicy Salsa", "description": "According to Dr. Adalberto Pe\u00f1a de los Santos, the director of the International Nacho Festival, in Piedras Negras, Mexico, there are three timeless nacho essentials: crispy corn tortilla chips, mounds of melted cheese and at least one chile. If you want to go big, here are some unofficial guidelines: Nacho toppings should be good enough to stand on their own, the nachos should be saucy (maybe even messy) and they should be so delicious together that you can\u2019t have just one bite. In this recipe, nachos take a vegetarian turn, with buttery pinto beans, tender carrots or sweet potatoes (or both), and a tomato-and-tomatillo salsa. Melty cheese, Mexican crema and chopped onion and cilantro take it over the top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/04/dining/29nachosrex2/merlin_179172954_f28f94f2-a915-4df4-8605-441f8d1ab276-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "appetizer, main course", "keywords": "carrot, cheese, nacho, pinto beans, sweet potato, tomatillo, tomato, tortilla chips", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 440}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds ripe Roma tomatoes (about 5 or 6)", "1/2 pound tomatillos (about 3 or 4), husked and rinsed", "1 to 2 jalape\u00f1os, destemmed", "1 to 2 chiles de \u00e1rbol, destemmed", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro, leaves and upper stems, plus 1 cup reserved for garnish", "1/8 teaspoon ground cumin", "Kosher or sea salt", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "3 cups (1/2-inch) diced peeled carrot or sweet potato (or a combination)", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 cup finely chopped white onion, plus 1/2 cup reserved for garnish", "1 cup finely chopped celery", "1 1/2 cups cooked, drained pinto beans (from about 3/4 cup dried beans or a 15-ounce can)", "1 to 1 1/2 pounds store-bought or Homemade Tortilla Chips (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021579-homemade-tortilla-chips\">see recipe</a>)", "1 pound shredded cheese (any combination of Oaxaca, Monterey Jack and Cheddar)", "1 cup Mexican crema"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the salsa: Place the tomatoes, tomatillos, jalape\u00f1os, chiles de \u00e1rbol and garlic in a medium saucepan.
