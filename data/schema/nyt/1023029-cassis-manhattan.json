If you prefer to keep the drink to one type of whiskey, opt for rye and leave out the bourbon. The cocktail will be slightly more spice-forward and boozier in feel. Whatever you do, let the cherry garnish sit until the very end of the drink for an especially flavorful final snack.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/16/dining/11cassisrex-2/merlin_202736397_04efe236-9b88-4bc8-b63f-c23103ac28e0-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bourbon, creme de cassis, rye whiskey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 122}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice", "1 ounce rye whiskey", "1 ounce bourbon", "3/4 ounce sweet vermouth", "1/4 ounce cr\u00e8me de cassis", "3 to 4 dashes angostura bitters", "1 brandied or maraschino cherry, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a cocktail shaker or mixing glass filled with ice, combine the rye whiskey, bourbon, vermouth, cr\u00e8me de cassis and bitters.
