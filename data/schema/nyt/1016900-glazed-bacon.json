Her brown-sugar-glazed bacon represents the former, and she occasionally served it as an hors d\u2019oeuvre at her restaurant, which she started in her family\u2019s 1756 Pennsylvania Dutch farmhouse in Mount Joy in the late 1950s. The restaurant became a place of pilgrimage for food lovers, among them Craig Claiborne, who wrote an article about it in The New York Times in 1965. This recipe, which Ms. Groff said \u201cwill amaze every guest,\u201d serves six, but she noted that you can easily scale it up to serve 30, or possibly more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19PENNSYLVANIA/19PENNSYLVANIA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, bacon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 271}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 173, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "223 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound thick-cut bacon slices (about 6 slices)", "1/2 cup light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons red wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
