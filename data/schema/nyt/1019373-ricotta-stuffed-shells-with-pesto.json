{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ricotta-Stuffed Shells With Pesto", "description": "Classic stuffed and baked Italian-American jumbo shells are an easy sell. This summery version dispenses with the tomato sauce: The shells are instead drizzled lightly with olive oil, dusted with grated pecorino and bread crumbs, baked briefly until nicely browned, then napped with a bright green garlicky pesto sauce. The effect is more akin to crispy ravioli than a juicy, long-baked casserole. Serve 2 or 3 shells as a first course, 5 to 6 for a main.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/27/dining/27kitchrex/merlin_139481913_9caf8a67-39b0-410a-a330-36f7624d6d8f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, pastas", "keywords": "basil, giant pasta shells, pecorino, ricotta, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 316}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 706, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "524 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and pepper", "1 pound giant pasta shells made from semolina (500 grams on some imported brands), 36 to 40 pieces", "24 ounces fresh ricotta, about 2 1/2 cups", "2 eggs", "3 or 4 scallions, green and white parts, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley", "1/2 teaspoon finely chopped thyme, marjoram or rosemary", "Zest and juice of 1 small lemon", "Pinch of crushed red pepper", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan", "1/2 cup grated pecorino, plus 1/4 cup more for topping", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs", "2 cups basil leaves, rinsed and dried", "1 cup Italian parsley leaves, rinsed and dried", "1 or 2 finely grated garlic cloves", "Salt and pepper", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a large pot of well-salted water over high heat, and bring to a boil.
