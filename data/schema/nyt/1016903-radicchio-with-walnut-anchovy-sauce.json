{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Radicchio With Walnut Anchovy Sauce", "description": "I am tempted to call the sauce for this seared radicchio bagna cauda because that is what they called it in the London restaurant I used to frequent that inspired the recipe  (11 Park Walk, now closed). It is really more of a walnut-thickened anchovy vinaigrette, and it is perfect with the radicchio. When you cook radicchio some sweet flavors emerge, but bitter is still the prevailing taste. The salty anchovies, pungent garlic and nutty walnuts \u2013 which also have a bitterness all their own \u2013 go together beautifully. The sauce is substantial, and will thicken as it sits, so serve the dish right away if you are spooning it over the radicchio so it doesn\u2019t become stodgy; or serve the sauce in ramekins and dip the radicchio into it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/22/health/22bittersradicchio/22bittersradicchio-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 222, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "166 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 anchovy fillets", "7 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon walnut oil", "2 garlic cloves green germ removed, minced", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or sherry vinegar (more to taste)", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/3 cup / 1 1/2 ounces walnuts, finely chopped", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 large or 4 to 6 smaller radicchio, cut in wedges", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse anchovies briefly and chop.
