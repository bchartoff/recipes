{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Harvey House Candied Sweet Potatoes", "description": "When Fred Harvey opened his first Harvey House restaurant in 1876 on the railway line in Topeka, Kan., his idea was radical for the time: Railroad passengers would be fed good food in a pleasant environment by wholesome young women. His concept was so successful that it spawned 84 restaurants, a Hollywood movie and an official cookbook. And it was in \u201cThe Harvey House Cookbook\u201d that we found this excellent recipe for sweet potatoes candied with confectioners\u2019 sugar and butter. It is best served warm rather than piping hot, which makes it convenient for big meals like Thanksgiving. Bake it before you roast your turkey, then reheat it briefly just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19KANSAS/19KANSAS-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "side dish, sweet potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 553}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 204, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "88 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds sweet potatoes, scrubbed", "1/2 cup/1 stick butter", "1 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, boil sweet potatoes in their jackets in water to cover until fork-tender, 20 to 45 minutes depending upon their size.
