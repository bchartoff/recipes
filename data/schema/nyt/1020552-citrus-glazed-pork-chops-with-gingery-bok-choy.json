{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Citrus-Glazed Pork Chops With Gingery Bok Choy", "description": "Rich pork makes a perfect companion to tart oranges in this tasty weeknight meal. The bold, bright, citrusy sauce demands a robust cut of meat, so pick well-marbled, thick-cut pork chops with a nice fat cap. A dry rub of brown sugar creates a caramelized layer that lends depth to the pan sauce, and the gingery bok choy adds a delightful bit of freshness. This is quite a meal on its own, but you can steam some brown or white rice for a starchy side. Slice the pork to serve, and drizzle the pan sauce over everything.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/dining/yk-citrus-glazed-pork-chops/merlin_163287231_0d46e5b8-a979-40a2-82f3-a3d3e1275e77-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, meat", "keywords": "bok choy, brown sugar, ginger, orange, pork, rice vinegar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 311}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound large or baby bok choy", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed, plus more as needed", "3 (1 1/2-inch-thick) bone-in pork loin chops (about 2 1/2 pounds)", "1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar", "1 whole orange, cut in half crosswise, seeds removed, plus 3/4 cup fresh orange juice", "4 shallots, peeled and quartered", "4 garlic cloves, smashed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine the ginger and rice vinegar.
