{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dirty Rice", "description": "The name for this dish comes from how it looks, as the rice grains are speckled with bits of ground meat and seasonings. This version uses chicken livers instead of the common combination of both gizzards and livers to offer a distinct flavor profile. Dirty rice is similar to rice dressing, but it isn\u2019t relegated to just holiday tables. In fact, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a spread in Louisiana without it. A much beloved side dish, it\u2019s also worthy of being at the center of the plate as a hearty, rustic main dish. If you have leftover rice, you can skip the first two steps and adjust the seasonings to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/28/dining/VL-dirty-rice/merlin_144070578_080678bc-917d-457f-bcef-0e3bcfde656d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course, side dish", "keywords": "beef, chicken liver, rice, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 272}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup long-grain rice", "1 1/2 cups turkey or chicken stock, or water", "2 1/2 teaspoons Creole seasoning (see Tip), plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon unsalted or salted butter", "1/4 pound chicken livers", "1/2 pound ground beef (85 percent lean)", "1/2 pound ground pork", "2 tablespoons hot sauce", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "4 teaspoons canola, vegetable or extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 small green bell pepper, finely chopped", "2 celery stalks, thinly sliced", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallion greens", "1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the rice in a strainer under cold water until the water runs clear.
