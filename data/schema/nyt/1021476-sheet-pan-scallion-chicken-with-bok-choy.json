{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Scallion Chicken With Bok Choy", "description": "This weeknight sheet-pan chicken dinner makes exciting use of refrigerator staples. A fun mash-up of mustard, miso, scallions, garlic and ginger creates a zesty coating for skinless chicken thighs. The flavors soak into the chicken as it roasts, and the thighs are left on the bone to keep the meat juicy. The chicken cooks atop a bed of fresh bok choy, which picks up the rich aromatics of the pan juices, but broccoli florets also work well here. Turn leftovers into chicken salad sandwiches for lunch the next day: Simply pick the meat off the bones, chop the bok choy and mix it with some olive oil, lemon juice and chopped celery or fresh herbs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/06/dining/kc-sheet-pan-mustard-chicken/merlin_179685816_cedf8d24-993c-4cf8-8ebe-2951756ce27e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, one pot, poultry, roasts, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "bok choy, broccoli, chicken, chicken thigh, miso, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2625}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped (about 1/2 cup), plus more for garnish", "3 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger (from one 3-inch piece)", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 tablespoon white miso paste", "2 teaspoons turbinado or brown sugar", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup safflower or canola oil", "1 1/2 pounds baby bok choy, halved lengthwise, or large broccoli florets", "8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 pounds), skins removed", "Steamed rice or mashed potatoes, for serving", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
