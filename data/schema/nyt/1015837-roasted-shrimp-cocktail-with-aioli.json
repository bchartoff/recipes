{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Shrimp Cocktail With Aioli", "description": "Many renditions of shrimp cocktail are dull and bland, with over-boiled shrimp and cloying cocktail sauce. Not this one. The shrimp are roasted, which brings out their sweetness and allows them to absorb the seasonings and a little olive oil. Though traditionally made with garlic, this aioli replaces it with horseradish. And instead of cocktail sauce, they are paired with a horseradish-laced aioli seasoned with ketchup and hot sauce. If you like an even edgier sauce, feel free to increase the hot sauce and horseradish to taste. The sauce, which can be made up to 3 days ahead, is also terrific on roasted fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/18/dining/18JPAPPE5/18JPAPPE5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "appetizer, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 269}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 279, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "672 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large egg yolk", "1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, more as needed", "2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon prepared horseradish", "1 teaspoon hot sauce", "1 teaspoon ketchup", "2 pounds large shrimp, shelled and deveined"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolk, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.
