Tomato, ham and cream come together in this simple pasta sauce to form a comforting and easy weeknight meal. Cooked ham (as Italians call it, \u201cprosciutto cotto\u201d), is a hearty addition, as it provides texture and necessary salt. This recipe calls for deli ham, but you can substitute prosciutto or even pancetta if the mood strikes. An extra shower of Parmigiano before serving is a must for this filling meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Anna Francese Gass"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/dining/afg-penne-al-baffo/merlin_205954377_5eab5616-c7b4-4722-8a17-deb007ae85d1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "ham, pasta, tomato puree", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 774}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 shallot, minced", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "8 ounces sliced deli ham, cut into little squares\u00a0", "1 (28-ounce) can tomato passata (pur\u00e9e)", "1 pound penne", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
