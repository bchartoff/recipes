{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Lamb With Rosemary and Turnips", "description": "For a fragrant spring meal, choose the tenderest cut of lamb, the rack, and roast it over rosemary branches as done in this recipe. Roast two racks for guests with heartier appetites, but one really is enough for four servings. You\u2019ll want to use small, sweet new turnips here, no bigger than Ping-Pong balls. But if you can\u2019t find them, use the smallest turnips available or cut medium turnips into wedges. And if your turnips don\u2019t have their tops, substitute them with spinach, mizuna or other tender cooking greens.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/02/dining/02tanisrex2-lamb-2/merlin_202658685_68489bfb-c0eb-446f-9208-0f8cb05c6638-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 62}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (1\u00bd-pound) racks of lamb, trimmed of excess fat and frenched", "Salt and pepper", "4 tablespoons roughly chopped rosemary leaves, plus about 12 large sprigs", "12 ounces baby turnips, roots trimmed, halved or whole, washed but not peeled", "5 ounces turnip greens or other greens", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season lamb generously with salt and pepper.
