{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Updated No-Knead Bread", "description": "This recipe is based on <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread\">Jim Lahey\u2019s recipe</a> from 2006, with a few modifications for the sake of precision and a touch of acid to improve dough strength. Unlike Mr. Lahey\u2019s recipe, this one does not require handling a hot Dutch oven. You\u2019ll need one metal heatproof bowl (no rubberized bottoms) around 11 to 12 inches in diameter, a second bowl of any material around 8 to 9 inches in diameter, a scale with gram-accurate resolution, a baking sheet and a clean cotton dish towel. (Freshly washed is fine; it doesn\u2019t need to be brand new.) If you prefer, you can still bake in a Dutch oven instead of using the overturned bowl method described in the steps; see <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/dining/no-knead-bread-recipes.html\">this article on no-knead bread</a> for full details.

Dust a dish towel thoroughly on one side with rice flour or bread flour, then line the medium bowl with the towel, floured-side up. Generously flour your work surface.

Repeat three more times until each side of the dough has been folded over the top. Using the sides of your hands instead of your fingertips and as much extra flour as necessary to prevent sticking, flip the dough over.

When dough is ready, invert the bowl and baking sheet so that the dough is lying on the sheet. (The sheet will end up inverted.) Lift off the bowl and carefully lift off the kitchen towel. If it sticks at all, be very gentle when coaxing the dough off; the goal is to minimize the loss of gases trapped inside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake the bread: Splash some water inside the larger metal bowl, then invert it onto the baking sheet over the dough. Transfer the whole thing to the oven, reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees, and bake for 25 minutes. Using oven mitts or dry kitchen towels, remove the bowl and continue baking until the loaf is as dark as you\u2019d like it, 15 to 25 minutes longer.
