{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saut\u00e9ed Scallops", "description": "Sea scallops and bay scallops differ in size and sweetness. They also cook a little differently. I love a good hard sear on a sea scallop, a little crust, and a splash of wine in the butter at the end to provide a silky acidity against the sweet of the meat. For the tiny, sweet bay scallop, though, I prefer a gentle butter bath. Whichever you cook, be very careful not to overcook. Indeed, there is almost no such thing as an undercooked scallop.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/24/magazine/24mag-recipecard1-scallops/24mag-recipecard1-scallops-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "butter, scallops, white vermouth, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 582}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 158, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "446 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 pound sea scallops, patted dry", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1 tablespoon dry white vermouth or white wine", "1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large saut\u00e9 pan or skillet over medium-high heat, and add to it 3 tablespoons of the butter.
