{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Spoon Cake", "description": "This unfussy cake with a top layer of jammy strawberries is so gooey it\u2019s best to serve the whole thing with a spoon. The batter comes together quickly with minimal effort, using basic pantry ingredients and a small handful of berries \u2014 frozen or fresh. If you\u2019re using frozen, be sure to defrost them in the microwave first. Extract as much juice as possible from the fruit by macerating and mashing it, so that it lends the cake additional moisture while baking. Add a dash of freshly ground cardamom or ground ginger on top before baking it off, if you like, or some ribbons of fresh basil once it\u2019s hot out of the oven. Whatever embellishments you decide on, burrowing warm spoonfuls of this cake beside scoops of vanilla ice cream is the most important thing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/21/dining/17Spoonbread-a/merlin_173457813_169dbb65-34b9-4198-9515-c7c0f3e83c16-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "fourth of july, kwanzaa, labor day, memorial day, spring, summer, strawberry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 7697}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted, plus more for greasing", "5 ounces/145 grams frozen and thawed or fresh, hulled strawberries (about 1 cup)", "2/3 cup/150 grams packed light brown sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk, at room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "Vanilla ice cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and grease an 8-inch (square or round) baking dish with butter.
