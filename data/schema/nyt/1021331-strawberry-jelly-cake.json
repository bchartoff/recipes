{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Jelly Cake", "description": "This layer cake is affectionately referred to as \u201cGrandma\u2019s Cake\u201d by many Southerners. Using jelly as the filling and the frosting is a wonderful way to add fruity flavor to a cake year-round. The jelly seeps into the cake, so there\u2019s no need to brush on a simple syrup to keep it moist. This recipe uses cake flour, which has less protein than all-purpose flour and yields a more tender crumb. But it can be prone to clumping. Sift it into the mixing bowl, or use a whisk to aerate it and break up any lumps. \u201cFrost\u201d the sides of the cake with jelly or buttercream, or just let it drip down the sides. When making this cake in the summer, you can top it with sliced fresh strawberries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/dining/vl-jellycake/merlin_176001741_738206e5-b32f-429b-86d6-1114d6ee87ed-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "birthday, cake flour, jelly, milk, strawberries", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 295}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick baking spray", "3 cups/385 grams cake flour, plus more for flouring the pan", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk (or nondairy milk)", "2 cups/480 grams strawberry jelly", "1 cup/165 grams sliced fresh strawberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
