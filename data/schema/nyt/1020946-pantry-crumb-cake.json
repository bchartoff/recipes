{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pantry Crumb Cake", "description": "More of a snack or breakfast than a showy dessert, a homey crumb cake doesn\u2019t need the oohs-and-aahs of any guests. It\u2019s the kind of thing a small family can devour in a few days, and a single person can freeze in slices, at the ready whenever the urge for brown sugar and butter hits. (Just wrap each slice up separately and store them in a container in the freezer; a slice will thaw in under an hour on the counter.) This cake is also extremely adaptable: Use whatever spices you like. If you don\u2019t have oats, use more flour or chopped nuts. And feel free to use whatever fruit, fresh, frozen and thawed, or canned, you have on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/25/dining/23mc-pantryrex1/merlin_170847798_c70c5835-03fd-4adc-9421-e65410804a47-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 (8- or 9-inch) round or square cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack, cakes", "keywords": "dessert, fruit, oats, spices", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 895}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/110 grams packed light or dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted", "1/4 cup/30 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/20 grams old-fashioned oats", "1 teaspoon ground spices (cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg or a combination)", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters sour cream, yogurt or nondairy yogurt, buttermilk, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or milk acidified with 1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest (optional)", "1/2 cup fresh, frozen and thawed, or canned fruit, such as blueberries, raspberries, cherries, grated apple or pear, chopped pineapple (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
