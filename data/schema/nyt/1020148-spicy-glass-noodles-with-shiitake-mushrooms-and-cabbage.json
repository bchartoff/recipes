Also known as bean thread noodles or cellophane noodles, gluten-free glass noodles are often combined with vegetables and used as a filling for dumplings or spring rolls, or added to soups, braised dishes or stir-fries for heft. Here, the transparent threads are tossed with curry-spiced Napa cabbage and dried shiitake mushrooms, which have more complex, earthy notes than fresh. Bright cilantro and ginger round out the dish, which is equally good warm or at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Corinne Trang"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/02/dining/ct-cellophane-noodles/ct-cellophane-noodles-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "noodles, vegetables", "keywords": "cilantro, curry powder, ginger, glass noodles, napa cabbage, shiitake, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 72}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 bundles dried glass noodles (about 5 ounces)", "8 dried shiitake mushrooms\u00a0(about 1/2 ounce)", "3 tablespoons grapeseed oil", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and julienned", "1 scallion, trimmed and finely chopped", "1 pound Napa or green cabbage (about 1/3 medium cabbage), cored and thinly sliced into 1/4-inch-wide strips", "1 teaspoon Indian or Vietnamese curry powder", "4 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "3 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves and stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the noodles in a large bowl, cover with room-temperature water and soak until pliable, about 30 minutes.
