Hot, smoky garlic bread is equally friendly to a juicy steak, a whole fish or a Caprese salad. Any loaf that is not too thick can be used, but whole grain stands up better to the oil-garlic-fire treatment. You may doubt that using garlic cloves with the papery skins on will work, but the rough surface of the toasted bread rubs them right off.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20SALAD4/20SALAD4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, breads", "keywords": "baguette, garlic, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 190}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 135, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "244 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large (or 2 small loaves) baguette or ciabatta bread, preferably whole grain", "Olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, not peeled", "1 large ripe tomato, halved (optional)", "Coarse salt such as kosher or Maldon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut bread in half lengthwise, and cut in half crosswise if very long.
