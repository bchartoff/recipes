{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Bars With Olive Oil and Sea Salt", "description": "Traditional lemon bars balance the tangy sweetness of lemon curd with a rich shortbread crust. This recipe adds extra notes of flavor to the mix: the compelling bitterness of good olive oil and a touch of sea salt sprinkled on top. They lend a mild savory character to this childhood favorite, making it a little more sophisticated than the usual lemon bar, but just as compelling. Choose an olive oil with personality, otherwise you\u2019ll miss the point. Something herbal and fresh tasting with peppery notes works best. Although the bars will last up to five days when stored in the fridge, they have the brightest flavor when eaten within 24 hours of baking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/14/multimedia/olive-oil-bars-clark/olive-oil-bars-clark-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "24 bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2598}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "44 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/155 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons/25 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "10 tablespoons/142 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "4 to 6 lemons", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams sugar", "2 large eggs plus 3 yolks", "1 1/2 teaspoons/5 grams cornstarch", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "4 tablespoons/57 grams butter", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters fruity extra-virgin olive oil", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees and line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with enough parchment to hang over two of the sides (to be used as handles later to lift the bars out of the pan)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the shortbread base, pulse together the flour, granulated sugar, confectioners\u2019 sugar, lemon zest and salt in a food processor, or whisk together in a large bowl.
