{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Angel Food Cake With Preserved Lemon Curd", "description": "Adding preserved lemon juice to lemon curd is the brilliant brainchild of Samantha Kincaid, the pastry chef of the restaurant High Street on Hudson. It adds a complex brininess to what can be an overly sweet citrus custard. In this recipe, the curd is lightened with a little whipped cream and used to frost and fill a lemon-flavored angel food cake. It\u2019s a stunning dessert that\u2019s bright, rich and light all at once.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/16/dining/lemon-curd-angel-food-cake/lemon-curd-angel-food-cake-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, egg whites, lemon, preserved lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 520}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 418, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "228 milligrams", "sugarContent": "49 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/110 grams cake flour", "1 1/3 cups/265 grams granulated sugar", "12 large egg whites", "Pinch kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar", "1/2 cup/62 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon lemon extract", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters lemon juice", "1 1/2 teaspoons powdered gelatin", "6 large eggs", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters preserved lemon juice (strained off from a batch of salt preserved lemons, either store-bought or homemade)", "Finely grated zest of two lemons", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/236 milliliters heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees and place a rack in the center."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sift flour and 1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar into a large bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine egg whites, salt and cream of tartar and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Gradually add in remaining 1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until firm, glossy peaks form.
