Drain and add to the skillet with the fennel mixture along with about a cup of the pasta water. Scatter in the lemon zest. Heat on low. Use tongs to toss pasta thoroughly with the fennel mixture. There should be enough liquid to moisten the pasta without making it soupy, so add more pasta water if needed. Correct seasoning with salt and pepper. Don\u2019t be shy with the pepper. Divide the pasta among 4 to 6 warm plates, top each with some of the bread crumbs and serve with cheese on the side.
