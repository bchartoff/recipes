I have cut the amount of olive oil to 1/4 cup from 1/2.  Some of America\u2019s biggest food service companies are committed to increasing vegetable consumption, but they don\u2019t want to lose their meat-loving customers, so they are figuring out ways to create dishes with less meat that are still appealing. You may face this challenge in your own family; you want everybody to cut down on meat consumption, but they love their burgers. Mr. Samuel has developed a savory roasted mushroom base that he mixes with hamburger meat for a delicious burger. It looked, smelled, acted and tasted like a burger (well, a very vegetal burger), and it had the added quality of being very moist. Everybody gave it high marks in a taste test, and I made a mental note to make the base at home and use it in burgers, meatballs and more.
