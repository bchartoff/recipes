{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cauliflower Chaat for One", "description": "This recipe for a single portion of cauliflower chaat comes from the chef Anita Lo. It gets its flavor from store-bought chaat masala, a South Asian seasoning tangy with dried mango and black salt. The recipe doubles easily, but if you\u2019re cooking for one, pick a small head of cauliflower and use about half of it. Use the rest to make pickled cauliflower, or saut\u00e9 it in the same way and then take the seasoning in a different direction.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/dining/03lorex/merlin_144222501_b30cbebb-0e95-407b-880c-722ebc8f21d2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "for one, vegetables", "keywords": "cauliflower, chaat masala, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 177}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 505, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "618 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1/2 small head cauliflower, cut into florets", "Salt to taste", "2 teaspoons finely chopped ginger", "2 teaspoons finely chopped jalape\u00f1o pepper", "1 tablespoon chopped cilantro", "1/2 teaspoon lemon juice", "2 teaspoons chaat masala", "1 cup cilantro", "1/2 jalape\u00f1o pepper", "1/4 small white onion", "1/2 small garlic clove", "1 tablespoons plain, full-fat Greek yogurt", "Pinch of cumin", "1 teaspoon lemon juice", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped roasted almonds", "Cooked rice or store-bought flatbread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the cauliflower: Heat the oil in a saut\u00e9 pan on high heat, until the oil starts to smoke in\u00a0small wisps.
