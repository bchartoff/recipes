{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chickpea Salad Sandwich", "description": "This quick recipe makes simple canned chickpeas into a bold and hearty vegetarian meal. Chickpeas are mashed in a creamy, rich lemon-tahini dressing, then mixed with crunchy celery and scallions for fresh bite. Earthy alfalfa sprouts, crisp lettuce, creamy avocado and sweet tomatoes bring contrasting textures and flavors to the sandwich. The chickpea salad can be made a few hours ahead and kept refrigerated. Any leftover salad makes a tasty dip served with tortilla chips or crackers. For a vegan alternative, omit the cheese for sandwiches that still boast layers of flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/kc-chickpea-salad-sandwich/kc-chickpea-salad-sandwich-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, quick, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "chickpea, tahini, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1603}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "6 tablespoons tahini", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon grated garlic\u00a0", "Kosher salt and pepper", "2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained", "1/2 cup finely chopped celery", "1/2 cup finely chopped scallions", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano", "8 slices multigrain sandwich bread\u00a0", "Mayonnaise, as needed", "8 butter lettuce leaves", "1 (packed) cup alfalfa sprouts\u00a0", "1 avocado, thinly sliced", "1 large tomato, thinly sliced\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine oil, tahini, lemon juice and garlic.
