{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Mint Tart", "description": "This chocolate mint tart is wonderfully reminiscent of a giant, elegant peppermint patty, tucked into a chocolate pastry shell. The mint flavor is subtle thanks to fresh-mint infused cream that is used both in the white chocolate ganache filling and billowy topping. But don\u2019t worry, dark-chocolate lovers: There is plenty here for you, too. The crisp crust is spiked with Dutch-processed cocoa and the middle layer is deep, dark bittersweet chocolate ganache. It\u2019s also very rich; a thin slice alongside a cup of coffee is the perfect after-dinner mint. This recipe has multiple chilling steps, so plan ahead if you're going to make it. It's more of an afternoon project, than a simple weeknight endeavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/18/dining/18COOKING-CHOCOLATE-MINT-TART/18COOKING-CHOCOLATE-MINT-TART-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch tart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 49}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/62 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/4 cup/24 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cold and cut into cubes", "1 egg yolk\u00a0", "1 3/4 cups heavy cream", "1 cup/15 grams fresh mint leaves, packed", "10 3/8 ounces/297 grams white chocolate, chopped", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract (optional)", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "3 1/2 ounces/99 grams bittersweet chocolate, chopped", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1 cup reserved mint-infused cream", "2 teaspoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, confectioners\u2019 sugar, cocoa powder and salt.
