{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oysters Rockefeller", "description": "In this classic recipe, the Rockefeller name refers to the dollar bill-green color of the sauce \u2014 and its richness, as it\u2019s loaded with butter, garlic, spinach and herbs.\u00a0You can make the butter sauce up to three days ahead and store it in the refrigerator, then drop dollops of it on shucked oysters just before broiling. Watch the oysters carefully as they broil. You want the bread crumbs in the topping to turn golden and the oysters to warm up slightly but not cook through. Serve these with forks on the side; all the hot, buttery sauce makes them too slick for slurping.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/22/dining/17oystersrex3-rockefeller/merlin_199179768_44235f13-0c98-406d-8dd5-1668f86601fd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings (24 oysters)", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "seafood, appetizer", "keywords": "oyster, panko, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 153}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "1 cup finely chopped baby spinach", "1 cup finely chopped parsley, leaves and tender stems", "1 large shallot, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated, passed through a press or minced", "Pinch of fine sea salt or table salt", "1 lemon", "Coarse, rock or kosher salt, or crumbled-up foil, for the pan (to stabilize the oysters)", "24 oysters, shucked"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter.
