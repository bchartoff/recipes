This recipe, which nixes the traditional cream cheese for a blend of salty Parmesan and heavy cream, is prepared on the stovetop and requires only 10 minutes of active cooking before it\u2019s slid into the oven. As with any baked pasta, the key is to cook the shells until pointedly shy of al dente and to toss them with a sauce that seems excessively wet, as the pasta will tenderize and the sauce will thicken in the oven. These ingredients skew classic, but there is infinite room to riff: Swap in chopped kale or mustard greens in place of the spinach, experiment with cheese combinations, stir in mustard or caramelized onions or top with crumbled bacon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Aaron Hutcherson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/06/dining/ah-spinach-artichoke-pasta/merlin_151074951_6612441a-3235-490b-a684-192724bb91ae-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, casseroles, pastas", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, mozzarella, parmesan, pasta, spinach, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1096}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 630, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "638 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "8 ounces medium pasta shells", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "10 ounces fresh baby spinach, or frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and drained", "1 (14-ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and roughly chopped", "2 cups heavy cream (1 pint)", "4 ounces grated Parmesan (about 1 cup)", "Black pepper", "4 ounces grated mozzarella (about 1 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
