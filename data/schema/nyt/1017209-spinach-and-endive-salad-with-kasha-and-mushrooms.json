I love pairing this nutty grain with both cooked and raw spinach, and with walnuts and walnut oil. Kasha also goes well with foods that have a bitter edge, like endive, so I included some in the salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/07/science/recipehealthendive/recipehealthendive-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, spring, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 16}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 240, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "257 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 6-ounce bag baby spinach, washed and spun dry", "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017205-kasha\">1 cup cooked kasha</a>", "4 to 6 white or cremini mushrooms (to taste and depending on size), sliced thin", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, or a combination of dill, parsley, and chives", "2 endives, sliced", "1/3 cup broken walnuts", "1 ounce crumbled feta (optional)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "freshly ground pepper to taste", "Salt to taste", "1 small garlic clove, pureed", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons walnut oil", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large salad bowl, toss together spinach kasha, mushrooms, fresh herbs, endives, walnuts and feta."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl or measuring cup whisk together lemon juice, vinegar, salt, pepper, Dijon mustard, garlic, walnut oil and olive oil.
