{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Peanut and Pumpkin Soup", "description": "This recipe is a promise of warmth on those cool autumn nights. Habanero chiles and peanuts both feature heavily in Nigerian cuisine, and this soup is an adaptation of a long-simmered stew common to much of West Africa. Don\u2019t be afraid of a chile with seeds: The fragrant oils from these peppers are worth every bite. The peanut butter and coconut milk mellow the warmth of the chile to a gentle, lingering heat, but you can also the chile out before the soup is pur\u00e9ed. An optional spoon of honey to the soup will round out the flavors, and a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or yogurt will further temper the heat. Serve with a baguette or sourdough bread for dipping.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/15/dining/yk-peanut-and-pumpkin-soup/yk-peanut-and-pumpkin-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, chile, coconut milk, peanut butter, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 396}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 477, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "1115 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium onion, peeled and diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "4 garlic cloves, smashed", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and chopped", "1/2 habanero or bird's eye chile", "1 (14-ounce) can pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "3 cups water or chicken or vegetable stock", "1 (13-ounce) can coconut milk", "1 tablespoon agave or honey (optional)", "1/4 cup unsweetened natural peanut butter", "Salt", "2 tablespoons sliced fresh chives", "1/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or yogurt<strong>\u00a0</strong>(optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large stock pot, heat oil over medium heat.
