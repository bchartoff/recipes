{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mezcal Royale Punch", "description": "This bright, thoroughly modern combination of lime, blanc vermouth, mezcal and Cognac is topped, in a nod to classic Champagne punches, with sparkling red wine. If you don\u2019t have sparkling red, opt for a dry Lambrusco, sparkling ros\u00e9 or even a sparkling white. Using a sparkling white eliminates the festive color but keeps the effervescence. When choosing glasses or tea cups or ceramics to serve punch, be sure to err on the smaller side. Punch should be served in smaller portions \u2014 and refilled often.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/07/dining/01punchrex2-mezcal/merlin_216830937_c09a19c4-0f39-446a-8cbb-44e63a9e6e72-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "18 to 20 (4-ounce) drinks", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails, punches", "keywords": "brandy, cognac, lime, mezcal, party, plan-ahead, sparkling wine, vermouth, christmas, hanukkah, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 73}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 limes", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "1 1/2 cups/12 ounces blanc vermouth", "3/4 cup/6 ounces mezcal", "3/4 cup/6 ounces Cognac or brandy", "3 cups/24 ounces club soda", "1 (750-milliliter) bottle cold, dry sparkling red wine, Lambrusco or sparkling ros\u00e9"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel 4 limes and place the peels in a medium bowl (if using a muddler) or a medium jar (if using the end of a rolling pin to muddle); reserve the limes.
