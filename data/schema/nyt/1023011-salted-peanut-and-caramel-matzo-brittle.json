For those with peanut allergies \u2014 or those who do not eat peanuts at Passover \u2014 you can substitute any creamy nut butter and nuts. You can also use tahini and halvah; add snipped, dried apricots or dried cranberries for color; or keep it simple and stick with chocolate \u2014 preferably dark, to counter the caramel\u2019s sweetness \u2014 as in the original recipe by baker Marcy Goldman in her book \u201cA Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking\u201d (Doubleday 1998).
