{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oden With Homemade Shrimp Balls", "description": "Oden is a comforting Japanese one-pot dish in which assorted fish cakes, vegetables, fried tofu and hard-boiled eggs are simmered in a dashi broth. Hondashi, bonito soup stock made from dried bonito and flavors of kombu, is a convenient pantry item that creates instant dashi. Homemade shrimp balls with fragrant ginger, garlic and scallions replace store-bought fish cakes in this version. As they poach alongside earthy mushrooms and daikon, the soup becomes fortified with deep seafood flavor. Inari-no-moto, found canned in most Asian markets, is deep-fried tofu that has been cooked in dashi, soy sauce and mirin until it softens and absorbs the sauce. The tofu adds texture and another layer of seasoning, but the hot pot is just as tasty without. Add udon noodles for a heartier meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/19/dining/kc-oden/kc-oden-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "cabbage, daikon, egg, noodles, shiitake, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 161}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large eggs", "2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced", "1 pound daikon, peeled and cut into 1-inch slices or pieces", "12 ounces napa cabbage (about 1/2 small head), chopped into 2-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons instant dashi powder", "1 pound cleaned, tail-off medium shrimp, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons chopped scallions", "2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "4 ounces inari-no-moto (seasoned tofu skins), sliced 1-inch thick", "1 pound cooked udon noodles (8 ounces dry), optional", "Hot mustard, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, arrange eggs in a single layer and add enough water to cover by 1 inch.
