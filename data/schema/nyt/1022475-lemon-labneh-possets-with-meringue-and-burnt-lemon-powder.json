{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon-Labneh Possets With Meringue and Burnt Lemon Powder", "description": "\u201cSimple ingredients made super special\u201d could not be more true of these lemon possets, which are well worth the effort for their perfect combination of creamy, tart, sweet and crispy. A posset is a quintessential British dessert and has a similar consistency to that of a custard or pudding, but acid (lemon juice in this case) is used to set the base as opposed to egg yolks or cornstarch. There are a number of shortcuts you could take, including using store-bought labneh or replacing it with an equal amount of thick-set cr\u00e9me fra\u00eeche. You can also use store-bought meringues, crushing them lightly to sprinkle on top. The burnt lemon powder is an added bonus and a great way to use up lemon peel that you may have otherwise discarded. You can use this powder in a number of inventive ways, including sprinkling it over hummus or some roasted vegetables for added depth. If you are making your own labneh, be sure to start the day before.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/25/dining/20Ottorex/merlin_193269204_1ecca0c5-d342-4420-9eb8-75b5c2ce22ae-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 possets", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "cream of tartar, egg whites, heavy cream, labneh, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 210}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/450 grams Greek yogurt", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 1 to 2 lemons)", "3/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons/200 grams lemon juice (from about 4 to 5 lemons)", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "2 3/4 cups/650 grams heavy cream (double cream)", "7 ounces/200 grams labneh (homemade or store-bought)", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/115 grams granulated sugar", "2 egg whites (65 grams), from 2 large eggs", "1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar", "2 unwaxed (or well-scrubbed) lemons"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the labneh: Add yogurt and salt to a bowl and mix well to combine.
