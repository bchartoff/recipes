{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wild Rice and Quinoa Stuffing", "description": "Call this savory mix of wild rice, quinoa, mushrooms, walnuts and greens a stuffing or a pilaf. It\u2019s not meant to go inside a turkey but it's imbued with the definitive flavors of Thanksgiving. Kale or chard add some color; if you\u2019re trying to find a place for greens at the table but don\u2019t want to deal with massive amounts to stem and cook for a crowd, this is a great place for them. The result is substantial, and will satisfy everybody at the table \u2013 vegetarians and vegans, and those who avoid gluten. If you're feeding omnivores and wish to add even more flavor, crumble browned Italian sausage into the pan alongside the grains and greens.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/dining/21COOKING-QUINOASTUFFING/21COOKING-QUINOASTUFFING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, kale, mushroom, quinoa, swiss chard, wild rice, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 120}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 251, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "357 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce (about 1 cup) dried porcini mushrooms", "1 1/2 cups wild rice", "Salt to taste", "1/2 cup quinoa", "1/2 pound kale or Swiss chard leaves, washed and coarsely chopped (you should have about 8 cups leaves; no need to chop if using bagged greens)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for greasing baking dish", "3 or 4 shallots, finely chopped (about 3/4 cup)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 cup chopped celery", "1 pound fresh cremini or wild mushrooms, trimmed and quartered", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried thyme", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage", "Black pepper, to taste", "1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts", "1 tablespoon walnut oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place dried porcinis in a bowl and cover with 2 quarts boiling water.
