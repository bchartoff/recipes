It\u2019s also a cheesecake you can customize. You can make the cake milder or tangier by using all heavy cream or all sour cream, or a combination of the two. You can add fruits or nuts, swirls of chocolate or drops of extract.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Weinstein"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/01/dining/01COOKING_CHEESECAKE1/01COOKING_CHEESECAKE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H30M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cheese, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 190}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 378, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "276 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs", "3 tablespoons sugar", "Pinch of salt", "1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted", "2 pounds (four 8-ounce boxes) cream cheese, at room temperature", "1 1/3 cups sugar", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/3 cups sour cream or heavy cream, or a combination of the two"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the crust: Butter a 9-inch springform pan \u2014 choose one that has sides that are 2 3/4 inches high (if the sides are lower, you will have cheesecake batter left over) \u2014 and wrap the bottom of the pan in a double layer of aluminum foil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir the crumbs, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl.
