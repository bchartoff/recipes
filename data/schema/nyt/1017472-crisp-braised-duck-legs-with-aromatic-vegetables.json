You brown the duck until the skin is crackly and golden. You cook the vegetables in some of the rendered fat until they start to soften, then you add chicken stock and cook everything together in the oven until the duck is tender and super-crisp and the vegetables are melting and unctuous. Do not feel bound to the carrots, celery and onion called for in the recipe. Any number of root vegetables \u2013 infused with the rendered fat \u2013 would be incredible here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/21/dining/video-braisedduck/video-braisedduck-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "carrot, celery, chicken stock, duck leg, onion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 258}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 589, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "46 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1123 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 duck legs, trimmed of excess fat", "Salt and pepper to taste", "2 large onion", "1 pound carrots", "6 celery stalks", "2 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put duck legs, skin side down, in a skillet large enough to accommodate all ingredients comfortably; turn heat to medium.
