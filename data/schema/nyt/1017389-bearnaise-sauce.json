{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "B\u00e9arnaise Sauce", "description": "B\u00e9arnaise sauce is a piquant child of hollandaise, one of the so-called mother sauces of French cuisine. It is simply an emulsification \u2014 egg yolks and butter cut through with vinegar flavored with tarragon and shallots, with a bite of black pepper. Think of it as a loose mayonnaise, requiring only plenty of whisking and a careful hand with the heat to master. You don\u2019t need the clarified butter many recipes call for \u2014 a good unsalted butter, melted, works just fine. Apply the sauce to steaks or burgers, asparagus or salmon. The sauce\u2019s richness improves virtually everything it touches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/10/magazine/10eat/10mag-10eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "egg yolks, shallot, white wine vinegar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 325}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 340, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "175 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup white-wine vinegar", "1 small shallot, peeled and minced", "1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon chopped tarragon leaves", "2 egg yolks", "12 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Splash of lemon juice, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the vinegar, shallots, black pepper and 1 tablespoon of tarragon leaves into a small saucepan, and set over a medium flame.
