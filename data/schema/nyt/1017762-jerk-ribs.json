{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jerk Ribs", "description": "Harold Dieterle, the chef and an owner of two restaurants in Manhattan, Perilla and Kin Shop, cooks food that is often fiery and always immensely detailed. It resembles intricate music that is played very, very loud. This Jamaican-style jerk sauce is no exception. Its heat is towering, but it does not overwhelm the flavors that accompany the flames: thyme and allspice, along with wisps of caramelized sugar and a scent of rum. \u201cYou could serve it on chicken,\u201d Dieterle told me. \u201cIt\u2019s insane on ribs.\u201d Not to mention pork tenderloin and bluefish. Jerk tofu? That\u2019d be terrific as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/25/magazine/25eat1/25mag-25eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "allspice, haba\u00f1ero, ribs, thyme", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 341}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium-size bunch of scallions, trimmed and roughly chopped", "1/2 small yellow onion, peeled and roughly chopped", "4 cloves garlic, peeled", "4 habanero peppers, stemmed and seeded", "1 serrano pepper, stemmed and seeded", "Kosher salt to taste", "2 tablespoons dried thyme", "1 tablespoon garlic powder", "2 tablespoons ground allspice", "1 teaspoon chipotle powder or habanero powder", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon chile powder", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon smoked Spanish paprika", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup dark rum", "2 racks baby back ribs", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300.
