{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Lasagna With Bolognese Sauce and Bechamel", "description": "No doubt about it, this lasagna is a project, but if you\u2019ve never made fresh pasta, here\u2019s an excellent place to start. Using fresh pasta in lasagna transforms it into another dish altogether: instead of falling off the fork into a slippery mass of naked noodles and separate sauce, it holds together beautifully. The sauce cooks into and holds fast to the toothsome pasta, making it stick together like layer cake. The kale flavor in the pasta is faint (you can leave it out) but adds another breath of green to the aromatic fresh basil and crisp fried sage.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/16/dining/16SUPERMODEL_LASAGNE/16SUPERMODEL_LASAGNE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "bechamel, lasagna, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 220}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds ground beef", "1 cup finely diced celery", "1 cup finely diced carrots", "1 cup finely diced onions", "1 cup white wine", "1 quart whole or 2 percent milk", "1 quart (4 cups) low-salt beef stock, or a combination of beef and chicken", "8 ounces (3/4 cup) tomato paste", "Salt and black pepper", "2 dried bay leaves", "6 fresh sage leaves", "2 ounces (1/2 stick) butter", "1 ounce (1/4 cup) cake or all-purpose flour", "3 cups whole milk", "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg", "Salt and black or white pepper", "6 ounces kale leaves (optional)", "1 pound pasta flour or all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling", "4 eggs", "1 tablespoon salt", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Olive oil, for frying", "1 cup fresh sage leaves, loosely packed", "12 to 16 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese", "1 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced", "2 cups fresh basil leaves, loosely packed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the meat sauce:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large heavy pot over high heat.
