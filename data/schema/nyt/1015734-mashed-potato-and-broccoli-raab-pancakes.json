Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and when it is hot carefully scoop up heaped tablespoons of the potato mixture and use a spoon or spatula to ease them out of the spoon into the pan. Gently flatten the mounds slightly with the back of a spoon or a spatula but don\u2019t worry if this is hard to do \u2013 if they stick -- because when you flip them over you can flatten them into pancakes. Brown on the first side \u2013 about 2 or 3 minutes \u2013 and using a spatula, flip the potato and broccoli raab mounds over and gently push them down so that they will be shaped like pancakes. Brown on the other side and remove to a baking sheet. Continue with the remaining potato mixture, adding oil to the pan as necessary."}]}
