Like the stir-fry, this tomato soup is on the sweet side, with sharpness from the untraditional addition of ketchup. There are several ways to drop an egg: Beating the eggs lightly will result in both white and yellow swirls, while running a chopstick or wooden spoon through the egg as it cooks will produce long, willowy strands. This recipe calls for dropping the egg into the hot soup and leaving it, which will give you chunks. A tip: If you have a liquid measuring cup with a spout, beat the egg in that, as it will give you more control when pouring the egg into the hot liquid. If you want the soup spicy, top with chile oil or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022366-chile-crisp\">chile crisp</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/11/dining/hm-tomato-egg-drop-soup/merlin_204847800_46b0805f-07e1-4106-9191-7e050945f0e2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weeknight, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "egg, tofu, tomato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 398}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon neutral oil", "4 scallions, white and green parts separated, finely sliced", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "3 cups vegetable stock", "1 (14-ounce) package firm tofu, drained, patted dry and cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons ketchup", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 tablespoons granulated or brown sugar", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "3 large eggs, well beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
