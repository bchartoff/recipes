{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Crab Linguine with Mustard, Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and Herbs", "description": "This pasta dish is impressive, but it is barely any work at all, ideal for an impromptu gathering. The sauce is just warm cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, highly seasoned, along with a shower of herbs, and just enough green chile to cut the richness. (If you don\u2019t want chile, increase the mustard and black pepper, and add lime zest.) Obviously, you\u2019ll want the freshest sweetest crabmeat available. Substitute lobster if you can\u2019t get crab, or use small shrimp, briefly cooked in butter, and feel free to vary the herbs \u2014 basil, mint, dill or chervil would be most welcome.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/17/dining/recipes-crabpasta/recipes-crabpasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, pastas", "keywords": "crab, mustard, pasta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 206}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 428, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "533 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound linguine", "Salt and pepper", "1 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "3 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "Pinch of cayenne", "1 pound cooked crab meat, lump if possible", "1 serrano or jalape\u00f1o chile, seeds removed and finely chopped, or less to taste", "2 tablespoons finely cut chives", "6 scallions, thinly sliced on an angle", "1 tablespoon tarragon leaves, roughly chopped", "Cilantro sprigs, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a large pot of water on to boil.
