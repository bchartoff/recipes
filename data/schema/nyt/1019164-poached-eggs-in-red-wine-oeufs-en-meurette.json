{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Poached Eggs in Red Wine (Oeufs en Meurette)", "description": "Oeufs en meurette is a classic French dish of poached eggs covered in a rich red wine sauce filled with lardons, mushrooms and onion. When the writer Michael Harlan Turkell was working on his book \u201cAcid Trip: Travels in the World of Vinegar,\u201d he picked up a tip from the French chef Bertrand Auboyneau of Bistrot Paul Bert in Paris. A generous amount of red wine vinegar, added to the sauce, lightens and brightens the dish, all the while emphasizing the flavors of red wine. Use the best-tasting vinegar you can get your hands on, since there's enough of it here to really redirect the taste of the sauce. To turn the recipe into a full, hearty meal, just poach two eggs for each person, instead of one, and add a side of simply dressed salad greens.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/07/dining/07VinegarRex1/07VinegarRex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 Servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "bacon, eggs, mushrooms, red wine, vinegar, high protein, low-carb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 32}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 568, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "915 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 thick slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips (lardons)", "10 to 12 pearl onions, peeled and trimmed", "6 ounces button mushrooms, trimmed and thickly sliced", "1 clove garlic, crushed", "3 cups red wine, such as a Burgundy", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup good quality red wine vinegar", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "4 slices white bread", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "4 eggs", "2 sprigs parsley, leaves chopped, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the bacon to a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally until it\u2019s cooked through and browning slightly at the edges, about 6 minutes.
