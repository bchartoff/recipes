{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaghetti al Limone With Shrimp", "description": "There are many interpretations of the classic Italian pasta dish, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018692-spaghetti-al-limone\">spaghetti al limone</a>, or spaghetti with lemon. Some call for an Alfredo-like sauce made with heavy cream, butter and Parmesan, while others rely on just olive oil, lemon juice, Parmesan and starchy pasta water. This particular recipe, which adds saut\u00e9ed shrimp, white wine and fresh tarragon to the mix, leans toward the simpler preparation. Without the addition of heavy cream, the sauce has a brighter lemon flavor, which works beautifully with the delicate brininess of the shrimp. Tarragon adds a fragrant note and a bit of complexity to an otherwise fairly straightforward dish. Finally, if there were a time to spring for freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, this would be it. In an uncomplicated recipe like this one, the quality of each ingredient is paramount.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/11/dining/lh-spaghetti-al-limone/merlin_187482171_3f6192a9-280a-455e-8740-32b0ad87b228-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, pastas, main course", "keywords": "dry white wine, lemon, parmesan, shrimp, spaghetti, tarragon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1982}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound spaghetti", "1 pound large shrimp (18 to 20 count), peeled and deveined, tails on or off\u00a0", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 lemons, zested (about 1 1/2 packed tablespoons), plus 3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon, plus more for serving", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced", "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
