There is so little effort and so much glory to the project. A two-layer cake is simple to produce, but if even that seems daunting, no complaints will arise from a golden Bundt cake. In our times, the simple fact of a homemade cake is enough to impress. Drizzling a liquid glaze over the cake is much easier than frosting, just as pretty, and does not require alarming specialty gadgets such as an \"offset spatula.\"", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jennifer Steinhauer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/22/dining/Sherry-Glaze/Sherry-Glaze-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 10 to 12", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, raisins, sherry, walnut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 33}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 360, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "133 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 pound butter, plus more for greasing pan", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting pan", "3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 1/4 cups firmly packed brown sugar", "2 large eggs, separated", "2/3 cup whole milk", "1 teaspoon vanilla", "1 teaspoon orange extract", "3 1/2 tablespoons sherry", "1/2 cup chopped walnuts", "1/2 cup raisins", "1/3 cup currants", "2 tablespoons finely chopped candied orange peel", "1/2 cup confectioners' sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
