This dish makes use of both the leafy greens and the stems, cooking them alongside potatoes, which add creamy bites. Use your favorite greens or any combination of collard greens, kale, Swiss chard and escarole. The dish is finished with mild shallots, tangy lemon juice and fresh parsley to create a bright sauce.
