{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Thighs With Pickled Cranberries and Onions for Two", "description": "Roasted turkey thighs are quicker, easier and more adaptable than a whole bird, and just as satisfying with their crisp, bronzed skin and tender meat. You can scale this recipe to feed as many as you\u2019re serving, or if you want to make extra for leftovers. Simply double, triple or even quadruple it, spreading out the thighs on your largest sheet pan. Or you can halve it to feed one. The quick-pickled onions and cranberries are a tangy contrast to the richness of the meat, and, with their fuchsia hue, a welcome bit of color on the plate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/dining/06apperex1-turkey/merlin_179473437_84889549-befb-495a-9864-d1e1104479f4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "cranberry, garlic, lemon, lime, thyme, turkey, fall, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 523}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated, pressed or minced", "1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves, preferably lemon thyme", "1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on turkey thighs (2 medium thighs)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 medium red onion, thinly sliced", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh or frozen cranberries", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, basil or parsley leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Finely grate 1/2 teaspoon zest from the lemon and put it in a small bowl with the garlic and thyme.
