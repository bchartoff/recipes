{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Salad With Walnuts and Grapes", "description": "A pile of this chicken salad plopped on top of a bed of greens or tucked between two slices of good bread would make a most excellent lunch or light supper.  It starts with a quick dressing made of mayonnaise, chopped chives, parsley and tarragon and the juice and zest of a lemon. Combine the dressing with chopped, cooked chicken (for ease, use supermarket rotisserie chicken or Thanksgiving turkey leftovers), red grapes, red onion, celery and walnuts. It's a delightful and deeply satisfying combination of flavors (sweet, salty, tangy) and textures (cold, crunchy, juicy) that's almost impossible to stop eating.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jill Santopietro"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/14/dining/14COOKING_CHICUTSGRAPES2/14COOKING_CHICUTSGRAPES2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "chicken, grape, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 307}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 559, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "301 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon mayonnaise", "Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon", "1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste", "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped chives", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon", "1 3-pound roasted chicken, skin removed, meat roughly chopped", "1/3 cup finely chopped red onion", "1/2 cup finely chopped celery", "1 cup halved red seedless grapes", "3/4 cup roughly chopped walnuts, lightly toasted", "Mesclun, optional", "Crusty bread, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, lemon zest and juice, salt and pepper.
