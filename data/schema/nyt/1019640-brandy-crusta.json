{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brandy Crusta", "description": "More than most cocktails, a properly made brandy crusta requires a little effort. Achieving an even sugar rim on a glass and paring a long lemon twist (known as a horse's neck) may take a few tries before you get it right. This recipe, to be used at the new New Orleans bar Jewel of the South, is not very far removed from the one first printed by the bartender Jerry Thomas in his seminal 1862 cocktail manual. Thomas credited the drink\u2019s inventor, the New Orleans bartender Joseph Santini, who had his own bar named Jewel of the South. The resulting cocktail may look too beautiful to drink. But that\u2019s what iPhones are for. Take a picture and get to drinking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/05/dining/05jewelrex/05jewelrex-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "recipeIngredient": ["Lemon juice, for the sugared rim", "Sugar, for the rim", "Peel of 1 lemon, for garnish", "2 ounces Cognac, preferably Pierre Ferrand 1840", "1/2 ounce lemon juice", "1/2 ounce Cura\u00e7ao, preferably Pierre Ferrand", "1/4 ounce maraschino liqueur", "2 dashes Angostura bitters"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Take a small wine glass, wet the rim with lemon juice, then dip in sugar to create an even sugar rim on the glass."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a Y-peeler. begin at the top of the lemon and peel a long, continuous twist, using as much of the skin as possible.
