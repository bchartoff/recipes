He gave me his recipe for it in 2018, part of his recipe for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019335-pan-pizza\">pan pizza,</a> but it\u2019s terrific under your favorite pizza sauce and whatever toppings you desire. You might like sausage and peppers, or sausage and anchovies, or plain with extra cheese. But give black olives, provolone and thinly sliced red onion a shot sometime. Plan ahead, though. The recipe may recall corporate delivery pizza dough. But its preparation takes time to proof and to develop flavor. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/03/magazine/03Eat2-horizontal/03Eat2-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20H30M", "recipeYield": "3 pies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pizza and calzones", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 246}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 444, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "77 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "420 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1000 grams unbleached all-purpose flour, approximately 8 cups", "30 grams kosher salt, approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons", "700 grams lukewarm water, approximately 2 3/4 cups", "60 grams unsalted butter, preferably high-fat European-style, approximately 1/4 cup, melted", "40 grams olive oil, approximately 3 tablespoons, plus more to grease pans", "5 grams active dry yeast, approximately 1 3/4 teaspoons"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the flour and salt in your largest mixing bowl.
