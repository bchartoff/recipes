{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Drizzle Cake", "description": "This light and moist lemon poundcake has a crunchy sugar glaze that crystallizes on top, giving a contrasting texture to the soft crumb underneath. It\u2019s an easy-to-make, crowd-pleasing cake that\u2019s excellent on its own but takes well to embellishments. A scoop of ice cream or sorbet, fruit compote and-or lemon curd are all wonderful alongside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/19/dining/19LEMON-DRIZZLE-CAKE2/19LEMON-DRIZZLE-CAKE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "24 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "dessert, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 675}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 235, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "118 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/225 grams butter (2 sticks), softened, more for greasing pan", "2 cups plus 3 tablespoons/275 grams all-purpose flour", "5 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "Finely grated zest and juice of 2 1/2 lemons", "2 1/4 cups/450 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whole milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees and place a rack in the center.
