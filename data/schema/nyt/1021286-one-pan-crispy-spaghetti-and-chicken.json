{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pan Crispy Spaghetti and Chicken", "description": "This dish has won the hearts of adults and children alike, and for good reason: It\u2019s easy to prepare, fun to eat and doesn\u2019t call upon any hard-to-source ingredients. Cooking the spaghetti in this way lends plenty of texture, allowing for crispier bits at the edges and softer bits throughout. Feel free to make this dish your own by using up any soft herbs or hard cheeses you have on hand, or sprucing it up further with the addition of spice (cumin would work great here). Serve with some lightly cooked greens for a complete meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/26/dining/21ottorex/merlin_175804251_49041ab3-5aac-47ce-b01b-32868a3aba81-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, one pot, pastas, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, parmesan, parsley, spaghetti, thyme, tomato paste", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1963}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 1/2 pounds/1 kilogram bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (4 to 6 thighs), deboned", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 large yellow onion (about 8 ounces/220 grams), cut into 1/2-inch/1-centimeter dice", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves", "2 cups/480 milliliters boiling water", "8 ounces/230 grams spaghetti, broken into thirds", "1/3 lightly packed cup finely grated Parmesan (about 3/4 ounce/20 grams)", "3 tablespoons/20 grams fresh bread crumbs", "1/2 cup/10 grams finely chopped fresh parsley", "1 1/2 teaspoons freshly grated lemon zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit/220 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add 1 tablespoon oil to a large, ovenproof lidded skillet and heat over high.
