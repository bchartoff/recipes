{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Japanese-Style Beef Stew", "description": "The beef stew here will be unfamiliar to most cooks, though it has much in common with the classic American dish. It is Japanese in origin and loaded with the warmth of soy, ginger, sweetness (best provided by mirin, the sweet Japanese cooking wine, but sugar or honey will do, too), winter squash and the peel and juice of a lemon. These simple and delicious counterpoints make a great stew.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/27/dining/27COOKING-JAPANESE-BEEF-STEW1/27COOKING-JAPANESE-BEEF-STEW1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "boneless chuck steak, ginger, squash, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1578}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 418, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "49 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1257 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless chuck in 1-inch to 1 1/2-inch chunks", "2 cups chicken stock, water or dashi (see note)", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup mirin, honey or sugar", "10 nickel-size slices of ginger", "Black pepper to taste", "1 lemon", "1 1/2 pounds peeled butternut, pumpkin or other winter squash or sweet potatoes in 1-inch chunks", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, sear meat until nicely browned on one side, about 5 minutes.
