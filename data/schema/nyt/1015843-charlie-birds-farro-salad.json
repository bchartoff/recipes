{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Charlie Bird\u2019s Farro Salad", "description": "There are two essential steps to a stellar farro salad. The first is cooking the farro with enough salt and aromatics so that it delicious before you combine it with the rest of the ingredients. The second is to use very good olive oil in the dressing. This farro salad, from the restaurant Charlie Bird in SoHo, hits both these marks. The chef Ryan Hardy cooks the farro in apple cider seasoned with bay leaves and plenty of salt, which renders it good enough to eat on its own. But it\u2019s even better after he adds loads of olive oil, plus pistachio nuts and Parmesan cheese to make it even richer. Then, before serving, he folds in fresh vegetables to brighten it up: juicy tomatoes, radishes, arugula and plenty of herbs. There are many farro salads of this ilk out there. This is one of the best.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/26/dining/Charlie-Bird-Farro/merlin_76398808_5bcb8b7a-0d19-4c43-b6d2-da978199d76d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings", "keywords": "farro, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3368}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 398, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "408 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup farro", "1 cup apple cider", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "2 bay leaves", "8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "70 grams Parmesan cheese, shaved with a vegetable peeler (1/2 cup)", "70 grams chopped pistachio nuts (1/2 cup)", "2 cups arugula leaves", "1 cup parsley or basil leaves, torn", "1 cup mint leaves", "3/4 cup halved cherry or grape tomatoes", "1/3 cup thinly sliced radish", "Maldon or other flaky sea salt, for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, bring farro, apple cider, salt, bay leaves and 2 cups water to a simmer.
