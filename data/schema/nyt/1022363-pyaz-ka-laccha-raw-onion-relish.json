{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pyaz Ka Laccha (Raw Onion Relish)", "description": "These floppy, lightly pickled onions are a traditional accompaniment to grilled and tandoor foods throughout India and the rest of South Asia. There are different versions depending on the region, but all are seasoned with salt, spiked with chile (either powdered or fresh) and brightened with some kind of acid, usually lemon juice or vinegar. This recipe, adapted from \u201cMadhur Jaffrey's Indian Cooking\u201d (Barron\u2019s, 1983), uses a combination of sweet paprika and cayenne for an earthy, nuanced flavor, and you can add the spices to taste, making this as fiery or mild as you like. Soaking the onion slices in water before mixing the relish helps soften their sharpness, but you can skip this step if you prefer a stronger onion flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/12SAUCESREX5-bright-MC-raw-onion-relish/merlin_190354083_f943803c-0092-4f10-b640-81b3a9e36415-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "lemon, onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 33}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium onion, preferably a sweet onion, such as Vidalia, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika, plus more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put onions in a bowl and cover with cold water.
