{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hotteok (Sweet Filled Pancakes)", "description": "It is easy to fall in love with hotteok, a Korean street food that\u2019s crisp on the outside, and chewy underneath thanks to sweet rice flour. The center oozes with hot sugary nuts (or other fillings \u2014 feel free to experiment). The dish came to South Korea by way of Chinese immigrants in the 19th century, and this version is adapted from \u201cKorean Soul Food\u201d (Frances Lincoln, 2019) by the chef Judy Joo. She uses muscovado sugar, as it gives the interior a rich flavor and gooey texture, but the more traditional dark brown sugar works well, too. It\u2019s tempting to eat hotteok straight out of the pan, but make sure to let it cool down slightly before enjoying, so the melted sugar doesn\u2019t burn the roof of your mouth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/09/dining/04HOTTEOKREX/merlin_201183642_2b014c32-c1cd-4f2a-a4c1-0b7630745274-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H45M", "recipeYield": "10 hotteok\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "snack, pancakes", "keywords": "muscovado, peanuts, sweet rice flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 191}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters whole milk\u00a0", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar\u00a0", "1 packet/7 grams instant yeast\u00a0", "1 1/2 cups/225 grams bread flour, plus more for dusting (see Tip)", "1 cup/150 grams sweet rice flour\u00a0", "1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "Vegetable oil, for greasing and frying", "1/2 cup/125 grams firmly packed muscovado or dark brown sugar\u00a0", "1/2 cup/75 grams roasted unsalted peanuts, coarsely chopped\u00a0", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon\u00a0", "3/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk to about 105 degrees.
