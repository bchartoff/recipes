Grill or roast the \u201csteaks\u201d and serve them with this gorgeous green sauce. You\u2019ll need only half the amount of salsa verde that this recipe yields, but it keeps very well in the refrigerator and it\u2019s great to have on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/24/science/23recipehealth/23recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, parsley, summer squash, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 97}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "600 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste), halved, green shoots removed", "Salt to taste", "1 anchovy fillet, rinsed (optional)", "1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and chopped", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "3/4 cup (tightly packed) parsley leaves (25 grams)", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 pounds large pattypan squash", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the garlic, salt, anchovy fillet and capers in a mortar and pestle and grind to a paste.
