{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Moo Shu Pork", "description": "This is not your corner takeout's moo shu pork, but it is popular in China, where its northern origins are debated, according to the author Carolyn Phillips. The egg is thought to resemble the flowers of the sweet olive (osmanthus fragrans) shrub, hence its Chinese name, muxi rou, or osmathus blossom pork. The ingredients are stir-fried in batches to cook evenly and retain the vibrancy of the colors. The sauce is intentionally salty, so underseason the stir-fry and add just a dab of sauce to each wheat wrapper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28CHINESE-WEB2/28CHINESE-WEB2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 main course servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "main course, pork tenderloin, rice wine, sweet bean paste", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 284}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 935, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "83 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "54 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "2120 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "1/4 cup sweet bean paste", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons sugar", "2 tablespoons mild rice wine, such as sake", "1 teaspoon sugar", "4 ounces boneless pork tenderloin (or beef or pressed bean curd)", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 cup shredded dried wood ear fungus (often sold as \u201cblack fungus\u201d)\u00a0or 3 fresh wood ears\u00a0", "1/4\u00a0cup dried daylily flowers, or 1 small carrot, peeled and julienned", "6 tablespoons toasted sesame oil or peanut or vegetable oil, divided", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "3 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 large fresh winter bamboo shoot, peeled, blanched and julienned (or frozen and defrosted, julienned), or 8 ounces mung bean sprouts", "2 green onions, trimmed to 1 1/2-inch lengths and cut into thin shreds", "8 thin wheat wrappers (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018334-chinese-wheat-wrappers\">see recipe</a>) or 8 soft flour tortillas, warmed", "2 green onions, trimmed to 1 1/2-inch lengths and cut into thin shreds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Heat sesame oil in a wok over medium heat and mix in sweet bean paste.
