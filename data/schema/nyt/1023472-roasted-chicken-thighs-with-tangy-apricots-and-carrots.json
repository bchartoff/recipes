Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020543-mayo-marinated-chicken-with-chimichurri\">mayo-marinated chicken</a> or Ali Slagle\u2019s <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021294-ginger-lime-chicken\">ginger-lime chicken</a>, this streamlined recipe takes advantage of the best qualities of mayonnaise. Here, serving as both chicken marinade and cooking fat, mayonnaise underpins a sweet and tangy sauce warmed through with chili powder (the spice blend used for chili, not powdered chile peppers). Dried apricots, rehydrated in the pan juices, add delightful morsels of tangy wonder. This recipe features roasted carrots, but you could use any vegetable you like: Sliced red onions and parboiled fingerling potatoes are just a couple of ideas. Serve with white rice or other grains.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/12/dining/12THIGHSREX3-roasted-chicken-thighs-with-tangy-apricots-and-carrot/merlin_212197728_57c40147-9d39-4f2f-a96c-10021a3c8774-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "apricot preserve, carrot, chicken thigh, dried apricot, fish sauce, mayonnaise, roast chicken, sheet-pan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 811}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup apricot preserves", "1/4 cup mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "2 teaspoons chili powder", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup dried apricots (about 3 1/2 ounces)", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, each cut in half", "3 to 4 medium carrots, thinly sliced into coins (about 1 pound)", "Fresh herbs, such as cilantro, parsley and mint, for topping", "Cooked white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the apricot preserves, mayonnaise, lemon juice, fish sauce, chili powder, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper until smooth.
