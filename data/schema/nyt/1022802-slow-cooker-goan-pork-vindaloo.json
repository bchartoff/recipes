{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Goan Pork Vindaloo", "description": "In 1510, when the Portuguese invaded Goa, a region on the west coast of India, they brought with them a dish called carne de vinha d\u2019alho, a sailors\u2019 preserve of pork stored in wine vinegar and garlic. Goan cooks reimagined the dish with local ingredients, like cinnamon, black pepper and coconut palm vinegar, and it came to be called vindaloo. Chiles are always included, but the dish is not traditionally superhot. In this version, the pork benefits from slow cooking in the vinegar and spices, making marination unnecessary. The blender does double duty: It pur\u00e9es the aromatics and grinds the whole spices at the same time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/09/dining/SD-Slow-Cooker-Goan-Pork-Vindaloo/merlin_198116961_f34d2209-e15d-42cf-aada-42b8a39c50d8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, curries, main course", "keywords": "boneless pork shoulder, cardamom, cinnamon stick, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 539}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large yellow or red onion, roughly chopped", "10 garlic cloves, peeled", "2 tablespoons finely chopped ginger (about a 2-inch length of peeled ginger)", "1 tablespoon black or brown mustard seeds", "5 whole cloves", "1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns", "Kosher salt\u00a0", "5 green cardamom pods or 1/4 teaspoon cardamom seeds", "1/2 cup apple cider vinegar or coconut vinegar", "1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick\u00a0", "2 packed tablespoons grated jaggery or light brown sugar, plus more to taste (see Tip)", "2 teaspoons ground cumin\u00a0", "2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "1 tablespoon kashmiri chile powder (see Tip)", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne, or to taste (optional)\u00a0", "3 pounds boneless, skinless pork shoulder, cut into 2- to 3-inch chunks\u00a0", "Cooked basmati rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the onion, garlic, ginger, mustard seeds, cloves, peppercorns and 2 1/2 teaspoons salt in a blender.
