{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramel Badam Burfi", "description": "Badam burfi, a rich, fudgy treat made of almonds, milk and sugar, is a classic Indian sweet. This version, developed by Ashvin Patel, who runs Surati Farsan Mart in Artesia, Calif., incorporates caramel for an even more decadent sweet that tastes somewhere between mithai and a candy bar. These treats are eaten throughout the South Asian subcontinent for celebrations both big and small, from Diwali to a good score on a test. They travel well and can be frozen for at least a few weeks. If the almond base seems a bit dry, kneading it with your hands will help incorporate the milk mixture more completely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna and Jesse Szewczyk"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/19/dining/17DIWALI-SHOPS-REX2/18-DIWALI-SHOPS-REX2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H20M", "recipeYield": "35 (1\u00bd-inch) pieces", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "candies, dessert", "keywords": "almond, almond flour, diwali, freezer friendly, south asian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 211}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "2 cups/16 ounces whole milk", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 ounce yellow liquid food coloring (optional)", "6 cups/671 grams finely ground almond flour (from blanched almonds)", "11 ounces/311 grams soft caramel candies (such as Kraft brand), about 1\u00be cups, unwrapped", "10 ounces/283 grams whole raw almonds (about 2 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grease a 9-by-13-inch metal or glass baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with a strip of parchment paper that hangs over the two long sides to create a sling."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, combine the milk and sugar, and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, 5 to 6 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove from the heat and stir in the food coloring, if using, then gradually stir in the almond flour until a thick, doughlike paste forms with no pockets of unincorporated almond flour.
