{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orange and Radish Salad", "description": "The marriage of radish and orange punches way above its weight as a salad. This version is based on one James Beard collected. Alice Waters, the founder of Chez Panisse, has a recipe, too. So does Paula Wolfert, who dedicated her nine cookbooks to Mediterranean cuisine. Their inspiration came from countless Moroccans who have this salad in regular rotation, often with orange flower water. This recipe leaves it out, opting for a simpler but still refreshing salad that requires careful, precise preparation of the oranges and the radishes to make it shine. If you like, add a pinch of cinnamon to the dressing or sprinkle a bit on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/23Nunn-Orange-Radish-Salad-a/merlin_203820957_8156ee67-1297-4c9d-a081-f399e0745748-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, lunch, salads and dressings, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "lemon, orange, radish, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 198}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 lemons)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Flaky sea salt", "4 large oranges (preferably a mix of Cara Cara and navel oranges), peeled, pith completely removed, citrus sliced into rounds, deseeded and chilled, plus fresh orange zest for garnish if desired", "1 bunch red radishes, cut into thin matchsticks and chilled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine lemon juice, sugar and \u00bc teaspoon salt in a jar.
