The fruit can easily be substituted with whatever is in season, such as raw persimmons, poached pears or caramelized apples. The crushed pistachios are optional but add a welcome pop of crunch and color. Serve as a comforting dessert or a casual midday snack.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/14/dining/14komolaferex-tapioca/merlin_198717234_543beeec-867d-46c3-8355-22c684caaea1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "caramel, citrus, coconut milk, tapioca pearls, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 226}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 cup/190 grams small pearl tapioca", "2 (13 1/2-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk", "1 stalk lemongrass (about 2 1/4 ounces), tough outer part discarded, roughly chopped and smashed", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, scrubbed and thinly sliced (14 grams)", "1/4 cup maple syrup, plus more for drizzling", "1 lime", "3 1/2 pounds/1 1/2 kilograms mixed citrus fruits, such as oranges, blood oranges, tangerines and pink grapefruit", "3/4 cup/138 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup crushed pistachios (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small pot, bring 3 cups of water to a boil and add 1/4 teaspoon of salt.
