{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Arctic Char With Horseradish Crema", "description": "This recipe, from the chef Nick Anderer of Marta in Manhattan, pairs simply seasoned arctic char fillets (feel free to use salmon instead) with a bright, delicious crema with lemon and spicy horseradish. Make sure your grill grates are both clean and very hot before you put down the fish; that will help keep your fish from sticking. You'll also want a large grill spatula for flipping (not tongs) to get under the fish and help you carefully flip the fillets and keep them intact.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/dining/25CHEF6/25CHEF6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "arctic char, dijon mustard, horseradish, sour cream, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 107}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 578, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "711 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces fresh horseradish, peeled and coarsely grated (about 2/3 cup)", "1 1/2 cups sour cream", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons finely chopped chives", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish", "2 to 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus wedges for garnish", "Salt", "4 (6-ounce) arctic char fillets (or use salmon)\u00a0", "Olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the horseradish crema: Peel horseradish with a vegetable peeler and coarsely grate.
