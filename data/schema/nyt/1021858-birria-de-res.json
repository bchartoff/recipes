The chef Josef Centeno, who grew up eating beef and goat birria in Texas, makes a delicious, thickly sauced version based on his grandma Alice\u2019s recipe, mixing up the proteins by using oxtail, lamb on the bone and even tofu (you can, too).\u00a0Preparing the adobo takes time, as does browning the meat, but it\u2019s worth it for the deep flavors in the final dish. The best way to serve birria is immediately and simply, in a bowl, with some warm corn tortillas. But make sure to put any leftovers to work: Extra meat, pulled from the bones, can be shredded for crisp <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021859-quesabirria-tacos\">quesabirria tacos</a>, fried in the birria fat for\u00a0cheesy, lacy edges.
