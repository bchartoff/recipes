The recipe is so easy, the trickiest step will be pulling out your kitchen scale to weigh out the salt. But it's worth doing if you can in order to ensure a properly balanced brine. Emerging from the oven with a beautiful lacquered skin and an incredibly moist and tender texture within, this roast is ideal for a scaled-down Thanksgiving meal, a cozy family dinner or to generate a stack of unbelievably tasty sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/dining/11buttermilk-turkey-breast/merlin_178579260_e1dc1251-b1a2-4beb-993b-2669ab43ca2b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "poultry, roasts, main course", "keywords": "buttermilk, sea salt, turkey, turkey breast, christmas, new year\u2019s day, thanksgiving, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3537}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups buttermilk", "33 grams fine sea salt (2 tablespoons)", "1 half turkey breast (about 2 1/2 pounds), on or off the bone"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "One to two days before you plan to cook, place buttermilk and salt in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag and stir to dissolve salt.
