{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Danny Bowien's Pastrami", "description": "I grew up in Oklahoma City, where barbecue and smoked meats are pretty much a prerequisite for family gatherings. And yet, like many families, <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/thanksgiving\">Thanksgiving</a> around my house included the traditional turkey and ham, which got a little boring. Pastrami brings something different to the table. The idea is to keep the prep simple; the meat takes a long time to cook, but once you have it in the oven or smoker, you don\u2019t have to attend to it. It easily feeds a large crowd and, since it isn\u2019t your typical Thanksgiving centerpiece, it will be a conversation starter. Serve it with plenty of hot mustard.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Danny Bowien"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/12/dining/video-bittman-bowien/video-bittman-bowien-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "15 to 20 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "main course, pastrami", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 133}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 209, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1855 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 5- to 8-pound point-cut corned beef (either red or gray)", "1 cup spicy brown mustard", "1/2 cup Asian fish sauce", "1/2 cup salt", "1/2 cup ground black pepper", "1/2 cup brown sugar", "Pickled mustard condiment, for serving <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015718-pickled-mustard-condiment\">(see recipe) </a>"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Two nights before serving, place the corned beef in a large pot and cover with water.
