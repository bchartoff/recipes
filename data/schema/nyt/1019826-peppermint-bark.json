{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peppermint Bark", "description": "You have two choices when it comes to peppermint bark: If you\u2019d like your bark to be shiny and snappy at room temperature, you must temper the chocolate. The process isn\u2019t complicated, but you\u2019ll need an instant-read thermometer and a bit of patience. But you can also leave tempering to the professionals and make the bark without tempering: Simply microwave both chocolates until melted, assemble the bark as instructed then transfer it to the fridge to harden. You may encounter a bit of condensation and melting when you serve it, but it will still taste great. Be sure to use good-quality bar chocolate instead of chips for more reliable results and better flavor. Look for oil-based peppermint extract, as the water in alcohol-based extracts can cause the chocolate to seize.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/11/dining/ss-peppermint-bark/merlin_147610986_cb95bc1c-6f52-4ee5-b17e-6b012f3febe1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 pounds", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack", "keywords": "candy cane, peppermint extract, semisweet chocolate, white chocolate, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 242}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 313, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "22 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/455 grams good-quality semisweet chocolate (not chips), chopped", "8 ounces/225 grams good-quality white chocolate (not chips), chopped", "1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon oil-based peppermint extract, such as Simply Organic brand", "1/2 cup/75 grams crushed candy canes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
