{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mangonada", "description": "When the summer sun screams across Mexico\u2019s city streets and sandy beaches, mangonadas come to the rescue. Also called chamangos, they can be made with any combination of mango sorbet, chopped fresh mango or mango pur\u00e9e, and may or may not be spiked, but they\u2019ll always contain the salty, spicy and tangy flavors of Taj\u00edn and chamoy. Taj\u00edn, a chile-lime salt, is a delicious addition to sweet and savory foods alike. Its sister condiment, chamoy, is traditionally made from fermented fruit, salt, sugar and chiles. Depending on your location, you can find Taj\u00edn, chamoy and tamarind straws \u2014 their sour, chewy coating adds an extra tickle of tartness \u2014 at supermarkets or Latin American grocers; all three are available online.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/12/dining/10Tajinrex/merlin_156061500_17b2227d-01f8-4839-b8ae-1970228d6b7c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "snack, non-alcoholic drinks, shakes and smoothies", "keywords": "chamoy, mango, tajin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 149}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 large ripe mangoes (about 15 ounces each), peeled, pitted and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 8 cups), or 2 1/2 pounds frozen mango, defrosted", "1/4 cup granulated sugar, or to taste", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 fresh limes)", "1 1/2 cups cold water, or as needed", "3/4 cup silver tequila or rum (optional)", "3/4 to 1 cup chamoy", "Taj\u00edn, to taste", "4 tamarind candy straws (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place 5 cups mango in a blender, reserving the remaining mango.
