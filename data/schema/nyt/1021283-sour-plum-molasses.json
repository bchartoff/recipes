{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sour Plum Molasses", "description": "Often made from sour varieties of pomegranates, apples, cherries, oranges and plums, sour fruit molasses is a staple in Northern Iranian cooking. Hanif Sadr uses wild plums that he forages in the Bay Area, which make his molasses extra sour, but store-bought plums work just as well. It\u2019s a simple but long process, though it doesn\u2019t take all day, as it would in Iran. Similar to preparing a fruit butter without sugar, this recipe calls to cook the fruit once to soften and release juices, then cook again to thicken. A nonstick pot prevents the molasses from burning on the sides and means less stirring. This molasses is worth the effort: You get a thick, spreadable sauce with a deep, caramelized plum flavor. Leftovers keep for a year refrigerated; use them for a variety of Iranian kebabs and stews, or mix with butter and rub on a whole chicken before roasting, as Mr. Sadr does.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Leena Trivedi-Grenier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/09/dining/10Sadrrex1/merlin_175613172_17d5aa21-8d67-4917-8a41-f428c84a072a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "kosher salt, plum, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds plums (about 6 large), wild if possible, a mix of ripe and unripe plums (up to one third can be totally unripe)", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash and dry the plums, then add the whole plums to a medium nonstick pot.
