{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ozoni (Mochi Soup)", "description": "People in Japan and the Japanese diaspora hold mochi-making parties in late December, taking turns swinging an enormous mallet, pounding sticky rice in a hollowed-out stump until smooth and stretchy, then shaping it into balls or disks. Some of the mochi is eaten fresh with sweet or savory toppings, and some is offered plain to the spirits. (Stores sell it for anyone too busy to make it.) On New Year\u2019s Day, hardened mochi pieces are reheated and used in ozoni soup. In Kyoto, round vegetables and mochi bob around in a pale miso soup; in Tokyo, rectangular mochi is served in shoyu broth; in Kanazawa, people add multicolored mochi and sweet shrimp to clear dashi; and in Fukui, it\u2019s red miso soup with mochi and nothing else. This recipe, from Corinne Nakagawa Gooden, originates in Hiroshima, and came to Seattle with her grandmother Hisaye Sasaki in the early 1900s.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hannah Kirshner"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/25/dining/25OSECHIREX1/merlin_166104552_102c5350-c7f9-49fe-98b8-e5d5fdf7a0bf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, chicken, mirin, mizuna, mochi, taro root, yuzus", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 14}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound chicken wings, necks, feet or meaty bones", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "3 tablespoons mirin", "4 golf ball-size or 2 egg-size satoimo (taro root)", "3 ounces mizuna (about 4 cups), roots trimmed and discarded, stems and leaves cut into 2-inch lengths", "8 to 16 (\u00bc-inch-thick) slices Naruto kamaboko (red-and-white spiraled fishcake)", "1 yuzu or Meyer lemon", "8 pieces plain mochi (see Note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chicken stock: Rinse the chicken parts.
