{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Romaine", "description": "Lettuces do nicely on the grill, softening slightly at their centers and charring beautifully at their tips. Their bitterness is a fine counterpart to the sweet spiciness of a lot of grilled foods. In this recipe, the dressing is Caesar-like. Mustard and mayonnaise serve as emulsifiers, while anchovies, garlic and vinegar provide a welcome kick. Make sure to paint the dressing into the crevices between the leaves, so that while the lettuce caramelizes slightly on the exterior, there is still warm creaminess within.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/dining/15JPGRILL3/15JPGRILL3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, parmesan, romaine, appetizer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 390}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 457, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "891 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 clove garlic, peeled and minced", "6 anchovy fillets, rinsed and minced", "2 teaspoons mayonnaise", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons cider vinegar", "Kosher salt and black pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 heads romaine lettuce, tops and bottoms trimmed neatly, the heads cut lengthwise into quarters", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a fire in your grill, leaving one side free of coals.

Sprinkle the lettuce with Parmesan and cover the grill for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the cheese to melt and the lettuce to soften further.
