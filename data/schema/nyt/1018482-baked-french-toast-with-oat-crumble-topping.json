{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked French Toast With Oat Crumble Topping", "description": "The beauty of a baked French toast casserole is that you can prepare it entirely in advance, usually the night before you want to serve it, then pop it into the oven about 45 minutes before you\u2019re ready to eat. This version combines toasted challah with a nutmeg-flavored custard, which is then topped with a crunchy oat crumble. Pears add a ripe and juicy note to the dish, but if you\u2019d rather go fruitless, you can leave them out. The finished dish is sublime served with vanilla-honey syrup drizzled on top, but it is also excellent with maple syrup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/22/dining/22CHALLAH-FRENCHTOAST/22CHALLAH-FRENCHTOAST-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, casseroles", "keywords": "brioche, challah, eggs, honey, oats, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 298}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 413, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "358 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["9 cups/455 grams challah, brioche or other soft bread cut in 1-inch cubes, preferably day old (from a large, 1-pound loaf)", "Butter, for the baking dish", "8 large eggs", "1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters heavy cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters honey", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/63 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/30 grams rolled oats (or use chopped nuts or sliced almonds)", "1/3 cup/67 grams light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/114 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into cubes", "1 large or 2 small pears, peeled or unpeeled as desired, cored and diced into 1/4-inch pieces (optional)", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters good honey", "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
