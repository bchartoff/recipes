Here, there are potatoes, of course, but they\u2019re cut into matchsticks and browned on a sheet pan; and there\u2019s a garlic mayonnaise for dipping. (Make <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017662-aioli\">real-deal aioli</a> if you have a few minutes to spare.) But instead of the traditional smoky, brick-red sauce, similar seasonings are smeared onto chicken before roasting: a mix of lemon, garlic, rosemary, smoked paprika and red-pepper flakes. Using bone-in parts keeps the white meat juicy, while the skin gets crisp and some of the schmaltz glosses the fries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/31/dining/as-rosemary-chicken-and-fries/merlin_198330876_5fbaead6-4108-4ded-8921-7420146bf46d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, mayonnaise, russet potatoes, sheet-pan, smoked paprika", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1675}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup mayonnaise", "1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)", "3 garlic cloves, grated", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 tablespoon smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves (or \u00bd teaspoon dried rosemary)", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "2 large bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (1\u00bd to 2 pounds total), patted dry", "1 large russet potato (about 1 pound), scrubbed", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 tablespoon lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees, and place a sheet pan on the oven\u2019s lowest rack to heat.
