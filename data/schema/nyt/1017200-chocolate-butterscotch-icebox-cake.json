{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate-Butterscotch Icebox Cake", "description": "With homemade chocolate wafer cookies and a maple-laced butterscotch whipped cream, this recipe takes icebox cake to a more sophisticated level without sacrificing any of its lusciousness. You can build the cookies and cream into any shape you like \u2014 a round, a rectangle or a heart, which is what we do here. If you have cookies and cream left over, you can sandwich them together, whoopee-pie style. The wafers can be made up to a week ahead of when you\u2019d like to assemble the cake. Store them airtight and try not to eat them all before you make the rest of the cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/20/dining/icebox-cake/icebox-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "bourbon, dark brown sugar, semisweet chocolate, unsalted butter, unsweetened cocoa, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 175}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 672, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "sodiumContent": "271 milligrams", "sugarContent": "38 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 sticks/170 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1 cup, plus 2 tablespoons/230 grams granulated sugar", "1 egg yolk", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters milk", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon/3 grams baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon/5 grams kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/88 grams unsweetened cocoa, preferably Dutch-process", "1/2 cup/100 grams firmly packed dark brown sugar", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters maple syrup", "2 tablespoons/28 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "Pinch kosher salt", "3 1/2 cups/840 milliliters cold heavy cream", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters bourbon", "1 ounce/28 grams semisweet chocolate, for serving", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters coconut oil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the chocolate wafers:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar together until fluffy.
