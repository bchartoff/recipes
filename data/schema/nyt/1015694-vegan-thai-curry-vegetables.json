{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Thai Curry Vegetables", "description": "Drew Spangler Faulkner, a cooking teacher at L\u2019Academie de Cuisine in Bethesda, Md., makes a Thai green curry that is a kind of comfort food. The sauce, made creamy with coconut milk, and gently spicy with the curry paste, is flavorful yet soothing. The vegetables, which are simply dropped into the sauce, and gently simmered for about 12 minutes, turn out tender, not soggy. It is startlingly simple. She makes her own green curry paste, but the recipe calls for any one of three store bought pastes. Although some green curry pastes contain fish or shrimp paste, she has found three brands which do not: Thai Taste, Maesri and Thai Kitchen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Elaine Louie"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/22/dining/el-vegan-thai-curry-vegetables/el-vegan-thai-curry-vegetables-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1696}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 293, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "448 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["One 13 1/2-ounce can coconut milk (do not shake can)", "1/2 cup vegetable stock", "4 teaspoons soy sauce or tamari soy sauce", "4 teaspoons palm sugar or brown sugar", "6 tablespoons Thai green curry paste, like Thai Taste, Maesri, and Thai Kitchen, none of which have shrimp or fish paste", "1/2 cup diced (1/2 inch) onion", "2/3 cup diced (1/2 inch) red bell pepper", "2/3 cup diced (1/2 inch) zucchini or other summer squash", "2/3 cup diced (1/2 inch) peeled sweet potato", "2/3 cup sliced bamboo shoots, rinsed and drained", "1 cup green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2 inch lengths", "2/3 cup diced (1/2 inch) Asian eggplant", "1 lime", "8 large basil leaves, cut into thin chiffonade"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Open the can of coconut milk without shaking it.
