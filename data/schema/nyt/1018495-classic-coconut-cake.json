The frosting can be made up to a week ahead, wrapped tightly and refrigerated (bring it back to room temperature before using). You could even assemble and frost the whole glorious thing a day ahead; store it at room temperature, covered loosely with plastic wrap or a cake cover.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/19/dining/19COOKING-COCONUTCAKE3/19COOKING-COCONUTCAKE3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "1 9-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "coconut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 565}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/435 grams cake flour or all-purpose flour", "2 cups/170 grams unsweetened finely shredded coconut (or substitute 149 grams medium shredded)", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 1/4 cup/300 milliliters buttermilk", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters coconut, grapeseed or vegetable oil (coconut oil should be liquified before measuring)", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/227 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "4 large eggs", "1 pound/452 grams cream cheese, room temperature\u00a0(2 8-ounce packages)", "3 3/4 cups/453 grams confectioners' sugar (a standard 1-pound box)", "1 1/2 cups/341 grams unsalted butter (3 sticks), at room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 cups/171 grams coconut flakes or chips (or substitute 224 grams medium shredded, unsweetened coconut)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake the cake:\u00a0Heat oven to 325 degrees.\u00a0Spray two 9-inch cake pans with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.
