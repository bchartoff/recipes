{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Goat Cheese and Broccoli Sandwich", "description": "I\u2019ve been finding all sorts of uses for finely chopped broccoli crowns lately (see my burgers from a couple of weeks ago). I make a broccoli and goat cheese spread for this sandwich. I briefly steam the broccoli, chop it finely and mash it with the goat cheese. Then I spread it on country bread, sprinkle with the nut and spice mix known as dukkah and top with the other slice of bread. The dukkah adds the surprise touch. You\u2019ll only use half the chopped steamed broccoli in one sandwich. But you\u2019ll want to use up the rest in another.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/27/science/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 1", "recipeCuisine": "american, french, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 70}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 269, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "436 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 broccoli crown (about 2 ounces)", "1 ounce goat cheese (about 1/4 cup crumbled)", "2 to 3 teaspoons finely chopped fresh herbs, such as chives, parsley and  marjoram (optional)", "1 garlic clove, halved (optional)", "2 slices whole-grain country bread", "1/2 teaspoon dukkah (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014696-peanut-dukkah\">see recipe</a>)", "1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam broccoli for 4 minutes, until tender but bright.
