Their brightly lit glass cases are lined with fresh-baked bread and rich pastries, begging you to order too many. As a child, I clamored for pastelillos (also called pastelitos) de guayaba. The pastries typically have a flaky crust and are filled with a generous smear of concentrated guava paste \u2014 an embodiment of tropical Caribbean flavor \u2014 and often with cheese, served glazed or dusted with powdered sugar. In East Harlem, or El Barrio, New York\u2019s historic Puerto Rican enclave where I lived for some time, I discovered <a href=\"https://valenciabakeryny.com/\">Valencia Bakery</a> on East 103rd Street, which made a bite-size version with a generous amount of confectioners\u2019 sugar, creating a portal between the island and my new home. My recipe is inspired by theirs. These are excellent with coffee, and will keep for several days, benefiting from a reheat in the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/22puertoricanrex4-pastelillos/merlin_184863219_f4bd82ca-5824-49af-8b72-96e3b7e6c5ad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, pastries, dessert, side dish", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, farmer's cheese, guava paste, puerto rican, puff pastry, queso fresco", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 246}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (17.3-ounce) package puff pastry (2 sheets)", "1 egg", "1 tablespoon milk of choice, including oat milk or other nondairy milks", "7 ounces guava paste, cut into 16 (1/4-inch) square or rectangular slices", "6 ounces queso fresco en hoja or farmer cheese, cut into 16 (1/4-inch) slices", "2 to 3 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set out puff pastry to thaw for 40 minutes at room temperature."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Once pastry is thawed, line a 12-by-17-inch baking sheet with 2 pieces of parchment paper.
