{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky White Bean and Beef Sloppy Joes", "description": "This update on the kid-friendly classic uses half the meat as a traditional sloppy Joe recipe, but retains the qualities that everyone loves: a tart-sweet savoriness and a quick cooking time. You can substitute ground pork, turkey, lamb or plant-based ground meat for the beef; the key is to use a protein that\u2019s not too lean. A little fat helps carry the flavor of the meat through the entire dish. (If you use plant-based meat or you only have lean meat on hand, add another tablespoon of olive oil or your preferred fat.) The addition of adobo sauce from a can of chipotles imparts smoke, with just a hint of heat. (If you\u2019d like a spicier version, by all means, chop up one or two of the chipotles and add them.) The leftover chipotles keep for at least two weeks in the fridge or indefinitely in the freezer, and they are a welcome addition to many dishes, like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019693-slow-cooker-chipotle-honey-chicken-tacos\">chicken tacos</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013041-turkey-and-hominy-chili-with-smoky-chipotle\">chili</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/01/dining/sd-meat-and-bean-sloppy-joes/merlin_188545257_d5a95e29-a0b2-4fe7-bdcd-a87a63e5dfe8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "adobo sauce, beef, white beans", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 503}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt", "1 red, yellow or orange bell pepper, finely chopped", "1/2 pound ground beef, preferably 85 percent lean", "1 packed tablespoon light or dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "3/4 cup canned or jarred tomato pur\u00e9e", "1 tablespoon adobo sauce (from canned chipotles in adobo)", "1 tablespoon cider vinegar", "1 (15-ounce) can cannellini or pinto beans, drained", "4 hamburger buns, preferably potato buns", "Tomato slices and pickle chips, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Warm the oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over high heat.
