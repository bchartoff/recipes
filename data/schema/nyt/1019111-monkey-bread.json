{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Monkey Bread", "description": "Monkey bread is a hybrid of several classic treats: sticky buns, cinnamon rolls and a Hungarian coffee cake called aranygaluska. Since it bakes up high in a Bundt pan, the presentation is pretty spectacular. The best monkey breads need the spring and savor of real bread, to balance the sweetness. This version starts with Melissa Clark\u2019s excellent <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017369-excellent-white-bread\">white bread recipe</a>. If you have a stand mixer and have never made bread, consider this your gateway recipe. It\u2019s a basic dough \u2014 no scary starters, long risings or unfamiliar flours \u2014 and the heavy lifting is done by the machine. You can slice it, but it's more fun to just put it on the table, sit down and join your brunch guests in pulling off one little dough ball after another.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/27/dining/27monkeybread/27monkeybread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick breads, dessert", "keywords": "brown sugar, caramel sauce, cinnamon, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 414}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 896, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "131 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "564 milligrams", "sugarContent": "78 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 teaspoons/7 grams active dry yeast (1 package)", "1 1/2 cups lukewarm milk (about 105 degrees, or just warm to the touch)", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon/15 grams kosher salt", "3 tablespoons/43 grams unsalted butter, melted, more for greasing bowl", "2 eggs, at room temperature", "5 to 6 cups/640 grams to 768 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/227 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks)", "2 cups/440 grams packed dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup heavy cream, more to taste", "Salt (optional)", "1/2 cup/114 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted and cooled to room temperature", "1 1/4 cups/275 grams light brown sugar or maple sugar, or a combination of dark brown sugar and white sugar", "2 tablespoons ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "About 3/4 cup/80 grams chopped toasted pecans or walnuts, more for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a mixer, dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm milk.
