But believe me, you\u2019ll be pleased by this herbal concoction. Pineapple has so much sweetness and flavor on its own, and it marries well with the peppery, anisy basil. Very little else is required (no banana in this smoothie). I like to use kefir, but yogurt will work too. Pistachios and chia seeds bulk up the drink nicely, and the pistachios contribute to the pale green color.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/29/science/01recipehealth/01recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "1 generous serving", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, shakes and smoothies", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 151}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup, tightly packed, basil leaves", "1/4 ripe pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into chunks (about 6 ounces)", "3/4 cup plain kefir or yogurt", "1 teaspoon honey", "1 heaped tablespoon pistachios", "1/2 teaspoon chia seeds", "2 or 3 ice cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in a blender and blend at high speed for 1 minute, or until smooth.
