In this variation using <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023417-baek-kimchi-white-kimchi\">baek kimchi</a> (white kimchi), the same warmth of other jjigaes is evoked even without red chiles, and lets you taste the cabbage more fully, especially once it\u2019s cooked down to a tenderness that\u2019s almost spoonable. A hunk of braised pork is always a good idea, especially when braised in the salty, savory and gingery aromas of fermented napa cabbage kimchi. In this stew, the kimchi does most of the heavy lifting, but depending on how flavorful your batch is, you can season to taste at the end with additional fish sauce. Don\u2019t skip the white rice; it\u2019s the soft, familiar foil against the zingy stew.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/24/dining/22KIMJANGREX-baek-kimchi-jjigae/merlin_211376415_64604b9a-5f7a-4383-8b78-bb7d4b7128dc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "boneless pork shoulder, kimchi", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 197}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound boneless pork shoulder", "1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger, scrubbed and thickly sliced lengthwise", "Salt", "2 packed cups coarsely chopped ripe <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023417-baek-kimchi-white-kimchi\">white kimchi</a> (about 1 pound), plus any accumulated juices", "1 medium yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced", "4 garlic cloves, crushed and coarsely chopped", "Fish sauce, to taste (optional)", "2 scallions, thinly sliced at an angle", "Cooked white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the pork, ginger and 3 cups of cold water.
