The result was delectable. We ate the sauce straight from the pot. We ate it from the serving dish. And we ate what was left for dessert that night, poured over Ronnybrook vanilla ice cream with chewy gingersnaps from Hawthorne Valley on the side. My children\u2019s adoration of me was unaffected by the butterscotch, but their energy level definitely got a boost from all the sugar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Celia Barbour"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/dining/Butterscotch-Peaches/Butterscotch-Peaches-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "dessert, peach, sugar, vanilla ice cream, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 medium or 5 large ripe peaches", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup cream", "1/2 cup sugar", "1 tablespoon honey", "Pinch of salt", "3/4 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "Vanilla ice cream", "Almond biscotti, gingersnaps or other cookies"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large bowl with ice and water, and set aside.

Place over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is completely melted. Raise heat to medium and let boil without stirring until it turns a rich golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. (Because of honey and cream it will appear to turn pale brown before it has caramelized; wait until it has darkened noticeably, thickened and reduced before proceeding.) Carefully pour contents of skillet into saucepan; it will boil and spatter; stir to combine. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Add vanilla or other flavoring. Serve warm or at room temperature over ice cream, with cookies on the side."}]}
