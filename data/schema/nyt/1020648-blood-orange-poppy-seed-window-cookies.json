You\u2019ll want to roll out the dough on a silicone baking mat or sheet of parchment paper, removing the excess, rather than trying to move each cookie, which might distort its shape. The added bonus is that you can also slide them onto a baking sheet should the dough warm up too much, and chill it until it\u2019s workable again. You can fill these window cookies with any kind of marmalade, jam or preserves \u2014 even lemon curd. If using any of the first three, warm the filling in the microwave, adding a dribble of water if very thick. Strain through a sieve to remove the solids, if you want.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/ss-window-cookies/merlin_163736391_d9bbe92f-2f06-49f7-a4e5-bb1f0bbe5771-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen sandwich cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "blood orange, butter, flour, marmalade, poppy seeds, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 201}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 1/2 tablespoons poppy seeds, plus more for sprinkling", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), softened", "2/3 cup/135 grams granulated sugar", "2 large egg yolks, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 tablespoons buttermilk (or 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons milk mixed with 1 teaspoon lemon juice)", "1 cup blood orange marmalade", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine flour, poppy seeds, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl.
