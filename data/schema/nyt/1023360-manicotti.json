{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Manicotti", "description": "Manicotti are very large ridged pasta tubes that are stuffed and baked. The filling is a tasty combination of cheeses, often with the addition of ground meat or vegetables. In this simple weeknight version, the pasta is stuffed with a three-cheese filling flavored with garlic and nutmeg. Ricotta adds creaminess, mozzarella melts and binds, and Parmigiano-Reggiano adds nutty flavor and salinity. For ease and speed, this recipe suggests the use of store-bought marinara sauce. If you\u2019d like to add some greens to the dish, thaw a 10-ounce package of frozen spinach, squeeze out all the water, then finely chop the spinach and add it to the filling before stuffing the manicotti.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/27/dining/kc-manicotti/merlin_213609927_74f33018-9f07-4186-9697-869772a5cfbd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas, main course", "keywords": "marinara sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, pasta, ricotta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 483}, "recipeIngredient": ["Olive oil, for greasing the dish", "Salt and pepper", "1 (8-ounce) box manicotti shells (about 14)", "1 1/2 pounds/3 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese", "8 ounces/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 large egg, beaten", "3 cups store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015987-classic-marinara-sauce\"><span>homemade marinara sauce</span></a>"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
