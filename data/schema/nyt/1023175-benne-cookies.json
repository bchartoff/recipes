Benne seeds, sesame seeds that enslaved Africans brought with them to the southeastern shores of America, have long been a staple in Gullah Geechee cooking. They are an important component in rice dishes and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1628-benne-cheese-wafers\">savory crackers</a> and are the stars of these buttery wafers. Regular sesame seeds will work fine, especially if you toast them in butter, but Mrs. Meggett suggests you try to buy benne seeds, an heirloom seed that is available online. They have a nutty, almost burned honey flavor and bring out the umami in the cookies.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/11/dining/09gullah-cookbookrex2/merlin_206402367_75ef7a41-83b4-4029-b068-5cb89d797885-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 40 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "benne seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 200}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/129 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing", "1 cup/140 grams benne seeds or sesame seeds", "1 cup/125 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/55 grams packed light brown sugar", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
