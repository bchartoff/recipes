{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pineapple-Marinated Chicken Breasts", "description": "Bromelain, the group of enzymes in fresh pineapple, is excellent at breaking down the connective tissues in thick, fibrous chicken breasts. In this simple marinade, grated pineapple completely alters the texture of the breast meat, resulting in something that\u2019s akin to luscious dark meat. Briefly marinating here is important: Leave it too long and the chicken will fall apart during cooking, becoming shreddy and a little gluey. Fifteen minutes is the sweet spot. The accompanying pineapple salsa is a bright topping for the juicy morsels of aromatic chicken and rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/04/dining/04chickenrex2/merlin_188173023_7594846e-27dc-4248-923c-af361af58a95-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, fish sauce, pineapple", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3205}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 packed tablespoons dark brown sugar", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for cooking", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 cup diced fresh pineapple (1/2-inch chunks)", "1/4 cup finely diced red onion", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro", "2 tablespoons finely grated fresh pineapple, including accumulated juices", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "Cooked white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, stir together the brown sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, garlic powder, ground cayenne and black pepper.
