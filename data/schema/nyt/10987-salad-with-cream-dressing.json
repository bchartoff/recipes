{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salad With Cream Dressing", "description": "The inspiration for this salad that my wife prepares occasionally at home comes from the area of France where I was raised, near Lyon. It is always better done at home; the dressing lends itself to individual rather than high-volume preparation, and the delicacy required to properly clean and thoroughly dry the greens without bruising them is more easily achieved in the home kitchen. The salad should be cool but not ice cold, and should be tossed at the last minute, just before serving, especially if Boston or red-tipped leaf lettuce is used.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacques Pepin"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Six servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, condiments, salads and dressings", "keywords": "gluten-free, raw, vegetarian, heavy cream, red wine vinegar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 52, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "41 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon good red-wine vinegar", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "6 tablespoons heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove and discard any damaged outer lettuce leaves and tear the lettuce into two-inch pieces.
