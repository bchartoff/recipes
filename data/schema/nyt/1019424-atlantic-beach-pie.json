{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Atlantic Beach Pie", "description": "Like a dreamy mash-up between a Key lime and lemon meringue pie, this surprisingly fast and easy dessert is adapted from Bill Smith, the chef at Crook's Corner, a Chapel Hill, N.C. restaurant that specializes in Southern comfort food. He was inspired by the lemon pies he ate at seafood restaurants in Atlantic Beach, N.C., while vacationing there as a child. While a food processor makes quick work of the saltine cracker crust, you don\u2019t really need any special equipment \u2014 you can just as easily make it with your hands. Top it with whipped cream just before serving, and if you\u2019re feeling flush, sprinkle it with flaky sea salt as they do at Crook's Corner, and citrus zest as we do: a lazy summer\u2019s day in pie form.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/25/dining/25pie1/merlin_141364530_a347f792-5279-4738-9d76-72114e89395d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H55M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, lemon, saltines, sweetened condensed milk, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1360}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 sleeves saltine (with salt) crackers (about 60 crackers/200 grams)", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter\u00a0(1 stick),\u00a0at room temperature", "4 egg yolks", "1 (14-ounce/396-gram) can sweetened condensed milk", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters lemon or lime juice, or a mix of the two", "Pinch of kosher salt", "Fresh whipped cream, lemon or lime zest and flaky sea salt, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees.\u00a0Using a food processor or your hands, pulse or crush the crackers finely (stop before all the crackers turn to dust; it\u2019s O.K. if you have some little pieces).
