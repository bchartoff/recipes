{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheese Souffl\u00e9", "description": "I swoon at a well-made cheese souffl\u00e9, a dish that nobody seems to make anymore. When I was learning to cook, that souffl\u00e9 seemed like the ultimate challenge, and never was I more proud than when I made my first successful one, puffed high and golden brown, its center still a molten sauce. They are actually quite easy. But they do require the best eggs and cheese (and I wouldn\u2019t scoff at a truffle), and attention when you beat the egg whites, because if you overbeat them they\u2019ll break apart when you fold them into the b\u00e9chamel with the cheese. Instead of Gruy\u00e8re alone you can also use a mix of nutty-tasting Gruy\u00e8re style cheeses; for example, use a mix of Comt\u00e9 (French Gruy\u00e8re), Beaufort or Fribourg and Gruy\u00e8re, or substitute Comt\u00e9 for all of the Gruy\u00e8re.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/25/dining/25eggs1/25eggs1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "5 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butter, cheese, eggs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 151}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 311, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "377 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["55 grams butter (3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons)", "35 grams Parmesan (1/3 cup), grated", "20 grams minced shallot (2 tablespoons)", "45 grams flour (4 tablespoons), sifted", "1 1/2 cups milk", "3 grams salt (1/2 teaspoon), more as needed", "Pinch of freshly ground white pepper", "Pinch of nutmeg", "6 large egg yolks", "7 large egg whites", "1 gram cream of tartar (1/8 teaspoon)", "100 grams Gruy\u00e8re cheese (1 cup), grated", "1 good-size black or white truffle, grated (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using 10 grams (2 teaspoons) butter, grease a 2-quart souffl\u00e9 dish.
