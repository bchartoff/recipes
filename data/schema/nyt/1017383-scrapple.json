But ours, first published in December 1953 and later in the Food News Department\u2019s booklet \u201cEncore for the Roast,\u201d was devised as a way to use up leftover pork loin. You can substitute in 1 1/2 cups pur\u00e9ed pork loin or start from scratch with ground pork. You\u2019ll need a food processor and a double boiler for this recipe. The latter will save you 45 minutes active stirring time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/30/dining/scrapple/scrapple-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, project, sausages", "keywords": "bacon fat, cornmeal, ground pork, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 44}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups ham broth or other meat stock (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017382-ham-broth\">see recipe</a>)", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "3/4 cup cornmeal, more for frying", "1 pound ground pork (80/20, or 80 percent lean)", "1 tablespoon grated onion", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh sage, finely chopped", "Bacon fat, for greasing and frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring ham broth, 1 1/2 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in the top of a double boiler over direct heat.
