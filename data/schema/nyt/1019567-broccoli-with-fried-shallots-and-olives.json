{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broccoli With Fried Shallots and Olives", "description": "The fried shallots on top of this dish make it seem a little like a baked green-bean casserole, but with broccoli as the starring vegetable. Olives and thinly sliced garlic give it verve, contrasting nicely with the sweetness of the shallots. You can cook the broccoli and fry the shallots a day ahead. Store the broccoli in the refrigerator, bringing to room temperature before serving; keep the fried shallots in a paper towel-lined container or a jar with an airtight lid. If they wilt, you can crisp them back up by popping them briefly in the oven. Be sure to save the shallot-flavored oil to use for saut\u00e9eing the garlic and olives right before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/07/dining/07broccolirex1/07broccolirex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "broccoli, olives, shallot, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 265}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 160, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "348 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds broccoli (about 2 bunches), stems peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, florets cut into bite-size pieces", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "4 shallots, sliced into rings", "5 fat garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup chopped pitted olives, such as\u00a0Kalamata, Ni\u00e7oise or Picholine\u00a0(a combination of black and green is nice)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste", "2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, or to taste (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
