{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Hot-Honey Chicken Sandwiches", "description": "These simple sandwiches are reminiscent of a lazy summer cookout \u2014 but doable on a weeknight. Though slow cookers are often associated with winter, they\u2019re great in hot weather because they don\u2019t heat up the kitchen like ovens do. For this recipe, there is no need to add liquid to the pot before cooking, because the chicken will release moisture as it cooks. If you have a lot of liquid remaining when the chicken is done, that\u2019s absolutely fine; just incorporate it into the shredded chicken. But if you have a little extra time, before you shred the chicken or add the honey, remove the chicken to a bowl with tongs, pour the juices into a small saucepan, and simmer until the juices are reduced by half to intensify flavor and thicken the sauce. After that, simply pick the recipe back up at Step 3.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/sd-hot-honey-pulled-chicken-sandwiches/merlin_190467270_1b0a450c-a204-48a6-b141-4180185c8579-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, green cabbage, honey, slow cooker, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1938}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil\u00a0", "2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon ground sweet paprika", "1/4 teaspoon ground smoked paprika\u00a0", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup honey\u00a0", "2 teaspoons cider vinegar, plus more to taste", "2 heaping cups shredded green cabbage (about 8 ounces or 1/4 medium green cabbage)", "1/4 cup mayonnaise, plus more for the buns", "3 scallions, sliced", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "4 rolls or buns (preferably onion rolls)", "Vinegary hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the chicken, oil, 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, the onion powder, sweet paprika and smoked paprikas.
