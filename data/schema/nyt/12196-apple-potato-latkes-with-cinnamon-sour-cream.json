{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple-Potato Latkes With Cinnamon Sour Cream", "description": "These latkes are golden, crunchy, salty-sweet and very satisfying, with applesauce and without. The secret here is squeezing the liquid out of the grated apple and potato mixture before frying; otherwise the latkes end up on the soft side rather than truly crisp. This is because apples are juicier than potatoes, so a firm squeeze in a clean dish towel brings down the moisture content considerably.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/14/dining/14APPE_SPAN/14APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 dozen latkes", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european, jewish", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, apple, potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 127}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 151, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "169 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons sour cream or Greek yogurt", "1/4  teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon maple syrup", "2 Golden Delicious apples, peeled and cored", "1 large russet potato, peeled", "1 medium yellow onion, peeled", "2/3 cup all-purpose flour", "3 large eggs", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Olive oil, for frying."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream or yogurt, cinnamon and syrup.

Once the oil is hot (a drop of batter placed in the pan should sizzle), drop heaping tablespoons of batter into the pan, cooking 3 to 4 latkes at a time. Use a spatula to flatten the scoops into disks. When the edges of the latkes are brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes, flip them. Cook until the second side is deeply browned, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the latkes to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve with dollops of the cinnamon sour cream on top."}]}
