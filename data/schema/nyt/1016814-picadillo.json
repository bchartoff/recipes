{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Picadillo", "description": "Picadillo is one of the great dishes of the Cuban diaspora: a soft, fragrant stew of ground beef and tomatoes, with raisins added for sweetness and olives for salt. Versions of it exist across the Caribbean and into Latin America. This one combines ground beef with intensely seasoned dried Spanish chorizo in a sofrito of onions, garlic and tomatoes, and scents it with red-wine vinegar, cinnamon and cumin, along with bay leaves and pinches of ground cloves and nutmeg. For the olives you may experiment with fancy and plain, but rigorous testing here suggests the use of pimento-stuffed green olives is the best practice. A scattering of capers would be welcome as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/21/magazine/21eat/21eat-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cuban", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beef, chorizo, olives, sofrito", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1878}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 472, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "653 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 medium-size yellow onions, \n peeled and chopped", "2 ounces dried chorizo, diced", "4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "1 1/2 pounds ground beef", "Kosher salt and freshly ground \n black pepper", "4 ripe tomatoes, chopped, or \n one 28-ounce can whole tomatoes, \n drained and crushed", "2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "2 bay leaves", "Pinch of ground cloves", "Pinch of nutmeg", "2/3 cup raisins", "2/3 cup pitted stuffed olives."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the olive oil in a large, heavy \npan set over a medium-high flame, and \nheat until it begins to shimmer.
