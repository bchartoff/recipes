{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cold Cantaloupe Soup", "description": "Cold cantaloupe soup has become a summer staple in my house, a quick and easy solution to the question of a first course at dinner. I have even served it in espresso cups for guests to sip with cocktails. All it takes is a ripe orange-fleshed melon, like a cantaloupe, or perhaps a musk melon from a farm stand.\n\nI chill the melon, and when I\u2019m ready to prepare the soup, I peel and seed it, then cut it into chunks. I find that if I start with a small amount of the chunks in the blender and process them until they are pur\u00e9ed, I can then add the rest gradually with no need for additional liquid. The juice of one lime and salt to taste are all I add, except for a final drizzle of my best balsamic vinegar on top. You can add mint leaves, cayenne or even a garnish of diced prosciutto or feta instead of the vinegar if you wish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/26/dining/26BURNER4/26BURNER4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, balsamic vinegar, cantaloupe", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 116}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 36, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "244 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cantaloupe or other ripe, orange-fleshed melon, chilled, peeled and seeded", "Juice of 1 lime", "Salt to taste", "2 teaspoons good quality balsamic vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut cantaloupe in 1-inch chunks.
