{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramel Apple Pie", "description": "Here, a carnival caramel apple is stacked onto a buttery crust: The snap of fresh apple slices gives way to soft salted caramel and a melt-in-your-mouth cookie base. It\u2019s put together as a pie with layers like a bar cookie for a look that\u2019s impressive but simple to pull off. The dough doesn\u2019t require rolling. Instead, you press crumbs into a pie plate and end up with a cross between sturdy shortbread and sandy French sabl\u00e9s. A candy thermometer takes the guesswork out of caramel, but you don\u2019t need one to make the stretchy filling. For a tangy contrast to the filling\u2019s sweetness, use tart green apples, but feel free to swap them for other varieties you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/13/dining/13PIESREX-caramel-apple/merlin_215056365_e6a05d9d-1de1-4968-9d35-318cd8f465f7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "apple, corn syrup, food processor, heavy cream, make-ahead, pie, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 285}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/73 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1 1/3 cups/193 grams all-purpose flour", "11 tablespoons/154 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes", "1 1/2 cups/324 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons light corn syrup", "5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter", "1 cup/230 grams heavy cream", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1 to 2 Granny Smith or other tart green apples", "1/4 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Pulse the sugar, salt and vanilla in a food processor until the sugar is evenly moistened.
