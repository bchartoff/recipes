{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Focaccia With Herbed-Honey Plums and Prosciutto\u00a0", "description": "Featuring a combination of tart plums, sweet honey and salty prosciutto, this focaccia is delicious as a snack or appetizer and also as a light lunch when paired with a salad. Go with fresh, ripe but firm plums as they will soften once baked. The herb of choice is rosemary, but any fragrant, woodsy herbs, such as thyme, marjoram or oregano work well, too. Letting the dough ferment slowly in the refrigerator builds more flavor. The dough can be refrigerated up to 3 days in advance of baking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/23/dining/YK-Focaccia-with-Herbed-Honey-Plums/merlin_194732544_08b01b38-e21a-4d86-8577-68ad9ba69845-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, breads, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "fall, summer, focaccia, plum, prosciutto", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 401}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon instant dry yeast", "1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110 degrees)", "3 1/4 cups/453 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup honey", "2 sprigs rosemary, thyme, marjoram, oregano or any woodsy herb of choice", "3 firm but ripe plums (about 12 ounces), pitted and thinly sliced", "4 ounces very thinly sliced prosciutto, torn into 2- to 3-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the yeast and warm water.
