{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown-Butter Salmon With Scallions and Lemon", "description": "This dish is a celebration of soft food and subtle flavors. To prevent overcooking, the salmon bakes in a light yet comforting sauce that\u2019s made with just three simple ingredients: butter, scallions and lemon peel. The salmon comes out silky, and the sauce is nutty from the browned butter and slightly sweet from the roasted scallions and lemon peel. Serve with a squeeze of lemon for freshness and a simple side like broccolini, green beans, grains or pasta. This technique also works for other fish like cod, halibut or arctic char.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/30/dining/as-brown-butter-salmon/merlin_194895396_9813e3dc-ef66-471d-9259-a31802fe80a0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "brown butter, lemon, salmon, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 821}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds salmon, skinless or skin-on (1 large fillet or four 6-ounce fillets)", "Salt and black pepper", "1 lemon", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
