The ultimate hands-off, do-ahead dinner, these are done on the stovetop in a large Dutch oven but can easily be adapted to a slow cooker if that\u2019s your thing. When purchasing the ribs, ask for the thickest, meatiest ones available as they tend to shrink quite a bit once braised.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/dining/16COOKING-BRAISED-SHORTRIBS/16COOKING-BRAISED-SHORTRIBS-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, soups and stews", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1589}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "5 pounds bone-in short ribs, at least 1 1/2 inches thick", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 large heads garlic, halved crosswise", "1 medium onion (about 10 ounces), chopped", "4 ribs celery (about 8 ounces, chopped", "2 medium carrots (about 6 ounces), chopped", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 cups dry red wine (about half a bottle)", "2 cups beef stock or bone broth (use beef bouillon dissolved in water if unavailable; chicken stock will work in a pinch), plus more as needed", "4 sprigs thyme", "1 cup parsley, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup finely chopped chives", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 275 degrees.
