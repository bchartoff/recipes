{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herbed Garlic Bread", "description": "There are two proper ways to use garlic: pounding and blooming. Pound raw garlic into a paste that dissolves into food, leaving behind only a faint rumor of its presence. To cook garlic, sizzle but don't brown it before adding it to food \u2014 this is blooming, and it will tame garlic's raw fire. Put both techniques into practice to make this unforgettable loaf of garlic bread. First, make a garlic butter rich with herbs and Parmesan. Then, score the loaf into thick slices and slather each with butter. Wrap and bake, then pull the steaming, mahogany-crusted bread from the oven, and stuff each slot with herb salad. The fragrant loaf will barely have a chance to cool before everyone at the table begins to tear into and devour it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/01/magazine/01eat1/01eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, breads", "keywords": "basil, butter, chives, garlic, parmesan, parsley, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 269}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 252, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "263 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 large cloves garlic", "10 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "Salt", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley, plus 1/2 cup parsley leaves", "2 tablespoons chopped chives, plus 1/2 cup chives cut into 1-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons chopped basil, plus 20 basil leaves", "Heaping 1/3 cup finely grated Parmesan (about \u00be ounce)", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 1-pound loaf rustic country bread", "Extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange a rack in the center of your oven, and preheat to 400."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bloom half the garlic: Thinly slice 7 of the cloves.
