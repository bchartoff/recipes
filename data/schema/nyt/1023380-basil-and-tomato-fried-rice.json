{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basil and Tomato Fried Rice", "description": "Summer\u2019s dynamic duo of tomato and basil make a surprising appearance in this aromatic fried rice. The tomatoes cook down slightly and become sweeter, coating the rice in their vibrant, sun-kissed juices, while basil adds a peppery perfume. This recipe is very adaptable, so make it your own. Use any tomato variety you like. Add more or less basil, or use Thai or holy basil in its place for even bolder flavors. If you want more heat, leave the seeds in the chiles. Finally, for a fresh element, serve with cucumber slices and a lime wedge on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/01/dining/HM-tomato-and-basil-fried-rice/merlin_210026700_8232a93f-3b37-4eba-b072-7a544beaedfc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, grains and rice, main course", "keywords": "basil, egg, rice, tomatoes, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1068}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 eggs", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "Neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable oil", "1 yellow onion, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped", "1 to 2 bird\u2019s-eye chiles (or other hot chiles), deseeded and finely chopped\u00a0", "2 pounds firm, ripe large or cherry tomatoes (see Tip), cut into 3/4-inch wedges if using large tomatoes", "5 to 6 cups cooked leftover rice, preferably jasmine", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 1/2 cups tightly packed basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, whisk the eggs with 1/2 teaspoon salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large wok or 12-inch well-seasoned cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high.
