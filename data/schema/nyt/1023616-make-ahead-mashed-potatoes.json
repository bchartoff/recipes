{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Make-Ahead Mashed Potatoes", "description": "It\u2019s not just that mashed potatoes can be made ahead; they actually end up creamier and fluffier when prepared in advance. When mashed potatoes chill, their starches firm up, and when reheated gently, they relax into a mash with an even silkier texture. But you can\u2019t save potatoes that start out gluey. Shearing cooked spuds with any blade \u2014 food processor, blender or hand mixer \u2014 releases enormous amounts of starch and turns the mash into spackle. Here, you break up the potatoes by hand or with a stand mixer\u2019s paddle attachment for an airy smoothness. If you have a ricer or food mill, you can use that instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/09/dining/02korex-potatoes/merlin_215517513_bdc3b19b-d142-43b0-a8f4-055b6ebe44d0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings (10 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, side dish", "keywords": "butter, make-ahead, mashed potato, milk, russet potatoes, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 863}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and pepper", "5 pounds russet potatoes", "10 tablespoons butter, sliced and at room temperature, plus more for reheating", "1 cup whole milk, warmed, plus more for reheating"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large pot with 8 cups cold water and 1 tablespoon salt.
