{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Tomato Carbonara", "description": "Carbonara, a Roman specialty, transforms a few basic ingredients into a rich pasta dish. It\u2019s traditionally made with Parmigiano-Reggiano, eggs, guanciale (cured pork) and black pepper, but this version uses bacon, since it\u2019s widely available and lends a nice smoky note. The creamy sauce is created when raw eggs are tossed with the hot pasta (away from direct heat to avoid curdled eggs). This can be tricky, but the method used here is foolproof: Whisk some hot pasta water into the beaten eggs, then drizzle the tempered egg mixture into the pasta while stirring vigorously for a glossy smooth sauce. Tomatoes are not traditional in carbonara, but they lend a bright tang to the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/14/dining/kc-tomato-carbonara/merlin_183521916_f66dbec5-f726-4d92-9f52-80067668a8ca-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "bacon, cherry tomatoes, egg yolks, eggs, parmesan, spaghetti", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1670}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound spaghetti", "2 large eggs plus 4 large egg yolks, at room temperature", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (about 1 1/2 ounces), plus more for serving", "6 ounces thick-cut smoked bacon, cut into 1/4-inch-thick matchsticks", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
