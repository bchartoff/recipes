The chocolate chips are optional, but they add a bittersweet flavor that tones down the sugary coconut, especially if you use chocolate with a high cacao percentage (72 percent to 80 percent). Or, for something crunchier, use chopped pecans instead of chocolate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/26/dining/26apperex2-coconut-1/merlin_211670877_c464a2fa-1d6c-4e5d-a070-a4041a12cb7e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "12 bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bar cookie, coconut milk, food processor, plan-ahead, sweetened coconut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 190}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter, at room temperature, for greasing the pan", "1\u00bd cups/188 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons/25 grams granulated sugar", "\u00bd teaspoon fine sea salt", "\u00be cup/170 grams unsalted butter", "3 large eggs", "1 1/3 cups/267 grams granulated sugar", "\u00bd cup/113 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "\u00bd cup/118 milliliters unsweetened coconut milk or whole milk", "2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar or 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (optional)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "\u00bd teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 packed cup/100 grams shredded sweetened coconut", "1/3 cup/54 grams bittersweet chocolate chips, preferably 72 percent to 80 percent cacao (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
