{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mixed Apples Pie", "description": "This is essentially a classic double-crusted apple pie, packed tight with fruit, but it calls for a wide variety of apples, giving it far more flavor. For the most nuanced filling, use as many different types as possible: A mix of sweet, tart, crunchy and tender apples will yield complex tastes and textures. The sharp acidity of lime juice heightens the tanginess of your blend, half of which should be firm apples to keep the filling from collapsing. To ensure success with the crust, keep the ingredients cold, popping them into the freezer if needed, and work quickly with a gentle touch. A generous layer of spiced cookie crumbs prevents the bottom crust from getting soggy and lends even more warmth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/dining/06pierex/merlin_179623644_e2d1cc90-0e54-43f7-942f-bfef9067d394-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "apple, apple pie, cardamom, cinnamon, cookie crumbs, birthday, christmas, thanksgiving, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 738}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "2 1/3 cups/300 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/225 grams cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), preferably high-fat European-style, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1/3 cup/40 grams spiced cookie crumbs, crushed from crunchy varieties such as Biscoff or gingersnaps", "2/3 cup/130 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/45 grams cornstarch", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 1/2 pounds/1.5 kilograms apples (about 8), a mix of tart, sweet, crunchy and soft varieties such as Granny Smith, Gala, Opal and Jazz, peeled and cored", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice", "2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Whisk sugar and 1/3 cup/80 milliliters water in a small bowl until sugar dissolves, then place in the freezer.
