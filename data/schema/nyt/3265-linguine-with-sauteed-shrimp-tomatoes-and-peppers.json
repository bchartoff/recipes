The recipe may be close to 30 years old, but its flavors and ease of preparation are timeless. First, a quick sauce is made of chopped garlic, red and green bell peppers, canned tomatoes and oregano. As that simmers away, the linguine is dropped into briskly boiling water and cooked for about nine minutes. While the pasta is cooking, the shrimp is saut\u00e9ed with a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes in a little olive oil until it just turns pink. When the shrimp is cooked through, it's combined with the sauce and a handful of chopped fresh basil or Italian flat-leaf parsley then tossed with the linguine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/30/dining/30COOKING-SHRIMP-PASTA1/30COOKING-SHRIMP-PASTA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "dairy-free, nut-free, vegetarian, linguine, shrimp, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 156}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds medium-size shrimp", "3 quarts water", "Salt to taste", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic", "1 medium-size red sweet pepper, cored, seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 medium-size green pepper, cored, seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes", "3 cups canned crushed tomatoes", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "3/4 pound imported linguine", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, if available, or chopped Italian parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel and devein shrimp."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring water with salt to a boil in a large kettle."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the garlic and red and green peppers.
