{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ginger Fried Rice", "description": "This recipe comes to The Times from the fertile mind of the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Like all fried-rice dishes it begins with leftover rice (freshly cooked rice is too moist to fry well). It\u2019s jasmine rice here, but white from Chinese takeout works nearly as well and is more convenient. Perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 this is a chef\u2019s recipe, after all \u2014 separate cooking processes are called for: ginger and garlic are crisped, leeks softened, rice and eggs fried. But no step takes more than a few minutes, and the results are absolutely worth the effort.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/12/dining/12friedrice/12friedrice-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, weeknight, one pot", "keywords": "eggs, rice, gluten-free, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 634}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 371, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "868 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup peanut oil", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "2 tablespoons minced ginger", "Salt", "2 cups thinly sliced leeks, white and light green parts only, rinsed and dried", "4 cups day-old cooked rice, preferably jasmine, at room temperature", "4 large eggs", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "4 teaspoons soy sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup peanut oil over medium heat.
