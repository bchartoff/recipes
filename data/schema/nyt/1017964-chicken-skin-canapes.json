When I first tasted them during a charity event at the stall run by Ken Oringer, a chef and owner of Toro on the edge of SoHo, I kept coming back for more. He said they were easy to make at home. And they are, requiring about an hour of unattended time. Mr. Oringer served his as little sandwiches \u2013 he calls them bocadillas \u2013 filled with a kind of Spanish pimento cheese. I made mine open-faced, with the cheese as a topping. I also used them to channel Buffalo wings by spreading a little hot sauce, then a blue cheese mixture on top and using a slice of celery as a garnish. The skin shrinks as it cooks. Kept in a container or a plastic bag, the unadorned crackers can hold for several days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/03/dining/03BURNER4/03BURNER4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "32 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "crackers and chips", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken skin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8}, "recipeIngredient": ["Skin from 8 chicken thighs", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1 cup <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017965-spanish-pimento-cheese-spread\">Spanish pimento</a> or <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017966-blue-cheese-spread\">blue cheese spread</a>", "32 slices celery, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
