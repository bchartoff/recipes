This simple winter dinner also features carrots, which grow unusually sweet in Alaska's summer light and temperatures, and are a root-cellar staple. Sweet or spicy Italian sausage works well as a substitute for the chorizo.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia O'Malley"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/21/dining/21anchorrex/21anchorrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "\u00a06 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "easy, soups and stews", "keywords": "chorizo, kale, red lentils, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 213}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 406, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "917 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 links fresh (uncured) Mexican-style chorizo, casings removed (1 pound)", "2 tightly packed cups chopped kale", "1 medium onion, chopped", "2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds", "2 stalks celery, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 quarts low-sodium chicken broth", "1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, with juice", "1 cup red lentils", "Crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
