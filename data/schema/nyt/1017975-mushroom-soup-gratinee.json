I swapped out the onions for mushrooms and served the hearty soup paved with a layer of toast and cheese as a cold-weather first course. For an informal supper, it could be the main event, especially with additions like potatoes or other root vegetables, shredded cabbage, cooked lentils, buckwheat pasta or even chunks of duck confit, sausage or\u00a0 boneless short ribs or veal shank. As for the finishing glaze of cheese, I suggest Gruy\u00e8re, though the Bitto of the region, a firm cow\u2019s milk cheese made with a funky touch of goat milk, would be lovely if you can find it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/10/dining/10PAIRING/10PAIRING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "mushroom", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 128}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 669, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "89 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1424 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound cremini mushrooms, very finely minced, as for duxelles", "1 large red onion, sliced thin", "4 cloves garlic, sliced", "1 1/2 pounds shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded, sliced thin", "Salt", "5 cups mushroom or vegetable stock", "1 cup dry red wine", "2 tablespoons red miso", "Ground black pepper to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "6 slices sourdough bread, about 3 inches in diameter", "6 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, shaved thin"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan.
