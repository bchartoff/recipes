{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Toasted Millet Salad With Cucumber, Avocado and Lemon", "description": "Cooked millet has a taste and aroma that\u2019s subtly reminiscent of raw hazelnuts, and as with hazelnuts, toasting millet first really deepens its flavor. If you want to work ahead, toast and cook the millet, set aside and toss in the other ingredients when ready. Sharp mint leaves, creamy avocado, crisp cucumbers and bright lemon really round out this dish, which makes a lovely side dish, an afternoon snack or the base of a protein-focused grain bowl. Millet is marvelous, but a wide variety of grains will work just as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/11/dining/yw-toasted-millet-with-cucumbers-and-avocado/merlin_175298601_933d18cb-36d6-4199-b41e-d14c5da33f0d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice, salads and dressings, main course, side dish", "keywords": "almond, avocado, cucumber, honey, lemon, millet, mint", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 91}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup millet or other grains, such as barley, farro, brown rice or kasha", "Kosher salt", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 tablespoon lemon zest plus 1/4 cup juice", "1 tablespoon honey", "Black pepper", "1 pound English or Persian cucumbers, quartered lengthwise into 1/2-inch spears, then cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces", "1 packed cup mint leaves", "1/4 cup sliced almonds (optional)", "1 avocado, pitted and sliced into quarters"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To a small pot set over medium heat, add the millet and toast, swirling the pan constantly until the grains begin to crackle, become fragrant and deepen in color to a deep tan, about 10 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn heat to low and carefully add 1 1/4 cups water, season with salt, bring to a simmer and cook, partly covered, until the millet is softened, about 15 minutes.
