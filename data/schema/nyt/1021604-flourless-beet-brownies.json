{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Flourless Beet Brownies", "description": "Despite being flourless, these beet brownies bridge the gap between fudgy and cakey, offering the best of both worlds. Raw beets make the brownies dense and moist, helping them stay luscious and soft long after they\u2019ve finished baking. Though the beets bring their own natural sweetness, pulsing the chopped raw beets in a food processor with some additional granulated sugar breaks down the hard root into a vibrant red base. In fact, the food processor does most of the work in this recipe. Baked until just cooked through, the resulting brownies are rich, subtly sweet and deeply chocolatey. If you prefer your brownies a little sweeter, sub the bittersweet chocolate baking chips for semi-sweet baking chips. You can top them with a little flaky sea salt out of the oven. Serve them warm with ice cream for dessert or at room temperature with a cup of coffee in the morning.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/09/dining/jg-beet-brownies/jg-beet-brownies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "9 brownies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "beet, brownie, chocolate chips, cocoa powder, olive oil, vanilla, christmas, new year\u2019s day, super bowl, valentine\u2019s day, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 512}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing", "1 cup/70 grams unsweetened regular or Dutch-process cocoa powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 medium red beet (about 1/4 pound), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract (optional)", "1 cup plus 3 tablespoons/7 ounces bittersweet or dark (60 percent cacao) baking chocolate chips", "2 large eggs", "Flaky sea salt, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
