{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Gnocchi With Burst Tomatoes and Mozzarella", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/dining/gnocchi-recipes.html\">Pan-fried gnocchi</a> is like a faster version of baked pasta. Store-bought gnocchi can simply be browned in a pan for an exciting mix of crispy outsides and chewy middles, no boiling required. This dish is<span> studded with juicy tomatoes and melty pockets of mozzarella. C</span>herry tomatoes are reliably more flavorful year-round than larger, more watery varieties like beefsteak and heirloom. (That said, taste yours, and if they\u2019re more tart than sweet, add 1/2 teaspoon sugar in Step 2.) Toss the tomatoes with browned butter, red-pepper flakes and garlic, then hit them with a little heat, and they\u2019ll burst into a bright sauce. Stir in the gnocchi, dot with mozzarella, then broil until the cheese is molten and the tomatoes are blistered in spots.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/19/dining/as-cheesy-baked-gnocchi/merlin_183955068_cea0bca3-39eb-4a57-a1ce-ba780b08af51-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "brown butter, cherry tomatoes, gnocchi, mozzarella, skillet, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 6977}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 (12- to 18-ounce) packages shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi", "1/4 cup unsalted butter", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 pints small tomatoes, such as cherry, grape or Sungold", "1/4 cup thinly sliced or torn basil leaves (optional), plus more for serving", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut or torn into 1/2-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler with a rack about 6 inches from the heat source."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) skillet on the stovetop, heat enough olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan (about 1 tablespoon) over medium-high.
