The hotel had adapted a recipe used by Gilchrist's, once one of city's best-known department stores. After it ran, a reader wrote in to say that the best blueberry muffins in Boston were not from the Ritz-Carlton, but from the now-closed Jordan Marsh department store. She sent along the recipe, with a description of how she picks wild blueberries: standing in a pond in the August heat and plucking berries from bushes along the bank. This version has a lot more sugar and butter and fewer eggs than the Ritz-Carlton muffins. The recipe also calls for mashing a half cup of berries and adding them to the batter. This produces a very moist muffin, one that will stay fresh longer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Marian Burros"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/03/dining/03COOKING-JORDANMARSHMUFFIN2/03COOKING-JORDANMARSHMUFFIN2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3933}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 260, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "174 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup softened butter", "1 1/4 cups sugar", "2 eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 cup milk", "2 cups blueberries, washed, drained and picked over", "3 teaspoons sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cream the butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar until light."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
