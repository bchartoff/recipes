{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oyakodon (Japanese Chicken and Egg Rice Bowl)", "description": "Oyakodon, a soupy rice bowl with bite-size chicken and softly cooked egg, is often overshadowed by its more glamorous cousins \u2014 katsudon, crowned with a golden breaded pork cutlet, and kaisendon, jeweled with sashimi. But to describe oyakodon's layered textures and sweet-salty sauce of onions melting in soy, sake and mirin, the word magical comes up again and again. This recipe, more subtly seasoned than you might find in a Tokyo cafeteria, comes from the photographer Mika Horie, who grew up cooking it with her mother in Kyoto. It calls for cooking the eggs and chicken in two batches. You can cook all of it at once in a larger skillet, but the results won\u2019t be as pretty.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hannah Kirshner"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/dining/hannah-oyakodon-horizontal/merlin_141075420_edfc0f4f-ba70-4542-a881-085a9dc162b9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, quick, snack, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 504}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 540, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1199 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons dashi (homemade or instant)", "2 tablespoons dry sake", "2 tablespoons mirin or aji mirin", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoons sugar", "2 skin-on chicken thighs, deboned (do it yourself or ask your butcher)", "1 small onion, thinly sliced, lengthwise", "4 eggs", "6 sprigs of mitsuba, cut into 1-inch lengths, or 2 scallions, very thinly sliced on a sharp diagonal", "Short-grained white <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019204-basic-stovetop-rice\">rice</a> (often labeled sushi rice), cooked, for serving", "Shichimi togarashi (Japanese 7-spice chile pepper, sometimes labeled nanami) (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a small bowl, combine dashi, sake, mirin, soy sauce and sugar; stir to dissolve sugar.
