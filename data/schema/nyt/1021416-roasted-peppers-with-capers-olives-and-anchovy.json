The flames of an outdoor grill, stovetop burner or broiler add a touch of smokiness, while helping to remove a pepper\u2019s tough skin. To prevent the pepper from overcooking, do not place it in a closed container after roasting, as some suggest \u2014 just let it cool uncovered on a plate. The skin will still come off and the flesh won\u2019t be mushy. The combination of sweet pepper and salty anchovy is classic. Serve this carpaccio-style, using a whole pepper to cover the plate, or arrange in alternating rows.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/16/dining/11Tanisrex1-peppers/merlin_176678550_0212e0d6-938a-4364-8836-550698dc4f80-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, vegetables, appetizer", "keywords": "anchovies, capers, olives, red pepper, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 red bell or other large sweet peppers, such as Corno di Toro", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1 small garlic clove, grated", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "12 anchovy fillets, rinsed and blotted", "1 teaspoon capers", "12 black olives", "Basil leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Roast the\u00a0peppers: Place each pepper directly on the flames of a\u00a0stovetop burner\u00a0or\u00a0under the\u00a0broiler as close to the flames as possible.\u00a0(Alternatively, place the pepper on a hot charcoal or gas grill.)
