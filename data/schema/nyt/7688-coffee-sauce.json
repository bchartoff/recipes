Shake the pan and lightly toast the coffee beans and spices, about 10 minutes. Add the molasses and cook until it bubbles intensely and thickly coats the beans. Pour in the white wine and chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Reduce by one-third. Strain the sauce into another saucepan, then whisk in the espresso, sour cream and butter. Cook for a minute or two. (Don't let it boil.) Season to taste with salt and pepper. When ready to serve, reheat gently and, if you have one, buzz it with an immersion blender to make it frothy."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7688-coffee-sauce"}
