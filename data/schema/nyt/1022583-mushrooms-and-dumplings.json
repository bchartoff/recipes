{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushrooms and Dumplings", "description": "This hearty vegetarian riff on chicken and dumplings uses meaty fresh mushrooms and concentrated dried mushrooms to quickly build layers of rich flavor. Dried shiitakes, normally rehydrated before using, are grated into a fine powder that dissolves and fortifies the broth with intense mushroom umami. Make the dumpling mixture while the stew cooks and allow it to rest in the fridge for more tender dumplings. Once simmered, they emerge light and spongy on the outside, and slightly chewy on the inside. \n\nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/13/dining/kc-mushroom-and-dumplings/kc-mushroom-and-dumplings-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 Servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, dumplings, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "cremini, dried mushrooms, dutch oven, mushroom stock, shiitake, white mushrooms, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1279}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 medium leeks (1 pound), white and light green parts only, thinly sliced (2 cups)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 pound small white button or cremini mushrooms, quartered (5 1/2 cups)", "8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced (about 3 cups)", "2 carrots, thinly sliced (1 cup)", "3 dried shiitake mushrooms, grated on a Microplane and stems discarded (1/3 cup)", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "4 cups mushroom broth", "3 thyme sprigs", "2 tablespoons heavy cream or whole milk", "Chopped chives, for garnish", "1 1/2 cups/205 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 large egg", "1/2 cup/120 grams whole milk", "3 tablespoons/45 grams butter, melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the mushrooms: In a large Dutch oven, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high.
