At the time, he said: \u201cA genuine pozole is a tedious but incredibly simple food, rather like a hearty soup, made of pork and hominy (the dried kernels of corn). It is served with the cooking liquid plus assorted garnishes, including chopped onion, ground hot chilies, sliced radishes, shredded lettuce and lime wedges, which are passed at the table and added according to taste.\u201d Which doesn\u2019t sound tedious at all. Still, he designed this recipe so that it could be cooked within an hour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 603, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "50 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "2297 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pork chops, about 1 1/2 pounds", "2 chicken legs plus thighs, about 1 1/2 pounds", "6 cups water", "1 onion, about 1/4 pound, peeled and quartered", "1 large clove garlic, peeled", "Salt to taste if desired", "2 tablespoons chopped hot green chilies, optional (see note)", "12 peppercorns", "2 1/2 cups drained canned hominy, available in shops and supermarkets that deal in Spanish and Puerto Rican foods", "1 small head iceberg lettuce", "12 radishes", "1 lime", "1/2 cup finely chopped Bermuda onion"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut bones from chops but reserve both meat and bones.
