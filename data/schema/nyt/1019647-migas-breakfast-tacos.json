Set into scrambled eggs that are loaded with onions and poblanos, they soften and enrich the mix while keeping some crispiness. A slice of avocado on top \u2014 along with melted cheese \u2014 adds a nice creaminess to the mix. These tacos work well with red or green salsa, so use your favorite. While these would impress at a weekend brunch, they also come together quickly on weekday mornings, and can be wrapped in foil to be eaten out of hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/dining/gk-migas-tacos-horizontal/gk-migas-tacos-horizontal-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, quick, snack, weekday", "keywords": "avocado, cilantro, eggs, pepper jack cheese, poblano pepper, tortilla, tortilla chips, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 436}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "374 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large eggs", "Kosher salt", "6 corn tortillas", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 cup tortilla chips, broken if very large", "1/2 cup diced onion", "1 cup diced, seeded poblano pepper", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "2 ounces pepper jack cheese, grated (3/4 cup)", "1/2 avocado, pitted, peeled and sliced", "Salsa, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Beat the eggs with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat.
