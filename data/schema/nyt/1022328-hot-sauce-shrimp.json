Because most include vinegar and salt in addition to chiles, all hot sauce needs to become a silky pan sauce is fat. That\u2019s the approach used in this super-quick recipe, which tastes like a cross between <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019952-baked-buffalo-wings\">Buffalo chicken wings</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018467-chile-shrimp\">chile shrimp</a>.\u00a0After charring some scallions in the skillet, shrimp are cooked until plump and pink, then both are tossed with butter and hot sauce until glossy. Because hot sauces vary greatly in terms of heat, start with one tablespoon, then add more as you wish. If it\u2019s too spicy for you, add more butter, or serve it with rice, crusty bread, beer, yogurt or ranch dressing to cut the heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/18/dining/as-hot-sauce-shrimp/merlin_189371910_1174ecff-815b-4920-be6d-180388d73882-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "hot sauce, scallion, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1003}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined or shell-on\u00a0", "Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cubed", "1 tablespoon hot sauce, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons neutral oil (like vegetable or grapeseed), plus more as needed", "6 scallions, trimmed, white and green parts cut crosswise into 1-inch segments"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the shrimp dry and season with 1 teaspoon salt.
