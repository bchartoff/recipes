{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ricotta Tart With Lemon Poppy Crust", "description": "This simple, not-too-sweet tart is reminiscent of a cheesecake but with a higher crust-to-filling ratio. If you\u2019ve got excellent, ripe fruit, feel free to lay it on top \u2014 berries, figs, poached rhubarb or pears, pineapple, plums \u2014 anything sweet and juicy will contrast nicely with the milky ricotta filling. Or just drizzle the tart with good flavorful honey and serve it plain. It\u2019s an elegant way to end a meal.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t a poppy seed fan, just leave them out of the crust. Or substitute sesame seeds instead for a similar crunch, if different flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20TART_SUB/20TART_SUB-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, pies and tarts", "keywords": "almonds, mascarpone, poppy seeds, ricotta, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 330}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 405, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "158 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/185 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/50 grams blanched sliced almonds", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Grated zest of 1 lemon", "Pinch kosher salt", "1/2 cup/113 grams/1 stick unsalted butter, cold and cubed", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "1 tablespoon/10 grams poppy seeds", "1/4 cup/55 grams mascarpone", "1/4 cup/50 grams sugar", "1/8 teaspoon/1 gram cinnamon", "1 3/4 cups/400 grams ricotta", "1 large egg plus 1 large egg white", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters good strong honey, more for drizzling (optional)", "1/8 teaspoon/1 gram kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the tart shell: Place 1/4 cup/31 grams of flour and the almonds in a food processor with the blade attachment.
