{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Swiss Chard Slab Pie", "description": "This crowd-pleasing recipe by Justin Chapple comes from Kristin Donnelly's book \"Modern Potluck\" and makes the most of Swiss chard, using both leaves and stems to fill a vegetarian slab pie with a buttery, peppery crust. That filling, tangy with reduced white wine and bound with sour cream, tastes just as good warm as it does cold, and can feed a crowd any time of day. Note: Wash leaves and stems thoroughly to avoid any traces of grit in the finished pie.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28MODERN1/28MODERN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pies and tarts", "keywords": "main course, swiss chard, white wine, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 229}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 510, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "640 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/360 grams all-purpose flour, more for dusting work surface", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 1/4 cups/283 grams cold unsalted butter (2 1/2 sticks), cubed", "2/3 cup ice water", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large red onion, finely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1 tablespoon ground ginger", "Pinch red pepper flakes", "3 pounds/1.4 kilograms red Swiss chard, stems separated and cut into 1/4-inch pieces, leaves roughly chopped", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters dry white wine", "3/4 cup/168 grams sour cream", "Black pepper, to taste", "1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a food processor, pulse flour with salt and pepper.
