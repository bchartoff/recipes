{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Striped Bass with Fresh Figs", "description": "This recipe is inspired by a dish served at a pinot noir dinner at Bar Boulud, one of the chef Daniel Boulud\u2019s restaurants. There, a whole wild striped bass was swaddled in fresh fig leaves and stuffed with fresh black figs in a red wine sauce. The brooding sauce bathed velvet figs, and its earthy depths made the already succulent fish a fine partner for some excellent bottles of red. My version, which uses fillets and omits fig leaves, is about as delicious as I remembered and much easier than I expected.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/11/dining/11pairrex/11pairrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "black figs, dry red wine, wild striped bass, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 19}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 578, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1185 milligrams", "sugarContent": "47 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "2 large shallots, sliced thin", "1 large clove garlic, slivered", "16 ripe black figs, not too soft, stemmed and halved vertically", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "3 tablespoons saba (Italian grape-must syrup); or pomegranate molasses", "3/4 cup dry red wine", "3 1/2 tablespoons soft unsalted butter, preferably high fat (84-86 percent)", "Salt and ground black pepper", "28- to 30-ounce fillet of wild striped bass, with skin, or halibut", "1 tablespoon flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet on medium heat.
