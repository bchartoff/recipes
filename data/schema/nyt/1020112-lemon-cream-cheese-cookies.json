{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Cream Cheese Cookies", "description": "Chewy and sweet, these simple cookies are heavenly with a cup of tea \u2014 and a lavish dose of fresh lemon zest provides some pluck. Cream cheese is the star ingredient in both the cookie and its glaze, and performs two tasks: It imparts tanginess and contributes to the soft texture. These cookies are simple but delicate, so you\u2019ll want to pull them from the oven as soon as they begin to turn golden, then let them cool directly on the baking sheets until they firm up. The glaze is optional, but it\u2019s easy to whip together while the cookies cool.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/dining/ss-lemon-cookies/ss-lemon-cookies-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "1 1/2 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, lemon, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 311}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 148, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "96 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick), at room temperature", "4 ounces/105 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 lemon, zested and juiced (about 4 teaspoons zest and 2 tablespoons juice)", "1 large egg", "3 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons milk, plus more, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
