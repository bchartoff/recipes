As all cooks (and writers) know, Thanksgiving is an adventure and a challenge: how to come up with fresh ideas that keep the dish on the right side of tradition? In this pie, Mrs. Child\u2019s addition of molasses, extra spices and especially bourbon breathe new life into the filling. If you like your desserts on the spicy side, add an extra tablespoon of molasses and a pinch of black pepper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/18/dining/19JULIAREX3/19JULIAREX3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Two 9-inch pies, 16 to 20 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, heavy cream, pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 521}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 285, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "303 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 eggs", "2 15-ounce cans (3 1/2 cups) pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "1 cup light brown sugar", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons molasses", "3 tablespoons bourbon or dark rum (optional)", "3 teaspoons cinnamon", "3 teaspoons ginger", "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon cloves", "1 cup heavy cream", "3/4 cup milk, more as needed", "2 unbaked 9-inch pie shells, or one 11-inch pie shell (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-all-butter-pie-crust\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees and place rack in center of oven.
