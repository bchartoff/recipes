Mr. Claiborne, it turns out, hadn\u2019t.\n\u201cMy dictionary informs me that monkey bread is the gourdlike fruit of the baobab tree,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/24/garden/q-a-252366.html\">he wrote</a>.\nA couple of weeks (and \u201cnumerous\u201d letters and phone calls) later, he corrected himself, running this recipe from James Beard\u2019s 1973 book \u201cBeard on Bread.\u201d We've retested the recipe, and made a couple of updates. It\u2019s still a little different from many of the pull-apart breads you may find online, and a showstopper. Its crispy, buttery edges are almost like sweeter dinner rolls, giving way to caramelized, gooey bits at the bottom.
