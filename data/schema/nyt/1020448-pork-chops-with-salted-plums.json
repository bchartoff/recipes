{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Chops With Salted Plums", "description": "This weeknight affair pairs savory pork with a sweet-and-sour mixture of sliced plums and red onions. When a recipe has so few ingredients, it\u2019s important that they be of the highest quality possible. The pork chops here will deliver most of the fat, so make sure they\u2019re well marbled (bone-in loin or rib chops both work). As for the plums, this is one of the rare occasions in which underripe is preferred to perfectly ripe, so they maintain texture after they get briefly tossed in the skillet, and also deliver plenty of acidity for the pan sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/dining/09Romanrex/merlin_156252630_4ec6d8aa-e1d1-4761-aa2a-9bdbfb17cd06-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, meat", "keywords": "fall, summer, main course, plums, pork chops, red onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 298}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 bone-in pork chops (1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch thick, about 1 1/2 pounds total)", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "1 pound medium plums, pitted and sliced", "1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup unseasoned rice wine vinegar or fresh lime juice, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon fish sauce (optional)", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "1 cup fresh mint leaves", "Olive oil, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season pork with salt and pepper; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the plums and onion in a medium bowl along with vinegar and fish sauce, if using.
