{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chebureki", "description": "Chebureki are the southern Ukrainian branch of the global family of empanadas, potstickers, pasties and\u00a0salte\u00f1as \u2014 dough pockets filled with meat and deep-fried until golden and juicy. A blistered, chewy crust is the sign of a really good cheburek according to Olga Koutseridi, who grew up in Mariupol, Ukraine, and adapted this recipe for her home kitchen in Austin, Texas. The dough for this recipe is relatively stiff, which means it will take a bit of time to mix it by hand. You could also use a stand mixer, but your mixer may struggle. After the first few, these pies become much easier to assemble, and you can roll and fill the next one while one is frying. It is best to fry one or two at a time, which helps control the oil temperature and ensures the freshest chebureki. They should be eaten within just a few minutes of their emergence from the fryer.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/16/dining/16UKRAINIAN-RECIPESREX1-update/16UKRAINIAN-RECIPESREX1-update-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "12 chebureki", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, pastries, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "ground beef, ground pork, kefir", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 147}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium onion, any kind (except sweet), coarsely chopped\u00a0", "4 ounces ground beef", "4 ounces ground pork", "2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt\u00a0", "8 ounces plain kefir, plus more as needed", "4 cups/510 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (if needed)", "1 teaspoon fine salt", "1 cup/240 milliliters plus 1 tablespoon cold water", "Peanut oil or refined sunflower oil, for frying (about 8 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the meat filling: Place the chopped onion in a food processor and process until it is very fine and has started to release moisture.
