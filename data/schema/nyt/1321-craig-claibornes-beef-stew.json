{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Craig Claiborne's Beef Stew", "description": "It would be hard to find a simpler meal than Mr. Claiborne\u2019s hearty beef stew, which goes beautifully with buttered noodles and a stout glass of red wine. (Or, for the children, a glass of milk.) A small scattering of cloves adds a floral note to the gravy, augmented by just a little thyme, and the combination pairs beautifully with the carrots you add near the end of the cooking process, to prevent them from going mushy in the heat. Sprinkle chopped parsley over the finished dish, of course, a nod to the past that rewards in beauty and flavor alike.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Craig Claiborne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/dining/beefstew/beefstew-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, times classics", "keywords": "dry red wine, steak, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2563}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 745, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "45 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1257 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds lean, boneless chuck steak", "1/4 cup olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic", "2 cups coarsely chopped onions", "6 tablespoons flour", "4 cups dry red wine", "2 cups water", "4 whole cloves", "1 bay leaf", "1/2 teaspoon thyme", "6 sprigs parsley, tied in a bundle", "6 large carrots, about 1 1/2 pounds, trimmed and scraped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the meat into two-inch cubes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a large skillet, heat the oil and add the beef cubes in one layer.
