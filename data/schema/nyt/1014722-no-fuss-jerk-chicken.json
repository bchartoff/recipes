The pungent marinade includes lots of allspice (called pimento in the islands), black pepper and clove, but gets an even bigger kick from ultra-spicy yellow Scotch bonnet peppers, similar in shape and intensity to habanero chiles. You can certainly grill it in the island manner. But this easy recipe puts the chicken in the oven instead, which fills the kitchen with intoxicating flavors. Vacation on a plate.
