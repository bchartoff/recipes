{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Glass Noodles With Shrimp and Spicy Mustard Sauce", "description": "The secret pantry ingredient in this superfast, superflavorful noodle dish is Asian hot mustard powder. Mixed with equal parts water, the golden powder blooms into a pungent, spicy sauce. The noodles can be made a few hours ahead and served chilled or at room temperature. They will develop more flavor as they sit, though you should remove from the refrigerator 15 minutes before serving so that the noodles return to room temperature and soften. Jumbo shrimp cook in just a couple minutes, but precooked shrimp are also a convenient option. Eggs add a nice creamy texture that helps tame the hot mustard.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/07/dining/kc-shrimp-glass-noodles/merlin_195007077_ef07fbdb-d1e0-43af-838b-1ae712e4d6b4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, noodles, seafood, main course", "keywords": "glass noodles, mustard powder, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 445}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces dried sweet potato noodles (glass noodles)", "1 pound peeled and deveined jumbo shrimp (about 20)", "2 tablespoons hot Asian mustard powder", "6 tablespoons distilled white vinegar", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "6 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced", "1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and very thinly sliced", "Sliced scallions, for garnish", "4 hard-boiled eggs, halved, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot of boiling water, cook noodles according to package directions until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes.
