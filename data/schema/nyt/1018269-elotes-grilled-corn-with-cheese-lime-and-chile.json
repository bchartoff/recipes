{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Elotes (Grilled Corn With Cheese, Lime and Chile)", "description": "Whole ears of corn are a classic street food in Mexico, where they are either grilled or boiled, then often dressed with some combination of lime, chile, mayonnaise and grated cheese. This grilled version calls for all of the above, which get mixed together into a creamy, bracing topping, and slathered all over the hot, sweet ears. It's not strictly traditional, but it does make it easier to assemble the corn and its dressing before serving. Or place the various topping in small bowls and let guests have the fun of garnishing their own. And if you don\u2019t have a grill, the broiler works too though watch the ears carefully so they don\u2019t burn.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/25/multimedia/clark-grilled-corn/clark-grilled-corn-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, barbecues, side dish", "keywords": "ancho chili powder, corn, cotija, mayonnaise, fourth of july, labor day, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 473}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 237, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "407 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ears fresh corn, shucked", "3 tablespoons mayonnaise", "2 limes", "1/4 teaspoon ancho chile powder, more as needed", "Fine sea salt, as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "1/2 cup crumbed cotija cheese (or substitute feta or ricotta salata)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat your grill to medium-high.
