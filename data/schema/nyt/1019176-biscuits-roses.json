{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Biscuits Roses", "description": "Guillaume Portier, a pastry instructor at La Cuisine Paris cooking school, encouraged me as I was trying to recreate Biscuits Rose de Reims, pink sugar-topped cookies that were once dipped into champagne, the most famous export from the French city of Reims.  I kept making delicious cookies, but none of my batches matched the storebought, which used ammonium carbonate (best known as smelling salts) to give them crackle and shelf-life.  Guillaume told me to stop striving for a replica, reminding me that if what we baked at home lasted forever, we\u2019d be deprived of the pleasure of making pastries again and again.  These cookies will hold for a week or so if you keep them in a sealed tin.  After that, you can look forward to the pleasure of making another batch.  A word on piping: If you don\u2019t have a piping bag, use a zipper-lock plastic bag.  Fill with batter, seal and cut a 1-inch diameter opening in a corner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/11/magazine/11mag-ondessert/11mag-11ondessert-t_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "About 16 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "baking powder, baking soda, cornstarch, eggs, flour, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 80, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "53 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup (90 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup (45 grams) cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "Pinch of salt", "2 large eggs, at room temperature, separated", "1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar, divided", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "Red food coloring, optional", "1/2 cup (60 grams) confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350.
