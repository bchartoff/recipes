{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet and Spicy Roast Chicken", "description": "A chile-flecked, honey-imbued marinade spiked with fresh citrus juice gives this chicken its fiery, syrupy character. Dates and carrots give the sauce texture and additional sweetness while a garnish of fresh herbs and pistachio nuts lends freshness and crunch. It\u2019s dinner party food at its most flavorful and convenient; its honey marinade makes it a particularly wonderful main course for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. The ingredients can be assembled up to 24 hours in advance, then all you need to do is pop it in the oven just before your guests arrive, and garnish it at the last minute. Serve it with couscous, polenta, rice or another soft grain to soak up the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/10/multimedia/clark-sweet-sour-chicken/clark-sweet-sour-chicken-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "carrots, chicken, dates, honey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2585}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 672, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1014 milligrams", "sugarContent": "30 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon, plus 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more for pot", "3 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 tablespoons whole grain mustard", "3 tablespoons honey", "1 bay leaf", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, to taste", "Black pepper, to taste", "1 4-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces", "3 cups sliced carrots (1/4-inch thick)", "1 onion, halved and thinly sliced", "2/3 cup sliced dates", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro or parsley, for garnish", "2 scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish", "1/4 cup chopped toasted pistachio nuts, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Quarter the lemon lengthwise, removing any seeds.
