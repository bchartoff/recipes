{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tomato-Green Bean Salad With Chickpeas, Feta and Dill", "description": "This is a perfect salad for summer, when the market is chockablock with great produce. Use whatever tomatoes are sweetest, and feel free to add yellow wax beans or romano beans in addition to green beans. If your market has fresh shelling beans, use those instead of chickpeas. Plan ahead to soak dried chickpeas overnight. With a soak, they only take an hour to cook, and taste better than canned ones.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/07/dining/02Tanisrex1-salad/02Tanisrex1-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer", "keywords": "chickpea, feta, green beans, tomatoes, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 842}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 pound green beans, preferably slender haricots verts, trimmed", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, from 1 small lemon", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "1 garlic clove, minced", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pint cherry tomatoes, mixed colors, halved", "2 cups cooked chickpeas (from 1 cup dried chickpeas or 1 15-ounce can), cooled and drained", "4 ounces feta, crumbled (1/2 cup)", "2 to 3 tablespoons roughly chopped dill, for serving", "Pinch of dried oregano, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium saucepan of water to boil over high heat.
