{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Chermoula Shrimp and Orzo", "description": "Traditionally used to season seafood and vegetables, chermoula is a Moroccan marinade made of herbs and spices like cilantro, parsley, paprika and cumin. In this one-pot recipe, the orzo cooks in a combination of chermoula and stock, so the orzo is seasoned all the way through. In the last few minutes of cooking, just stir the shrimp into the orzo to cook, and you have a quick and easy, yet exciting, dinner. Feel free to use a protein of your choice instead of shrimp, but adjust cook times accordingly. Also, consider making a big batch of chermoula and keep it in the fridge to use as a marinade, a dressing on salads or a condiment for sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nargisse Benkabbou"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/06/dining/06nb-one-pot-chermoula-shrimp-and-orzo/merlin_207648036_e10df718-8bda-41de-9b39-41f68bb7e7fa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, pastas, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, orzo, parsley, shrimp, healthy", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1081}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 lemons", "1 cup finely chopped cilantro\u00a0", "1 cup finely chopped flat leaf parsley", "1/4 cup olive oil", "3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped", "2 teaspoons paprika", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar\u00a0\u00a0", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon olive oil\u00a0", "1 cup orzo", "1 1/2 cups vegetable stock\u00a0", "3/4 pound peeled and deveined medium to large shrimp, tails removed\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chermoula: Finely grate the zest from both lemons and set aside for serving, then, into a medium bowl, squeeze 2 tablespoons lemon juice.
