{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom and Cottage Cheese Pasta", "description": "This low-effort, intensely flavored pasta dish highlights the earthiness of mushrooms. First, the mushrooms are cooked to release moisture and to concentrate their flavor, then they are pur\u00e9ed into a velvety sauce. Cremini mushrooms are an excellent choice because they are accessible and have a bold mushroom taste, but other varieties also work. For even more mushroom flavor, add a few shiitake mushrooms or a small handful of rehydrated dried porcinis. Cottage cheese is perhaps the most underappreciated of the supermarket fresh cheeses. The curds melt through this pasta to add a feathery light, mildly sweet creaminess.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/23/dining/hm-Mushroom-and-Cottage-Cheese-Pasta/merlin_216141078_3a19f9e4-d6b5-4035-bb47-f0a4499ca9f1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "cottage cheese, cremini, penne, rigatoni, healthy, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 549}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds cremini mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and roughly chopped (about 6 cups)", "1 yellow or red onion, roughly chopped (about 2 cups)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "1 pound short pasta, such as rigatoni, penne or cavatappi", "1 cup full-fat cottage cheese, plus more for serving", "1/2 lemon", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (or to taste)", "Handful of parsley leaves, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high.
