{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Laurie Colwin\u2019s Creamed Spinach With Jalape\u00f1o Peppers", "description": "This recipe is from the celebrated food writer Laurie Colwin, and in some ways it is quintessentially hers. There\u2019s the delicious richness of the dish, its unfussiness and nostalgic value. There is the constant awareness of the plight of the busy home cook, those who would just as soon use a package of frozen spinach if the results are just as good as if you washed and chopped an untold number of bunches of fresh spinach yourself. And there is a twist: the jalape\u00f1os, which are a preventative measure against the gloppy blandness of steakhouse creamed spinach, adding sharpness to the dish but not too much heat. You can use either fresh or pickled jalape\u00f1os here \u2014 the latter add nice zing \u2014 and panko bread crumbs are a good substitution for fresh if you don\u2019t have them (or a few pieces of stale bread) in the pantry.
