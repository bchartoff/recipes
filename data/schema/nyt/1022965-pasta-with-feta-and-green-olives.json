{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Feta and Green Olives", "description": "Bold, briny and tangy, this 15-minute pasta is full of personality. Olives are first slightly blistered in oil, drawing out their brininess, then crumbled feta is stirred into the pasta at the end until melty. Keep the feta chunky when breaking it apart so that the squares become soft and creamy, tasting almost baked. Castelvetrano olives are best here for their meaty texture and gentle flavor, but you can also use your preferred olive. Smash them with the flat side of a chef\u2019s knife \u2014 or even the heel of your palm in a pinch \u2014 then use your fingers to pluck the olive flesh off the pit. Any stubborn meat clinging to the pit is fair game to be eaten then and there.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/07/dining/yf-feta-and-olive-pasta/yf-feta-and-olive-pasta-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "cavatappi, feta, green olives, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1265}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 pound dried cavatappi, fusilli or other short, curly noodle", "1/3 cup olive oil", "12 ounces green olives, such as Castelvetrano or Cerignola, smashed and pitted", "1 garlic clove, grated or minced", "1 lemon, zested and juiced (about 1 tablespoon zest and 3 tablespoons juice)", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as desired", "1/2 to \u00be cup loosely crumbled or cubed feta, depending on preference", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
