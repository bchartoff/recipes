{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Carrots With Yaji Spice Relish", "description": "A fragrant combination of dried spices and aromatics, yaji, also known as suya spice, is as ubiquitous as salt and pepper in homes across Northern Nigeria and West Africa more broadly. Often used to cure meats and finish other dishes, the spice blend is made depending on taste and access to ingredients, so the recipe can range from home to home and vendor to vendor. Common among blends is the addition of a warming chile powder, ground ginger (although fresh is used in some cases) and pulverized peanuts. Here, a basic yaji spice blend is incorporated into a fresh, piquant relish of scallions, lemon zest and juice as a finish to liven up roast vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/27/dining/27komolaferex/merlin_194895609_d25af3f5-bbc3-43fe-bd79-7f86bf11f149-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "carrot, ginger, peanut, scallion, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 289}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds carrots, scrubbed, cut into 3- to 4-inch pieces, halved lengthwise if thick", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable oil", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 (1 1/2-inch) piece fresh ginger, scrubbed", "1 cup thinly sliced scallions (from about 5 scallions)", "2 lemons", "1 tablespoon roasted peanut oil (optional)", "1 tablespoon yaji spice (see Tip)", "1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley", "1/4 cup toasted unsalted peanuts, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
