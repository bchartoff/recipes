Cognac anchors the drink, fresh lime brightens it, and a simple syrup steeped with ginger, cinnamon, clove and cardamom evokes a classic mulled wine. The simple syrup here makes extra and keeps for a month in the refrigerator. Add it to lemonade, drizzle it over oatmeal or substitute it for standard simple syrup in another cocktail to make it automatically cozy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/dining/16toddyrex2/merlin_178199865_c4142512-6265-45e5-953e-e0a7e1e13643-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cognac, ginger, lime juice, red wine, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 90}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (5- to 6-inch) piece ginger", "2 cinnamon sticks, lightly crushed", "4 whole cloves", "4 whole black peppercorns", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "5 whole green cardamom pods, lightly crushed", "Ice", "1 1/2 ounces dry red wine, such as Pinot Noir, Gamay, or Grenache", "1 ounce Cognac", "1/2 ounce sweet vermouth", "1/2 ounce fresh lime juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a coupe glass in the freezer to chill for at least 15 minutes and up to an hour.
