Though it\u2019s delicious on its own, this dish can serve as a blank canvas. For quick, easy upgrades, stir in 1 cup of frozen peas or 1 pound of cleaned shrimp during the last few minutes of cooking, or top the risotto with whatever cooked seasonal vegetables you desire.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/07/dining/kc-risotto/kc-risotto-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 side servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "arborio rice, chicken broth, dry white wine, parmesan, risotto", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 272}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken (or vegetable) broth", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup minced shallot (from 1 medium shallot)", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 cup arborio or carnaroli rice", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for garnish", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, bring broth to a simmer over medium, then reduce heat to lowest setting to keep warm."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium.
