{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Olive Oil Challah", "description": "Made with extra-virgin olive oil, this challah is especially rich and complex tasting. A little bit of grated citrus zest, if you choose to use it, adds a welcome brightness to the soft, slightly sweet loaf, which is also flavored with orange juice. (Don't use store-bought orange juice with preservatives; it can inhibit yeast growth. It\u2019s best to squeeze the oranges yourself.) If you\u2019d prefer a more classic challah, substitute a neutral oil such as safflower or grapeseed for the olive oil and leave out the zest.\nThis recipe makes one large loaf (about 1 pound). Feel free to double it if you\u2019re feeding a crowd or if you\u2019d like to toss one loaf into the freezer, where it will keep well for up to 3 months.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/21/dining/21APPE-CHALLAH/21APPE-CHALLAH-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H40M", "recipeYield": "1 loaf", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "bread flour, orange juice, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 730}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 252, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "177 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/118 milliliters fresh orange juice at room temperature (from about 2 medium oranges; see tip)", "2 1/4 teaspoons/1/4 ounce/7 grams active dry yeast (1 packet)", "1/3 cup/78 milliliters olive oil", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 large egg yolk, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons/37 grams sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon grated orange or lemon zest, to taste (optional)", "3 to 3 1/2 cups/360 to 420 grams bread flour, plus more for kneading dough"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine orange juice and 1 tablespoon water.

To braid it into a round loaf, first lay three ropes parallel to one another on the work surface, leaving 1 inch between them. Take one of the remaining ropes and hold it perpendicular to the three ropes, across the center. Weave that rope through the three ropes, as if you were creating a lattice for a pie; leave the edges free. Repeat with remaining two ropes. The resulting shape should look somewhat like a pound or number sign, but with a woven center. Then, starting from the ends of the three ropes closest to you, braid the loose edges of the ropes and pinch the ends together. Repeat with the remaining ends of the ropes; you should end up with a lattice in the middle with 4 braids radiating out from it. Tuck the braids underneath the lattice to create a round loaf, place on a small rimmed baking sheet, then brush with egg wash.
