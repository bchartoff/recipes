If you don't have the time to dry-brine, don't. You'll still end up with one of the best roast chickens you've ever had. Just dry the bird really well with paper towels before seasoning and dab it again before putting it into the sizzling pan. Rodgers\u2019s technique, which involves drying and seasoning the chicken, then flipping it while cooking, results in a wonderfully browned bird, with crackling skin and moist meat. Serve it over a <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10721-warm-bread-salad\">bread salad</a>, as she did, or with well-dressed greens and a baguette.
