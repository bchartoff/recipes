It\u2019s based on a recipe for a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018315-breton-tuna-and-white-bean-gratin\">Breton tuna and white bean gratin</a> from the food writer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/dining/diana-henry-simple-cookbook.html\">Diana Henry\u2019s</a> cookbook, \u201cSimple\u201d (Mitchell Beazley, 2016). Several steps were eliminated, and an essential potato chip topping was added, which may put it squarely into tuna casserole territory. But you can call it whatever you like.
