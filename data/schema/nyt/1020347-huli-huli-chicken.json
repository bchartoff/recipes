{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Huli Huli Chicken", "description": "In 1955, Ernest Morgado, a Honolulu businessman, served a group of farmers grilled chicken that had been marinated in his mother\u2019s teriyaki-style sauce. It was such a hit that he decided to market it with the name \u201chuli huli.\u201d Huli means \u201cturn\u201d in Hawaiian and refers to how it\u2019s prepared: grilled between two racks and turned halfway through cooking. This simplified version calls for chicken pieces and a standard grill. The original recipe is a trade secret, but you can find many slightly different variations on the internet, typically including ginger, garlic, soy sauce, something sweet (honey, brown sugar or maple syrup) and something acidic (vinegar, white wine, lime juice or pineapple juice). This recipe is adapted from \u201cAloha Kitchen: Recipes from Hawai\u2018i\u201d by Alana Kysar (Ten Speed, March 2019). It also works beautifully with boneless chicken thighs, but adjust your cooking time accordingly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/17/dining/ml-hulihuli-chicken/ml-hulihuli-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, barbecue", "recipeCategory": "dinner, barbecues, poultry", "keywords": "brown sugar, chicken, ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, fall, summer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1783}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup ketchup", "1/2 cup soy sauce", "1/2 cup packed light or dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated", "2 to 3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated", "3 1/2 to 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces", "Grapeseed or canola oil, for brushing the grill grate"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl or a gallon-size resealable plastic bag, combine the ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, ginger and garlic, and stir or shake until combined.
