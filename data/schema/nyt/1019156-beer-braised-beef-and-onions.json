{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beer-Braised Beef and Onions", "description": "This hearty, warming beef and onion stew is flavored with Belgian beer, bay leaves and sweet paprika. A variation on a traditional Flemish carbonnade, it\u2019s rich and homey but still lively, with a ruddy color from the paprika. The very large quantity of onions adds sweetness, and also helps make the sauce velvety soft. Serve it over potatoes, noodles or polenta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/31/dining/31appetite3/merlin_132677150_c909c0b9-1b5e-44c1-a693-54e51244c542-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "belgian, french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef, beer, onion, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 494}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 317, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "746 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1 teaspoon black pepper, more for garnish", "6 bay leaves", "2 teaspoons sweet paprika, more for garnish", "4 pounds boneless beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "4 Spanish or very large yellow onions, thinly sliced", "6 sprigs fresh thyme", "4 sprigs fresh parsley, plus chopped parsley, for garnish", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "2 cups beef or chicken stock, preferably homemade", "1 cup beer, preferably Belgian-style or brown ale", "Flaky sea salt, for garnish", "Dijon-style mustard, preferably extra-hot, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine salt, pepper, bay leaves and paprika.
