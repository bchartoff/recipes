{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chiffon Cake", "description": "In 1927, a former insurance agent in Los Angeles was fiddling obsessively with ingredients in his home kitchen when he came up with a cake that was weightless yet rich \u2014 angel and devil at once \u2014 which we know today as chiffon. His secret: Instead of butter, he used vegetable oil in a batter thick with yolks, folded together with glossy peaks of whipped egg whites. The cake\u2019s kinship to clouds makes it an ideal dessert for Christopher Tan, who lives in Singapore, where the temperature and humidity are enemies of more traditional, butter-based cakes. Here, he uses mandarin oranges, packing in as much juice and zest as possible. The most difficult part is beating the egg whites properly. Tan has a baking secret of his own: He mixes a little potato starch (which absorbs more liquid than other starches) into the meringue, to guard against deflating.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/04/dining/04EAT-chiffon-cake/04EAT-chiffon-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H5M", "recipeYield": "One 10-inch cake (8 to 12 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "cake flour, egg whites, freezer friendly, make-ahead, orange juice, orange zest, plan-ahead, potato starch, vegetable oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 512}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/140 grams superfine (caster) sugar\u00a0", "1 tablespoon/10 grams potato starch\u00a0", "9 large egg whites (325 grams)\u00a0", "1 teaspoon cream of tartar\u00a0", "1 3/4 cups/215 grams cake flour\u00a0", "2 teaspoons double-acting baking powder\u00a0", "2/3 cup/120 grams superfine (caster) sugar\u00a0\u00a0", "7 large egg yolks\u00a0", "1/2 cup/110 grams sunflower oil (or other neutral-tasting oil)\u00a0", "Grated zest of 4 large mandarin oranges (about 2 tablespoons)", "3/4 cup/170 grams fresh mandarin orange juice (see Tip)", "1 tablespoon/10 grams fresh lime or lemon juice\u00a0", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange one oven rack in the lower third of the oven and heat oven to 325 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Have ready a 10-inch ungreased, unlined chiffon cake pan (a 2-piece tube pan)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the meringue: Mix sugar with potato starch.
