{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Chip Cookies With Honey-Roasted Almonds and Chile", "description": "This is not your average chocolate chip cookie. Like the classic, it\u2019s chewy and layered with milk chocolate chips, but it\u2019s also packed with salty-sweet honey-roasted almonds and coated in a glimmering exterior. Drawing inspiration from the snack aisle, its generous dusting of cinnamon- and gochugaru-spiced sugar and a finishing of flaky sea salt mimic the coating used on the honey-roasted almonds. These cookies freeze incredibly well and bake up in just 10 minutes. The recipe is easy; the only challenge will be restraining yourself from not devouring too many at once.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Laurie Ellen Pellicano"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/dining/lep-milk-chocolate-almond-cookies/merlin_178752249_52027be1-2d49-46ca-8ea8-bf5d9e59cb3f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "42 (2-inch) cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack", "keywords": "almond butter, almonds, chocolate chip cookie, gochugaru, milk chocolate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 182}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/30 grams whole-wheat flour", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1 2/3 cups/365 grams light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/3 cup/80 grams unsalted creamy almond butter", "1 large egg plus 1 large yolk", "1 tablespoon honey", "1 cup/170 grams milk chocolate chips (or roughly chopped milk chocolate bar, disc or f\u00e8ves)", "1 cup/140 grams honey-roasted almonds, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup/50 grams natural or organic cane sugar (or regular granulated sugar)", "1/4 teaspoon gochugaru (Korean red-chile flakes) or similar mild flaky chile, such as Aleppo or silk chile", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking soda and baking powder.
