(Though today, cow\u2019s milk is often used.) Like other low-fat cheeses, it is perfect for grilling. It sears and colors quickly when it hits the hot grill. The interior softens, but the cheese doesn\u2019t melt; it just warms up invitingly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/12/dining/12Martha/12Martha-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, halloumi, japanese eggplant, sumac, zucchini, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 203}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 423, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "943 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound halloumi", "2 sweet red peppers", "1 large zucchini", "1 Japanese eggplant", "1 bunch scallions, trimmed", "Salt and pepper", "About 1/4 cup olive oil", "2 teaspoons fresh thyme or crumbled dried mint", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon sumac (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a hot grill.
