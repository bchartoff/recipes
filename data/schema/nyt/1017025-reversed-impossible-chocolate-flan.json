{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Reversed Impossible Chocolate Flan", "description": "In this magical recipe by Ben Mims from his cookbook \"Sweet & Southern,\" vanilla cake and chocolate custard are layered into a Bundt pan before baking. In the oven, the two switch places, with the heavier custard sinking while the cake rises to the surface. Once unmolded, you end up with a tender band of cake on the bottom and creamy, wobbly flan on top. It\u2019s rich, soft, deeply fudgy and a hit at dinner parties.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/03/dining/03BOOK_FOOD3/03BOOK_FOOD3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "chocolate, condensed milk, evaporated milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 628}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 398, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "285 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon/2 grams baking powder", "3/4 cup/177 milliliters unsweetened coconut milk", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters distilled white vinegar or coconut vinegar", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters coconut extract (optional)", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "1 stick/113 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/150 grams sugar", "1 large egg", "1 14-ounce can/414 milliliters sweetened condensed milk", "1 12-ounce can/355 milliliters evaporated milk", "1/2 cup/37 grams Dutch-process cocoa powder", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "4 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the batter", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 375 degrees.
