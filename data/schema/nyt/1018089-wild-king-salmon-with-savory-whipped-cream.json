The first wild salmon in spring has brilliant red flesh, a mild sweet flavor and a velvetlike texture. Farmed salmon doesn\u2019t compare. In this recipe, the salmon is cut on the diagonal into thin slices that cook quickly. They are topped with softly whipped cream that's seasoned with mustard, cayenne and lemon zest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/04/dining/04KITCH1_WEB/04KITCH1_WEB-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, heavy cream, mustard, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 369}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 341, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "327 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds king salmon fillet, skin off and pin bones removed", "Salt and pepper", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "Pinch of cayenne", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "1 tablespoon snipped chives", "2 tablespoons butter", "Tarragon leaves, for garnish", "Watercress, for garnish", "Violets, nasturtiums or other edible flower petals for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice salmon diagonally into 6 four-ounce portions about 1/2  to 3/4 inch thick (or have your fishmonger slice it).
