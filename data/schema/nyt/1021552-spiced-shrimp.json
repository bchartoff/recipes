{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Shrimp", "description": "The basic recipe for these quickly broiled shrimp is elastic, easily halved or scaled up. And the spice choices can vary. Here I have opted for ras el hanout, a complex North African blend that delivers modest peppery heat along with pungent elements of cumin, fenugreek and coriander, as well as the warm astringency of allspice and cloves. Harissa, a North African hot sauce, seasons the dip. Serve it as an appetizer or pair it with a grain like rice or farro, or a buttery tumble of fluffy couscous for a more substantial meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/dining/05pairrex/merlin_178770954_cf554b7e-e1b3-4568-9bb3-94c21775102c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large shrimp, about 20, preferably Gulf, shelled and deveined", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 cup plain Greek-style yogurt", "1 tablespoon harissa paste, or to taste", "1 tablespoon finely minced cilantro leaves", "2 tablespoons ras el hanout (Moroccan spice blend)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1/2 lemon, seeds removed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place shrimp in a bowl and add the salt.
