The filling is a simple mixture of onions and cabbage, cooked in butter  (traditionally in much more than I use here), until soft and sweet but not browned, then seasoned with dill, salt and pepper, and enriched with chopped hard-boiled eggs. I sometimes add a little ricotta to the mix. Traditional pirozhki dough is a rich pastry made with butter and sour cream.
