{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Berry Coconut No-Bake Cheesecake", "description": "In the height of summer, turning on the oven should be considered off limits, but we still need dessert. For that, there's the no-bake cheesecake, which has all the richness of the baked version without any of the baking. Here, Biscoff cookies add a bit of spice, which pairs beautifully with toasted coconut, and we swap the heavy cream for rich, fluffy whipped coconut cream. The topping combines cooked and fresh berries for a wonderful variety of texture and flavor. Just about any varieties will work here, so use what looks best. A combination of blueberries and blackberries or raspberries is quite nice.\n\nBe sure to plan ahead with this recipe. The cans of coconut milk need to be chilled at least overnight, and as does the finished cheesecake before it can be sliced.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/20/dining/20COOKING-BERRY-CHEESECAKE1/20COOKING-BERRY-CHEESECAKE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "berries, coconut cream, cream cheese, graham cracker, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 356}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/60 grams shredded unsweetened coconut", "1 3/4 cups/236 grams finely crushed Biscoff cookie crumbs (or 1 3/4 cups/236 grams graham cracker crumbs and 1 tablespoon brown sugar), from about 30 Biscoff cookies or 15 whole graham crackers", "6 tablespoons/86 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "Pinch of kosher salt", "2 (14-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk, chilled in the refrigerator overnight (see note)", "16 ounces/452 grams cream cheese, softened but still cool", "2/3 cup/133 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "Pinch of kosher salt", "3 cups fresh blueberries, blackberries or raspberries", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "Toasted coconut chips, to taste, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, toast the coconut until deep golden brown while stirring constantly, 7 to 9 minutes.
