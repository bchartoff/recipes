Trade granulated or Demerara sugar for the sugar cube: The drink\u2019s flavor will remain the same, lacking only in the drama of the cube bubbling to its demise at the base of the glass. Finally, use Champagne if you\u2019re on a champagne budget, and dry sparkling wine if you\u2019re not.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/29/dining/23cocktailsrex1-classic/23cocktailsrex1-classic-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bitters, champagne, sugar cube, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 234}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 sugar cube (or 1 teaspoon granulated or Demerara sugar)", "4 to 6 dashes Angostura bitters\u00a0", "4 to 5 ounces Champagne or dry sparkling wine", "Long, thin lemon twist"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the sugar cube to a chilled champagne glass.
