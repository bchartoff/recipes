This recipe, courtesy of Kay Rentschler, creative director of Anson Mills, is a fail-safe method for making the mill\u2019s luxuriously flavored heirloom grits. When properly cooked \u2013 over very low heat after an overnight soak \u2013 the resulting grits are incredibly creamy and almost as sweet as fresh corn. It is important to understand why you must cook these grits over the lowest possible heat: these are coarse grits, and if they are over-hydrated or boiled after they begin to thicken they will take forever to cook. (In technical terms, thickening is the point at which the first starch takes hold, or the point after continuous gentle stirring when the grits particles remain suspended in the liquid and you no longer have to stir continuously). Moreover, as Anson Mills founder Glenn Roberts explained to me, if the heat is too high the new crop flavors of the corn will be blown out, in the same way that the flavor of fresh herbs is diminished by high heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/24/science/recipehealthbreakfastgrits/recipehealthbreakfastgrits-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 33}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 196, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "442 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup Anson Mills Colonial Coarse Pencil Cob Grits", "About 4 cups spring or filtered water", "Fine sea salt, to taste (1/2 to 1 teaspoon)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (or to taste)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The night before you wish to serve, place grits in a heavy, medium saucepan (Ms. Rentschler recommends a type called a Windsor saucepan; I used a Le Creuset).

Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the first starch takes hold (see above \u2013 it means that the mixture will begin to thicken and you will no longer have to stir constantly). Reduce heat to lowest possible setting. The grits should not be bubbling, they should be sighing, or breathing like somebody in a deep, comfortable sleep, rising up lazily in one big bubble, then falling as the bubble bursts. Watch carefully and each time they are thick enough to hold a spoon upright, stir in about 1/4 cup of the hot water. Stir in the salt after the first 10 minutes of gentle cooking. It should take about 25 minutes for the grits to be tender and creamy and by this time you should have added 3/4 to 1 cup water (perhaps a little more) in 3 or 4 additions."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When the grits are done \u2013 tender, creamy but not mushy, and able to hold their shape on a spoon \u2013 stir in the butter vigorously, add pepper, taste (carefully \u2013 don\u2019t burn your tongue after all that care) and adjust salt.
