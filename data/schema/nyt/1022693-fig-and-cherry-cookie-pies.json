{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fig and Cherry Cookie Pies", "description": "Similar to cucidati, the Italian fig cookies traditionally served at Christmastime, these adorable mini pies are filled with dried figs, dried cherries and almonds, then topped with a pretty almond-flavored glaze. But unlike most cucidati recipes, this one calls for softening the dried fruit in simmering water before it is pur\u00e9ed with nuts and spices. Sometimes dried fruit from the store comes without a drop of moisture left in it, so rehydrating it helps bring back some softness and ensures that the filling doesn\u2019t rob moisture from the pastry as it bakes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08COOKIESREX4-FIGPIES/merlin_198248580_c5c16139-694f-4d1d-b453-e2013970c559-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 2\u00bd dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "almonds, cherries, christmas cookie, figs, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 251}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/408 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "3/4 cup/92 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/256 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "3 large egg yolks", "5 tablespoons/75 grams heavy cream, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup/82 grams loosely packed chopped dried figs, hard stems removed (about 6 dried figs)", "1/2 cup/80 grams dried sweetened sour cherries or cranberries, chopped", "1/4 cup/38 grams raw or roasted almonds", "3 tablespoons/41 grams dark brown sugar", "2 tablespoons dark rum", "1 tablespoon freshly grated orange zest (from 1 orange)", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\u00a0(Diamond Crystal)", "1 cup/123 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "3 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream", "Sprinkles"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pastry: Combine the flour, confectioners\u2019 sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor.
