And the result is adult-appropriate, too. The combination is a streamlined mix of flavors and textures, since some of the ingredients added to ground meat for classic meatballs (bread crumbs, garlic, and Parmesan) are often used in the crispy coating on chicken nuggets. Cooking the panko and Parmesan-coated meatballs on the stovetop in a mixture of olive oil (for browning) and butter (for flavor) means no splatters \u2014 and meatballs that are tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.
