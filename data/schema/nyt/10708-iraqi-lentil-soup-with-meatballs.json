{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Iraqi Lentil Soup With Meatballs", "description": "This recipe came to The Times in a 2004 article about iftar, the breaking of the fast during Ramadan, the monthlong Muslim holiday during which observers abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset. Soup, like this hearty, spiced lentil soup with meatballs and angel hair pasta, is a common iftar meal as it provides substantial nutrition as well as plenty of hydration. It is adapted from a recipe belonging to Suad Shallal, who moved with her family from Iraq to the United States, in 1966. It was served at her son Andy's restaurant, Mimi's American Bistro in downtown Washington, each day during Ramadan. (The restaurant is now closed.) Mrs. Shallal's recipe calls for ground allspice, but feel free to experiment with other spices found in Middle Eastern cooking like cumin, coriander, cardamom and turmeric. And don't forget to taste and season with salt as you go.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/16/dining/16COOKING-IRAQIMEATBALLS1/16COOKING-IRAQIMEATBALLS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "pastas, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, brown lentils, ground meat, pasta, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 247}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 543, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1116 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium onions, minced", "1 pound ground beef or lamb or both", "1/2 cup finely chopped parsley", "1 cup soft bread crumbs", "1 teaspoon salt plus salt to taste", "1/4 teaspoon pepper", "1/2 teaspoon allspice, freshly ground from about 5 whole allspice", "2 tablespoons pure olive oil", "10 cups chicken broth", "1 pound brown or yellow lentils", "3 rounds angel hair pasta (about 2 ounces)", "2 carrots, diced fine", "Juice of one half lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees, and line a baking pan with parchment paper.
