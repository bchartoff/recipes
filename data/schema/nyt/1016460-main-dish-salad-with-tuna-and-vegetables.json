{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Main Dish Salad with Tuna and Vegetables", "description": "For the past couple of decades restaurant menus have named any salad that features tuna, whether fresh or canned, raw or cooked, a Ni\u00e7oise salad. Few of them resemble the traditional summer salad of Nice made with tomatoes and thin-skinned green peppers, cucumbers and other local vegetables such as fava beans and baby artichokes, olives, anchovies, hard-cooked eggs and oil-packed tuna. I often make a meal of a tuna, potato and vegetable salad. If tomatoes are out of season, I shred a carrot; and if green beans don\u2019t look good I use broccoli. Make sure to include lots of minced fresh herbs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/09/30/health/nutrition/30recipe.health.ready/30recipe.health.ready-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6 as a main dish", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 14}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 438, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "873 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons red or white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 small garlic clove, finely minced or pureed in a mortar and pestle", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil (can substitute some yogurt for some of the olive oil for a low-fat dressing)", "1 pound medium-size Yukon gold or red bliss potatoes, cut in 1/2 inch dice", "1 6 1/2-ounce can olive oil packed or water-packed light (not albacore) tuna, drained", "1 red or green pepper, cut in thin slices", "3 or 4 tomatoes, cut in wedges, or 1/2 pound carrots, shredded or cut in thin wide strips using a vegetable peeler", "1/2 pound green beans, trimmed and cut in half if long, or broccoli florets", "2 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and cut in wedges", "1 small head of Boston lettuce, romaine heart, or 4 to 5 cups mixed baby salad greens, washed and dried", "2 to 4 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, basil, tarragon, chives, marjoram"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl or pyrex measuring cup, whisk together the vinegar and lemon juice with the garlic, salt, pepper, and Dijon mustard.
