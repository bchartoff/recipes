{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Homemade Yogurt", "description": "Homemade yogurt is a snap to make. All you really need is good quality milk, a few spoonfuls of your favorite plain yogurt to use as a starter culture, and some time to let it sit. You can substitute low-fat milk here if you\u2019d rather; 2 percent works a lot better than 1 percent. Skim milk will give you a thinner yogurt, though if you add some dry milk powder to the milk as it heats (about 1/2 cup), that will help thicken it. Creamline (non-homogenized milk) will give you a cream top on your yogurt. Homogenized milk is smooth throughout.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/dining/18YOGURT1/18YOGURT1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 3/4 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, snack, project", "keywords": "cream, milk, whole milk yogurt, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 697}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 61, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "43 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 quarts whole milk, the fresher the better", "1/4 cup heavy cream (optional)", "3 to 4 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt with live and active cultures"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rub an ice cube over the inside bottom of a heavy pot to prevent scorching (or rinse the inside of the pot with cold water).
