{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Barbecued Chicken and Mushroom Tostadas", "description": "This recipe offers a novel way to create chips. When  corn tortillas are toasted in the oven, they get hard, not crispy. When they are toasted in the microwave, they get that crispy snap. This method requires a little patience: Zap a tortilla for a minute and it will be soggy, even wet, on the bottom. Flip it over and zap it again, and all the moisture will be gone. Sometimes it takes a few turns, as every microwave is different. Watch closely, though, as they tortillas burn quickly once dry.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/13/science/12recipehealth/12recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, nut-free, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 218, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1821 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole chicken breast on the bone, skinned and split, or 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1 1/3 to 1 1/2 pounds", "2 1/2 quarts water", "1 onion, quartered", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed", "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme or oregano, or a combination", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "8 white or cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced", "1/4 cup prepared barbecue sauce", "6 corn tortillas, halved and toasted in the microwave (see above)", "2 cups arugula", "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "6 radishes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the microwave-toasted tortilla chips", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the tortillas in half or into quarters, or leave whole.

Partly cover, reduce the heat to low and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through (cut one in half to check; the meat should not be pink). Add salt to taste. Allow the chicken to cool in the broth if there is time. Remove the chicken from the broth when it is cool enough to handle. Remove from the bone and shred by pulling strips of chicken off the top of the breast, with the grain. You should have about 4 cups of shredded chicken. Strain the chicken broth and refrigerate overnight (the next morning, skim off and discard the fat and freeze the broth in smaller containers)."}]}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy skillet and add the mushrooms.
