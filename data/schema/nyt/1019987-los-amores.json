But there\u2019s no need to limit the drink to one annual event. Serve it at Mother\u2019s Day; it\u2019s actually mild enough for brunch. It also suits an anniversary party, a summertime celebration and \u2014 prepared in a generous quantity to fill a punch bowl \u2014 one of December\u2019s festive occasions. It\u2019s easily made. The drink was inspired by the classic Kir Royale (Champagne and cassis) though a variation that suggests a margarita is another option: Replace the strawberries with a couple of blood orange segments and use a triple-sec liqueur instead of the cassis. Garnish it with a blood orange segment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/dining/06burner2/merlin_150161616_63ade586-1dd9-4ffc-9664-87bd595fba31-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "creme de cassis, sparkling wine, strawberries, tequila", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 12}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 246, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "19 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 red ripe strawberries", "3/4 ounce lime juice", "3/4 ounce simple syrup (see note)", "1/4 ounce cr\u00e8me de cassis", "1 ounce silver tequila", "3 to 4 ounces dry sparkling wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Muddle two of the strawberries in a cocktail shaker.
