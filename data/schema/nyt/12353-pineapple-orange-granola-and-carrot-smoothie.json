These are ingredients I like in a salad, and they work well together after taking a trip through the blender \u2014 especially with fresh ginger added to the mix.  With that, I broadened my horizons and explored fruit and vegetable smoothies. I\u2019d picked several pounds of oranges from a friend\u2019s tree, so I used fresh orange juice as the liquid, and for each drink I combined one or two fruits with a vegetable. I was thinking the smoothies would make great snacks, but in fact these make satisfying meals. They\u2019re packed with vitamins, especially C and A, beta carotene, and antioxidant-rich flavonoids. A small amount of granola contributes great texture to this tangy smoothie. I prefer the thick version without the ice cubes, but that\u2019s a matter of taste. Pineapple is an excellent source of manganese and contains an enzyme called bromelain that aids digestion.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/28/science/27recipehealth/27recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 generous serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, shakes and smoothies", "keywords": "carrot, orange, pineapple, dairy-free, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 24}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 211, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "37 milligrams", "sugarContent": "28 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice", "1 cup fresh pineapple (about 125 grams)", "2 tablespoons granola (preferably homemade)", "1 small or 1/2 large carrot, peeled and sliced or diced (about 50 grams)", "2 ice cubes (optional)", "Carrot sticks or curls for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in a blender and blend for 1 full minute."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12353-pineapple-orange-granola-and-carrot-smoothie"}
