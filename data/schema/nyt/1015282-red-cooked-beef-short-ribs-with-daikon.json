{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red-Cooked Beef Short Ribs With Daikon", "description": "This technique, called red cooking, involves simmering meat with soy sauce, sugar and sweet aromatics like star anise and cinnamon. It happens in a wok, but instead of a quick high-heat stir-fry, it is a slow braise, more like a savory stew. Once the stew is assembled and simmering, it\u2019s mostly a matter of waiting. Top off the liquid from time to time, but add only enough to barely cover the meat. The final step of cooking down the sauce intensifies the seasoning, accentuating the pungency of ginger and orange.
