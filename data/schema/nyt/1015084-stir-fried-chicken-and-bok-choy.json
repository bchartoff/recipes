{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Chicken and Bok Choy", "description": "No need for a wok here. You can use a flat-bottomed skillet or saut\u00e9 pan instead, the bigger the better. You want as much surface area as possible to get as hot as possible, so preheat the pan for at least five minutes before adding the oil. There should be a forbidding amount of smoke when the ingredients hit the pan (open the windows and turn on the fan before you start). That will give you the deepest sear. Stir-fries are infinitely variable, and you can change up this recipe by using beef or pork, and other green vegetables (asparagus, broccoli, mustard greens, cabbage, spinach or thinly sliced green beans) substitute nicely for the bok choy. Make a version of this dish once or twice and you\u2019ll have a reliable and delicious alternative to takeout.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/10/dining/10bokchoy/10bokchoy-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 2 to 3", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick", "keywords": "bok choy, chicken thigh, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 753}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 488, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "731 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar", "1 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil", "2 teaspoons light brown sugar", "3/4 pound boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch strips", "2 tablespoons finely chopped gingerroot", "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil", "1/2 pound bok choy (1 head), trimmed and thinly sliced", "2 leeks (1/2 pound), halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "Pinch chile flakes", "Salt, as needed", "Cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar.
