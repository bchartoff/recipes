The Campari jelly used here was part of the duo\u2019s first job in the United States, a dessert for a dinner in New York in 2009. This jelly was an outer layer, molded over a jelly  made with orange juice, and the result was something like a Campari and soda, but in jelly form.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "campari, sugar, unflavored gelatin, dairy-free, nut-free, dessert", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup sugar", "1/2 cup Campari, at room temperature", "1 packet unflavored gelatin", "3/4 cup sparkling water", "1 teaspoon silver mini drag\u00e9es, optional", "Orange jellies (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012476-orange-jelly\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make simple syrup: Place sugar in a saucepan, add 2/3 cup water, bring to a simmer and cook just until sugar dissolves.
