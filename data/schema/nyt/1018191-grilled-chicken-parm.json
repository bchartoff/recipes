There is sweetness and salt to the dish, along with the base creaminess of cheese and the satisfying crunch of the chicken\u2019s crust. These combine, especially under a spray of red pepper flakes, to deliver immense satisfaction. This recipe, adapted from one the chef Justin Bazdarich uses at the Speedy Romeo restaurants in New York, moves the preparation of the dish to the grill, and delivers a dish that is smoke-scented and beautiful, with flavors that manage to be both delicate and robust.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/26/magazine/26eat/26mag-26eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chicken thighs, kale, mozzarella, tomatoes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 309}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 782, "unsaturatedFatContent": "39 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "62 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "46 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1006 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 boneless, skin-on chicken thighs, about 2 1/2 pounds", "1 tablespoon lemon zest", "6 sprigs thyme, leaves only", "3 cloves garlic, peeled", "1/2 cup olive oil", "1 28-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1 medium-size bunch kale, stems removed and sliced into strips", "Red-pepper flakes, to taste", "8-10 basil leaves, roughly torn", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella sliced thinly into 8 pieces", "1/3 cup grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate the chicken.
