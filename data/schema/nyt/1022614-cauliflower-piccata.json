{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cauliflower Piccata", "description": "Piccata sauce \u2014 that buttery, briny combination of lemon, butter and capers, silky in texture and tart in flavor \u2014 is not just for chicken or swordfish. It\u2019s also a zesty anchor for roasted vegetables. Here, cauliflower is roasted at high heat, which concentrates the flavor, adds nuttiness and encourages caramelization, before being doused with the sauce. Chickpeas make this a fuller vegetarian meal, but leave them out if you\u2019d rather. Piccata dishes are often served with long pasta, which tangle with the tangy sauce, but this one is also great alongside rice or tender-crisp vegetables like blistered green beans. While you are at it, try this sauce with sweet butternut squash, charred broccoli, earthy roasted carrots, golden wedges of cabbage or crispy slices of tofu.\n\nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2001/10/07/dining/hm-cauliflower-piccata/merlin_195006624_9fe19ba9-b756-415a-9fe7-f65fc4ade92f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "capers, cauliflower, chickpea, lemon, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3191}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cauliflower, cut into large 2-inch florets", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained (optional)", "1 shallot, finely diced", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 cup vegetable stock", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons capers, drained", "Zest of 1 lemon", "2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)", "Parsley, chopped, for garnish", "1 lemon, sliced, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
