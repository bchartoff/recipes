Follow Mr. Schlesinger\u2019s lead and leave the steaks untouched on the grill before you flip them. They should be beautifully seared, chestnut brown around the edges where the fat has roasted down, with a tight crust from the rub. Later, perhaps, you can reward yourself with a beer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beef, steak, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 46}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 cup loosely packed cilantro, including stems", "3 tablespoons chipotles en adobo, or to taste", "2 tablespoons ground cumin", "1 tablespoon mustard powder", "2 tablespoons ground coriander", "2 tablespoons salt", "2 tablespoons ground black pepper", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 limes)", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 rib-eye steaks, each 2 inches thick and about 1 pound", "4 tablespoons butter, softened", "2 tablespoons minced cilantro leaves", "1 clove garlic, minced", "2 tablespoons lime juice (from 1 lime)", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a fire in your grill; if using a gas grill, turn both burners to high."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put all spice paste ingredients in a food processor and pur\u00e9e.
