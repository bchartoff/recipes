{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Pizza", "description": "This is a vegan spin on classic pizza margherita, adorned simply with tomato sauce and rounds of cashew \u201cmozzarella\u201d cheese. Right after you make the cheese, it will be smooth and spreadable \u2014 more like ricotta than mozzarella \u2014 but as it bakes, it will firm up, resulting in pockets of creaminess that hold their shape in a sea of tomato sauce. If you\u2019re short on time, there are a couple ways to make the pizza come together more quickly: Use store-bought crust or dough (enough for 1 large or 2 smaller pizzas), or try one of the many shredded vegan mozzarella cheeses available in stores these days. You can use a heaping cup on each pizza.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gena Hamshaw"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/20/dining/gh-vegan-pizza/merlin_171739674_697084cc-d19a-4d07-8983-5804a56204f2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pizza and calzones, main course", "keywords": "cashew, flour, lemon juice, olive oil, sugar, tomato sauce, yeast, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 125}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose or 00 flour, plus more for dusting", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon instant yeast", "3/4 cup lukewarm water (see Tip)", "Olive oil, for greasing the bowl", "1 heaping cup (about 5 ounces) raw cashews, soaked in water for at least 2 hours then drained", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "Black pepper, to taste", "13 to 15 ounces pizza sauce or tomato sauce", "Fresh basil leaves (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pizza crust, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar and yeast in a mixing bowl.
