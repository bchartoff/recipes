This version, adapted from the chef JJ Johnson, uses celebratory seafood, such as scallops, crab, lobster and shrimp, and includes okra rounds in a nod to his family\u2019s southern roots. Mr. Johnson also pulled inspiration from Gullah Geechee cuisine, Native American and West African flavors and Louisiana's culinary traditions for the ultimate melting pot of gumbo. Be sure to make the gumbo spice mix, which adds heat and depth to this luxurious and comforting stew.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kayla Stewart"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/29/dining/27NEW-YEARSREX3/27NEW-YEARSREX3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "crab meat, jasmine rice, lobster, okra, sea scallop, shrimp, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 498}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon dried oregano", "1 tablespoon dried thyme", "1 teaspoon powdered bay leaf (see Tip 1)", "1 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder", "1 tablespoon onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne, or more to taste", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons smoked paprika", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "4 tablespoons salted butter", "1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1 small onion, finely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 small celery stalk, finely chopped", "1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped", "1/2 cup grape tomatoes, halved", "1/2 cup dried shrimp (optional; see Tip 2)", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "5 cups store-bought or homemade chicken stock", "4 ounces fresh or thawed frozen okra, sliced into rounds (1 cup)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "2 lobster tails, shelled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces (optional; see Tip 3)", "1/4 pound picked crab meat", "1/4 pound sea scallops", "1/2 pound medium shrimp", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 cups cooked jasmine rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the spice mix: Place all ingredients in a bowl and stir until combined.
