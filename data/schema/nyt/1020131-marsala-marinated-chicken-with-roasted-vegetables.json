{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Marsala-Marinated Chicken With Roasted Vegetables", "description": "Marsala and chicken don\u2019t always have to perform the same scaloppine routine, where you saut\u00e9 the pounded breast and deglaze it with the wine to make a sauce, perhaps adding some mushrooms and cream. You\u2019ll get so much more flavor if you use chicken thighs and let them marinate in the fortified wine with some Dijon and shallots before cooking. Transfer the poultry with mushrooms, carrots and more shallots to a sheet pan, roast them and dinner is done. This Marsala marinade is generous and versatile: It\u2019s veal, pork and lamb-friendly. Set some aside before it touches the meat and you can even turn it into a salad-friendly vinaigrette.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Charlotte Druckman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/23/dining/23marsalarex1/merlin_153567093_192490e2-6964-48d7-916a-45da90cacffc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, roasts, vegetables", "keywords": "chicken thighs, dijon mustard, marsala, mushroom, oregano, shallot, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 482}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 615, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1096 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large shallots", "3 tablespoons Dijon mustard, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon honey", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 cups dry Marsala", "1/4 cup plus 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, and more to taste", "6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)", "2 fresh oregano sprigs plus 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves", "4 large carrots (about 3/4 pound)", "3/4 pound mixed mushrooms, such as cremini and shiitake (or fancier chanterelle, maitake, or morel mushrooms)", "3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "10 ounces salad greens"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the marinade: Finely chop 2 shallots.
