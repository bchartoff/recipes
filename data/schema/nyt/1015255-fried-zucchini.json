{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Zucchini", "description": "Fried food is probably not on anyone\u2019s lists of healthy eats, but you have to start with this: Fat is good for you.\n\nThere are differences among fats, of course, but with trans-fats in full retreat and lard and butter making comebacks, the whole fat-eating thing is starting to make some sense. Of course, the key word is moderation. You can eat fat as long as it\u2019s high quality and you don\u2019t eat it to the exclusion of plants.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason you shouldn\u2019t reject deep-frying at home; I do it about once a month. The second reason is that you know you love it. The third is that it can be fast and easy. The fourth is that you can deep-fry plants.
