Airy, creamy and delightfully reminiscent of childhood packaged snacks (thanks to instant vanilla pudding mix), this dessert is both a crowd pleaser and easy to assemble. If you\u2019re making 12 individual servings rather than one large one, you\u2019ll have enough cookies to use two per layer. If you prefer more coverage, make only two layers and use three cookies per layer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/18/multimedia/13PUDDING-REX2-banana-pudding-jlmg/18PUDDING-REX2-banana-pudding-jlmg-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H30M", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "banana, heavy cream, plan-ahead, sweetened condensed milk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1814}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "1 1/2 cups ice-cold water", "1 (3.4-ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix", "3 cups cold heavy cream", "1 (11-ounce) box vanilla wafer cookies (such as Nilla)", "4 to 5 ripe bananas, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the condensed milk and water on low speed until blended, then increase the speed to medium and whisk until well combined, about 1 minute.
