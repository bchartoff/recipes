At this time of year, what really is the option? Besides, I love these breakfast sundaes best when the berries are still frozen and tasting like a tart sorbet against the smooth creaminess of the yogurt and the sweet crunch of the cookie crumbs.\n\nI often find it easier to make these, too, the night before. The raspberries thaw and the yogurt stiffens somewhat, and yes, the cookie crumbs in the middle lose their crunch, but everything melds together gloriously. A last-minute sprinkling of cookie crumbs on top is all they need.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/27/dining/swirls/swirls-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, quick", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, greek yogurt, raspberries, main course, raw", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 175, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "138 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups (one 12-ounce bag) frozen raspberries", "4 teaspoons confectioners' sugar", "2 cups Greek or whole milk yogurt", "1/2 cup oatmeal cookie crumbs (from crumbled cookies)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set aside six glasses, each with 3/4-cup capacity.
