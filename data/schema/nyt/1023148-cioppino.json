{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cioppino", "description": "The cioppino at Anchor Oyster Bar in San Francisco is a showstopper \u2014 a beautiful, long-simmered tomato sauce thinned with clam juice and packed with a mix of excellent seafood. Work with whatever seafood is best where you are, though Dungeness crab in the shell is nonnegotiable for the Anchor\u2019s owner and chef, Roseann Grimm, the granddaughter of an Italian crab fisherman. Replicating her dish at home involves a lot of work, but the results are beyond delicious. To get ahead, you can make the marinara base and roasted garlic butter up to a couple days before. A half hour or so before you\u2019re ready to sit down and eat, bake the garlic bread and cook the seafood. Don\u2019t forget crab crackers \u2014 you\u2019ll need them at the table to get to the crab meat \u2014 and plenty of napkins!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/04/dining/03cioppinorex/merlin_205954344_dbaede77-c751-4ae4-886c-e3007feaf113-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "baguette, bloody mary mix, dungeness crab, garlic, littleneck clam, mussels, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 605}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup whole star anise", "1 small yellow onion, diced", "1 large garlic head, cloves separated and peeled", "1/2 small red bell pepper, coarsely chopped", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1/2 cup Bloody Mary mix", "1 (29-ounce) can diced tomatoes", "1 (29-ounce) can tomato sauce", "3 tablespoons dried oregano", "1 tablespoon dried basil", "1 tablespoon dried thyme", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 dried bay leaf", "4 whole garlic heads (about 11 ounces)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 cup/8 ounces salted butter, softened", "1 baguette or ciabatta loaf, split horizontally", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "Dried oregano, for sprinkling", "3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan", "2 cups clam juice", "6 fresh thyme sprigs", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds Dungeness crab clusters (5 legs and 2 claws with bodies attached)", "12 littleneck clams (about 1 pound), <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/dining/100000003070339/cooking-techniques-cleaning-mussels.html\">cleaned</a>", "12 mussels (about 1/2 pound), cleaned", "2 cod fillets (about 4 ounces each)", "4 large peeled, tail-on shrimp (about 1/3 pound)", "Finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toast the star anise by stirring frequently in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
