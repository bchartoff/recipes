{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Salmon and Eggplant With XO Sauce", "description": "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020182-xo-sauce\">XO sauce</a>, a prized seafood condiment from Hong Kong, involves frying pricey dried shrimp and scallops with Chinese cured ham and aromatics until jammy and full of umami. This pantry-friendly version uses smoked mussels to replicate the seafood flavor without breaking the bank. The rich, sweet-salty sauce balances fatty salmon and silky eggplant, but the savory condiment has endless uses: Dollop it on scrambled eggs, fried rice, roasted veggies or noodles. Extra sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for one month.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2001/09/01/dining/kc-salmon-eggplant/merlin_193478505_bc7a7721-7021-4258-a079-fdf5a30657ae-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood, main course", "keywords": "eggplant, mussels, salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 195}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (4-ounce) can smoked mussels", "1 1/2 pounds Japanese eggplant (5 to 6 medium), trimmed, halved lengthwise and then crosswise", "3/4 cup safflower or canola oil", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 shallot, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced peeled ginger", "1 ounce sliced prosciutto (about 2 slices), finely chopped", "1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine or dry sherry", "2 tablespoons turbinado sugar", "1 green Thai chile, seeded and minced", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1 tablespoon oyster sauce", "1 teaspoon fish sauce", "4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets", "Thinly sliced scallions, for garnish", "Steamed rice, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain the mussels and reserve the liquid.
