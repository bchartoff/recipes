{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Baby Cakes", "description": "Created as a first birthday treat for a little girl, these are a sweet example of something that is simple but memorable. The look is adorable: a cake sized for a baby\u2019s hand, covered in a soft white-chocolate glaze and finished with sprinkles. The taste is primarily vanilla \u2014 that\u2019s the extract and white chocolate at play \u2014 and there\u2019s a sly hint of rose, added as much for mystery as for bolstering the best qualities of the fresh strawberry that\u2019s tucked into the cake\u2019s middle. But it\u2019s the cake\u2019s texture that\u2019s most confoundingly wonderful. It\u2019s tender and chewy, with a compact crumb still light enough to bring you back for another serving. When it\u2019s not a baby\u2019s birthday, skip the candles and have the cakes with espresso \u2014 or even Champagne.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/08/magazine/08mag-eat/08mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "24 mini cakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "birthday, cupcake, strawberries, white chocolate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 971}, "recipeIngredient": ["Baker\u2019s spray (optional)", "3 to 6 hulled strawberries, depending on size\u00a0", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon rose extract (optional)", "1 tablespoon light corn syrup\u00a0", "2/3 cup/86 grams all-purpose flour", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted, still warm", "3 ounces/85 grams white-chocolate bar, melted and fluid", "1 tablespoon milk", "3 ounces/85 grams white chocolate, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon neutral oil", "Sprinkles"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cakes: Center a rack in the oven and heat oven to 400 degrees.
