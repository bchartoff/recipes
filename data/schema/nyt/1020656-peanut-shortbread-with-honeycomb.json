{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peanut Shortbread With Honeycomb", "description": "A giant crumbly peanut cookie topped with airy honeycomb and lashed with dark chocolate, this recipe is especially good if you love salty-sweet flavors, and fun to eat too, since you break off shards to serve. Honeycomb candy is one of the easiest confections to make, but, like any candy, it requires careful attention to timing and safety. It\u2019s helpful to have a clip-on candy thermometer to tell you when the sugar is at the right temperature, and you\u2019ll want to transfer the hot sugar mixture to a large bowl. Doing so not only ensures that there is plenty of room for the dramatic billowing that occurs when the baking soda is added, but it also slows the cooking, to avoid burning.  This recipe yields quite a lot of pieces, making its perfect for packing into tins for gifts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/ss-peanut-shortbread/merlin_163732203_8ebf5eb4-4341-4586-9248-f59d3f9a58c6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13-inch pan (about 3 to 4 dozen pieces)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "butter, chocolate, dark chocolate, honey, peanut, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 389}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), softened, plus more for greasing the pan", "1/2 cup/110 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla paste or extract, or scrapings from 1/2 vanilla bean", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "1 cup/140 grams whole salted, roasted peanuts, finely ground, plus about 1/2 cup/70 grams roughly chopped salted, roasted peanuts", "1 tablespoon baking soda", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters honey", "4 ounces/115 grams dark chocolate, chopped (about 2/3 cup)", "1/2 teaspoon vegetable shortening", "Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
