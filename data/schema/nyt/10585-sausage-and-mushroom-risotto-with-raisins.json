{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sausage and Mushroom Risotto With Raisins", "description": "This risotto is a variation on a dish the chef and restaurateur Jimmy Bradley\u2019s grandmother made when he was a kid, shuttling between parents in Rhode Island and Philadelphia. Mr. Bradley hauled it out one day when he had mushrooms to spare; it started as a special and was until recently served on the menu at the Red Cat, beneath a sweet-and-sour glazed quail. You don\u2019t need the quail. As is true in so much of Bradley's cooking, there is a genuine interplay of flavors and textures at work in the dish. Above the foundation of broth-enriched rice, the sweet of the raisins rides calmly into the bite of the radicchio. Meanwhile, the soft, salty whoosh of the cheese rises up over the loamy richness of the mushrooms like steam over a marsh. The sausage seems an elegant afterthought, fennel-studded excess to help blunt autumn\u2019s chill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "arborio rice, italian sausage, raisins, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 29}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 474, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "719 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup golden raisins", "6 ounces sweet or hot Italian sausage (about 1 1/2 links), casings removed", "2 small cloves garlic, finely minced", "3 ounces (1 cup) cremini mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and quartered", "4 1/2 cups lightly salted chicken broth", "2 tablespoons butter", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "3 tablespoons finely minced onion", "2 tablespoons finely minced celery", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt or to taste", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste", "1 1/2 cups Arborio rice", "1/2 cup white wine", "1 small head radicchio (8 ounces), shredded (4 cups)", "1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves (no stems), finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place raisins in a bowl; cover with hot water.
