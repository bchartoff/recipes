{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Potato Gratin With Smoked and Fresh Salmon", "description": "Swedish laxpudding, the basis for this brunch-friendly bake, is a dish that lives in the same neighborhood\u00a0as frittata, potato gratin and quiche. The original is much more restrained than this version, comprised only of potatoes, smoked salmon and dill, held together with an egg custard. My additions include saffron and capers, which I borrowed from Sicily and work surprisingly well here. This can be served for any meal but is an especially impressive brunch dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/21/dining/21ottorex1/merlin_133672959_e9dfb6cf-384d-4d32-9e46-fc254769fe10-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, casseroles", "keywords": "anchovies, capers in salt, eggs, potato, salmon, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 187}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 463, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "848 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Generous pinch of saffron", "3 large potatoes or 2 celeriac bulbs (about 2.5 pounds/1.2 kilograms total), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch-/1-centimeter-thick half-moons", "1/3 cup/75 milliliters olive oil, more as needed", "Salt and black pepper", "3 oil-packed anchovies, thinly sliced\u00a0", "2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "About 1 pound/500 grams large leaf spinach, washed, stems and leaves roughly chopped", "1 gently packed cup (about 1 ounce/30 grams) basil leaves, roughly chopped", "1/2 cup/20 grams roughly chopped fresh dill (about 3/4 ounce), more for garnish", "4 tablespoons/50 grams brined baby capers (about 1.75 ounces), drained and patted dry", "About 1 pound/460 grams skinless salmon fillets, cut into 1-inch/2- to 3-centimeter pieces", "About 5 ounces/150 grams thinly sliced cold-smoked salmon, cut into 1-inch/2- to 3-centimeter pieces", "5 egg yolks", "1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch", "1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest", "1 2/3 cups/400 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/100 milliliters heavy cream (double cream)", "1 lemon, cut into wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit/240 degrees Celsius.
