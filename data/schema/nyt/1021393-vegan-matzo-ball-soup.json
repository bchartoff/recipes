{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Matzo Ball Soup", "description": "The actress Natalie Portman was seeking a good vegan matzo ball soup, and the result is this recipe: soft matzo balls that hold together thanks to a little help from chickpeas. Matzo meal, potato starch, a little olive oil and lots of ginger, dill and cilantro lend plenty of flavor, while chickpea water (known as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/dining/aquafaba-vegan-egg-substitute.html\">aquafaba</a>) provides binding that would otherwise come from eggs. You can use the liquid from canned chickpeas, but the liquid from dry chickpeas soaked, then cooked in water works best. Ginger and nutmeg are characteristics of German-Jewish matzo balls, while the Yemenite addition of cilantro and dill adds even more brightness and flavor. Natalie is right: \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad world without good matzo balls.\u201d\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/dining/jn-vegan-matzo-ball-soup/merlin_176535159_336c9782-d082-4432-b5b2-8acc6321546d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings (about 20 matzo balls)", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "carrot, celery, chickpea, herbs, kohlrabi, leek, matzo meal, potato starch, vegetable broth, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 448}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup matzo meal", "1/4 cup potato starch", "2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley", "2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro", "2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger, or to taste", "1 teaspoon minced fresh dill", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup olive oil", "3/4 to 1 cup chickpea cooking liquid (from home-cooked chickpeas or about two 15-ounce cans, preferably low-sodium)", "8 cups vegetable broth", "2 medium carrots, peeled and diced", "2 stalks celery, diced", "1/2 kohlrabi, peeled and diced", "1 leek, white and light green parts only, cleaned and diced", "1 yellow or white onion, peeled and diced", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "3 garlic cloves, chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Lots of chopped fresh herbs (such as dill, cilantro, parsley or basil), for serving", "Zhug or harissa, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the matzo balls: In a medium bowl, mix the matzo meal, potato starch, parsley, cilantro, ginger, dill, nutmeg, baking soda and baking powder with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
