In fact he loves them. He just thinks a little meat makes them better.\n\nEven his fish gets the meat treatment. When you look at Mr. Chang's razor clams with kielbasa, you see a dish that, with a couple of exceptions, like the addition of soy and ginger, could have originated in Portugal. Of course that country's cuisine has as much respect for the tradition of including meat in nearly everything as Mr. Chang's own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/30/dining/with-Kielbasa/with-Kielbasa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, one pot", "keywords": "clams, kielbasa, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 10}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 215, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1613 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn", "1 large onion, sliced", "Salt and pepper", "24 razor clams, cleaned, or littleneck or Manila clams, scrubbed", "1/4 pound kielbasa or other garlicky sausage, sliced", "1/2 cup sake or not-too-dry white wine", "2 tablespoons finely chopped scallions", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "Chopped fresh jalape\u00f1os or other fresh chilies for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put half the oil in large skillet over medium-high heat; add onions, salt and pepper and cook for a minute, stirring occasionally, until they soften and start to brown."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add clams and raise heat to high; stir for another minute.
