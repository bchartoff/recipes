{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quinoa Salad With Swiss Chard and Goat Cheese", "description": "This versatile salad, or pilaf, may be construed as a home cook\u2019s answer to a fast-casual lunch bowl. But it does not need to be piled high with a freewheeling array of additional ingredients. As it is, this could be a stand-alone first course, a lunch dish or a side to serve alongside meat or seafood. Serve it hot, warm or at room temperature. The quinoa adapts well to advance preparation, and letting the salad sit before serving improves the texture. In summer, this dish is prime picnic material.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/12/dining/12PAIRING1/12PAIRING1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "cremini, quinoa, swiss chard, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 355}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 414, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "998 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch red Swiss chard, about 1 pound", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium red onion, chopped", "3 large cloves garlic, slivered", "1 cup quinoa", "1 teaspoon dry mustard", "2 cups vegetable broth", "Salt and ground black pepper", "12 ounces small cremini mushrooms, stems trimmed, halved", "4 ounces plain goat cheese, chilled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove stems from Swiss chard and chop in 1/2-inch pieces.
