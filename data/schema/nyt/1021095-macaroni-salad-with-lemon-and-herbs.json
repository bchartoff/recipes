But this version also happens to be bright, acidic and herbaceous. The traditional elements have been preserved \u2014 elbow macaroni, mayonnaise and a pinch of sugar are mandatory \u2014 but they\u2019ve been bolstered by bright flavors: lemon zest, tangy capers and pickles, crunchy celery and tons of fresh herbs. It goes lighter on mayonnaise than the original, swapping in tangy buttermilk for a dressing that is more glossy than gloopy. It can be served straight from the fridge or at room temperature. A splash of water stirred in restores its silky sheen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/dining/18saladrex/merlin_171784302_ce73e819-9689-4984-bd53-a98df41b2b88-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "10 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "capers, celery, macaroni, mayonnaise, pasta salad, pickles, picnic, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3594}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "2/3 cup minced bread-and-butter pickles", "2 large stalks celery, peeled and finely chopped", "4 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced, plus more for garnish", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "1/2 cup buttermilk (see Tip)", "1/3 cup finely chopped fresh Italian parsley, plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup chopped fresh dill, plus small sprigs for garnish", "1/4 cup drained jarred capers, chopped, plus 3 tablespoons caper brine", "4 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest and 4 teaspoons juice (from 1 large lemon)", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "16 ounces elbow macaroni"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "While the water comes to a boil, prepare your dressing: In a large bowl, stir together pickles, celery, scallions, mayonnaise, buttermilk, parsley, dill, capers and brine, mustard, lemon zest and juice, and sugar.
