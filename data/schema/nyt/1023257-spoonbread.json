{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spoonbread\u00a0", "description": "Popular in Virginia, the Carolinas and elsewhere in North America, spoonbread has a long history thought to date back to the Sewee tribe of the South Carolina Lowcountry. Somewhat closer to souffl\u00e9 than cornbread, its tender texture comes from eggs and the creamed corn. It\u2019s slightly sweet from the kernels, a bit of sugar and vanilla extract, but gently tangy from sour cream, relying upon simple ingredients that come together into something great. This version uses fresh or frozen crawfish, but don\u2019t worry if crawfish isn\u2019t available to you: Spoonbread is still wonderful without it.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/08/dining/mp-spoonbread/merlin_208251015_6cc9fb53-df95-4f8a-a651-5a19e139e008-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, seafood, main course, side dish", "keywords": "corn, creamed corn, stone-ground cornmeal", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 240}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing the pan and serving", "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup stone-ground cornmeal", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper\u00a0", "1 (15-ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained (or use 1 1/2 cups fresh corn kernels from 2 large ears of corn)", "1 (14.75-ounce) can creamed corn", "1 1/2 cups sour cream", "2 large eggs, beaten", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract\u00a0", "1 pound shelled frozen crawfish, defrosted and patted dry, or 1 pound shelled fresh crawfish (or skip crawfish altogether)", "A handful of chopped chives (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
