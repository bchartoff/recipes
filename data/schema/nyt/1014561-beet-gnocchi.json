Add minced garlic, 3 to 4 cups of chopped tomatoes, canned or fresh, and salt and pepper. Cook at a steady bubble until &lsquo;&lsquo;saucy.&rsquo;&rsquo; If the sauce becomes too thick, add a splash of the gnocchi cooking water before serving. Garnish with torn basil and/or grated Parmesan.<br/><br/>\n\n<strong>Brown Butter, Sage, and Parmesan</strong>: Put 4 tablespoons butter and a handful of fresh sage leaves (40 wouldn&rsquo;t be too many) in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until the butter is light brown and the sage is sizzling, about 3 minutes. Toss with the gnocchi, some of their cooking water and loads of grated Parmesan.<br/><br/>\n\n<strong>Olive Oil and Garlic</strong>: Put at least a tablespoon of minced garlic in a puddle of olive oil, along with (optional) red-pepper flakes and/or chopped anchovies. Cook until the garlic just turns golden (but no more than that). Toss with the gnocchi, some of their cooking water and plenty of chopped parsley.<br/><br/>\n\n<strong>Bacon and Cream</strong>: Cook some chopped bacon, prosciutto or pancetta in a bit of olive oil over medium-low heat until nearly crisp. Stir in 1/2 cup heavy cream and a lot of pepper. Let the cream thicken slightly before adding the gnocchi."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014561-beet-gnocchi"}
