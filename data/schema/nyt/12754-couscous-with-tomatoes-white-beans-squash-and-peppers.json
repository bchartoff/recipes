Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the couscous and add the cup of broth you removed from the stew. Stir well, or moisten your fingers and rub the couscous with them to evenly distribute the oil and broth. Add enough water to cover by 1/2 inch and let sit for 20 minutes, or until all of the liquid is absorbed. Stir every 5 minutes with a wooden spoon or rub the couscous between your moistened thumbs and fingers, so that the couscous doesn't lump. The couscous will now be fairly soft; fluff it with a fork or with your hands. The traditional way to finish reconstituting the couscous is to place it above the simmering stew for 45 minutes. I find, however, that steaming it in a microwave results in perfectly fluffy couscous. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic and pierce the plastic with the tip of a paring knife. Heat at 100 percent power for 3 minutes. Remove from the microwave carefully and allow it to sit for 1 minute. Carefully remove the plastic and fluff with forks or a spoon. Cover again with plastic and microwave for 2 to 3 more minutes. Be very careful when you remove the plastic, as the couscous will be steamy. You can reconstitute the couscous a day ahead and reheat in the microwave shortly before serving."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Reheat the stew and the couscous.
