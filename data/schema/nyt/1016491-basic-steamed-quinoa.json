{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basic Steamed Quinoa", "description": "Many recipes for quinoa instruct you to cook it like rice, in 2 parts water for 1 part grain. This works, but I find the grains are fluffier if I cook them in 3 parts water and drain the excess water once the quinoa is tender. The tiny seeds swell to about 4 times their original size, so 1 cup uncooked quinoa yields about 4 cups, enough for 6 to 8 servings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/11/03/health/nutrition/03recipehealth.ready/03recipehealth.ready-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "about 4 cups, serving 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 145}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 78, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "150 milligrams", "sugarContent": null, "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup quinoa", "3 cups water, chicken stock or vegetable stock", "1/2 teaspoon salt (more to taste)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the quinoa in a bowl and cover with cold water.
