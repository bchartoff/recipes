{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Marinated Grilled Vegetables", "description": "You\u2019ll always want a batch of these around: From the vegetables you grill to the seasonings you use, this recipe is endlessly adaptable. It also keeps for a few days and has so many applications. After the vegetables come off the grill, they soak in a piquant bath of coarse mustard, shallot and vinegar, though you could adjust flavorings as you wish: Add fresh or dried chile; thyme or rosemary; anchovy or capers; or a protein like feta, cubed salami, tofu or chickpeas. Then, use these deeply flavored vegetables on sandwiches, grilled bread, salads, frittatas, alongside grilled meat or fish, and so on.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/28/dining/28grilledrex-WEB/merlin_189645489_3f0106ba-f467-43eb-9367-2a787532a061-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "shallot", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 386}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing", "1/4 cup red wine vinegar or sherry vinegar", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons whole-grain mustard", "1 large shallot, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 pounds grilling vegetables, such as peppers (bell, shishito, mini), broccoli rabe, broccolini, asparagus, radicchio, fennel, corn, zucchini, eggplant, green beans or snap peas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a charcoal grill for two-zone cooking over medium-high heat by pouring the coals onto one half of the grill.
