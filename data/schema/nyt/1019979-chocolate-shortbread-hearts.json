{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Shortbread Hearts", "description": "Fragile and supremely buttery, these cocoa-flavored shortbread cookies are dunked partway in melted chocolate and sprinkled with an optional topping of crushed freeze-dried raspberries. If you use them, the berries add verve both from their scarlet color and their bright acidity, which is nice against the richness of the chocolate. But other garnishes \u2014 flaky sea salt, chopped pistachios, crushed candy canes, toasted coconut \u2014 can be substituted. Be sure not to roll the dough thinner than 1/2 inch. Otherwise, the cookies are apt to break and crumble after baking. Their thickness helps keep them intact.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/13/dining/13appetite-A1-ref/merlin_150162306_358a4c5a-3952-422a-9fda-b717ddd3ec05-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 18 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "cocoa powder, dark chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 232}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "27 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/40 grams unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/225 grams salted European-style (or cultured) butter (2 sticks), softened", "2/3 cup/135 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg yolk", "6 ounces dark, milk or white chocolate chips, or use some of each (about 1 cup)", "1/3 cup freeze-dried raspberries, lightly crushed (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat together butter and sugar until smooth.
