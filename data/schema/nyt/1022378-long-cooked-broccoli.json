A whole hour of simmering with the lid on? Yes! The result is an incredibly sweet, tender, juicy and delicious vegetable with almost no hands-on work. Finish the dish with plenty of cheese and lemon zest, and an extra drizzle of olive oil, and eat it just the way it is, or break it up into some hot, just-cooked pasta for a bigger meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/04/magazine/04mag-eat/04mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "broccoli", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1078}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds large-headed broccoli", "8 garlic cloves", "1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for serving", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Salt and pepper", "3 salt-packed anchovies or chopped oil-packed anchovies (optional)", "1 lemon, halved", "Pecorino Romano, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pick off the coarse leaves from the broccoli stems, and peel away any tough skin with a vegetable peeler.
