{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Crab Cakes", "description": "This recipe came to us by way of Garrett Oliver, the brewmaster of Brooklyn Brewery. He believes beer and wine should always be served with food. And beer, he contends, is often the better choice.\n\nWith these crab cakes, Mr. Oliver, an excellent cook who is widely-known for his successful beer-and-wine pairings, recommends an India pale ale. The bitterness of the hops plays nicely with the spiciness of the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/14/dining/Spicy-Crab-Cakes/Spicy-Crab-Cakes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 large or 4 small servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bread crumbs, jalape\u00f1o, lump crab meat", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 82}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 587, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "932 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium red onion, peeled and sliced", "Small handful of cilantro, with stems", "1 jalape\u00f1o pepper, stemmed and seeded", "1 red or yellow bell pepper, cored", "1/2 pound lump crab meat", "1 lightly beaten egg", "1 tablespoon mayonnaise", "1 heaping tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon curry powder", "1 teaspoon cumin", "Salt", "Juice of 1 big lemon", "1 1/2 cups bread crumbs, preferably Japanese panko", "3 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil, or as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mince together the onion, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o and bell pepper.
