{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Onion Tart With Leeks, Capers and Anchovy", "description": "Though this tart may seem complicated, it\u2019s actually rather simple to put together. Once you make the savory onion mixture, all that\u2019s left to do is spread it on a sheet of rolled-out puff pastry, top it with anchovy fillets and capers, and bake it to a golden brown. Use any kind of flaky pastry or pie dough you wish, or even spread the mixture on yeasted pizza dough. Accompany with a salad of small lettuce greens if desired. The tart is delicious served warm or at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/02/dining/02tanisrex1-tart-2/merlin_202658631_24b14e47-fc44-4cee-9860-17150b0f575c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 145}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3 medium onions, diced (about 3 cups)", "Salt and pepper", "3 medium leeks, white and tender green parts, diced (about 2 cups)", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves", "1 sheet store-bought all-butter puff pastry, thawed and rolled into a 10-inch circle (or use any favorite <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-pie-crust\">pie dough</a> recipe)", "2 teaspoons medium capers, rinsed", "8 anchovy fillets", "2 teaspoons snipped chives or chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put olive oil in a wide skillet or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat.
