Ms. Sussman, a cookbook author who lives in Tel Aviv, completes the process in just 40 minutes, and adds an unusual ingredient that mimics the flavors of a longer fermentation: fish sauce. Make the quick pickle in the dead of winter with green, unripe mangoes, then use it to brighten up anything from a simple piece of saut\u00e9ed fish to a bowl of rice and vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/01/magazine/01mag-eat/01mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 2 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments, pickles", "keywords": "fish sauce, jalape\u00f1o, mango, mustard seed", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 80}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound unripe, green-skinned mango (about 1 large or 2 medium)", "1 medium white onion, finely chopped", "1 jalape\u00f1o, chopped (seeds included)", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "3 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons yellow mustard seeds", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon ground fenugreek", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon fish sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the mango, and grate the fruit on the large holes of a box grater, directly into a medium saucepan.
