{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Persian Cod With Herbs and Tamarind", "description": "In this traditional Persian preparation for fish, called ghalieh mahi, a profusion of fresh herbs is slowly simmered with caramelized onions and tangy tamarind until the whole thing cooks down into a silky, sweet-tart sauce with a haunting flavor. This version, adapted from Nasim Alikhani from Sofreh restaurant in Brooklyn, uses both fresh and dried fenugreek, which is worth seeking out for its musky, forest-like flavor. But mint makes a good substitute if that\u2019s what you can get. You can use any firm white fish fillets here. Or try pouring the sauce over roasted cauliflower steaks for a vegetarian take.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/dining/22sofrehrex1/22sofrehrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "cilantro, cod, fenugreek, mint, parsley, scallion, tamarind, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 512, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "767 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 quart chopped parsley leaves and tender stems (from 2 to 3 bunches)", "1 quart chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems (from 2 to 3 bunches)", "1 1/2 cups chopped scallions (the whites and greens)", "1 cup chopped fresh fenugreek leaves or mint leaves", "1/3 cup dried fenugreek or mint", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 medium onion, finely diced", "5 large garlic cloves, chopped", "2 tablespoons ground turmeric", "2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes, or to taste", "1/4 to 1/3 cup tamarind paste, to taste (see note)", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "Sugar, as needed", "6 thick fillets of cod (6 to 8 ounces each), or other meaty white fish such as halibut or striped bass, patted dry", "Cooked basmati rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 12-inch skillet (choose one with a lid), heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat.
