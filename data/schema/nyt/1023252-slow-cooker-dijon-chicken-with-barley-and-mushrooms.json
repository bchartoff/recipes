{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Dijon Chicken With Barley and Mushrooms", "description": "This glossy, risottolike dish is inspired by the French bistro classic of chicken in tarragon-mustard sauce. Here, those flavors are transformed into a whole-grain, one-pot weeknight meal: The barley, mushrooms and chicken cook together first, then just before eating, finish with a bag of frozen peas and a tangy mixture of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (or sour cream) and Dijon. Make the dish vegetarian by omitting the chicken and using your favorite vegetable broth, but add about \u00bd cup more liquid, to substitute for the chicken juices.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/03/dining/sd-slow-cooker-dijon-chicken/sd-slow-cooker-dijon-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H5M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, poultry, main course", "keywords": "barley, chicken, mushroom, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 887}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups pearled barley", "1 pound sliced cremini mushrooms", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "4 cups chicken broth", "1/4 cup lemon juice (from about 1 large lemon)", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "4 thyme sprigs, leaves picked (about 2 teaspoons), or 1 teaspoon of dried thyme", "2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Black pepper", "1 (10-ounce) bag frozen peas", "1/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream", "2 heaping tablespoons smooth Dijon mustard, plus more to taste", "1/3 to \u00bd cup chopped fresh tarragon or dill, to taste", "Grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the barley, mushrooms, chicken, chicken broth, lemon juice, white wine, garlic, thyme, salt, onion powder, red-pepper flakes and several generous grinds of black pepper.
