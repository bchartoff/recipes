{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Scallops With Peaches, Corn and Tomatoes", "description": "The easiest hot-weather supper, this salad benefits from peak-summer ingredients, which need very little prep. You can throw the corn cobs and halved peaches directly on the grill, but if your scallops are small enough to fall through the grates, you should skewer them onto metal skewers or wooden skewers that have been soaked in water. The only thing worse than losing a sweet, meaty scallop into the fire would be overcooking it, so be sure to remove the scallops from the grill before they\u2019re fully opaque.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/09/dining/With-Peaches-Corn-and-Tomatoes/With-Peaches-Corn-and-Tomatoes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, corn, peach, scallops, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 167}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 168, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "584 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Olive oil, as needed", "2 ears corn", "2 peaches, halved and pitted", "Salt and pepper", "8 large scallops", "1 cup chopped fresh tomatoes", "Chopped parsley, basil or chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a charcoal or gas grill until very hot.
