Anise and fennel flavors came to mind next, as did Scandinavian licorice: \u201cYou know, they\u2019re molassesy and black, chewy and gummy,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe thought of vinegar as a way to balance that out. We thought, well, dates could take on the texture we\u2019re really looking for in that kind of candy. The pecorino came in to play a role because the dates were too sweet. And then the walnuts \u2014 kind of a no-brainer,\u201d to balance the dish and give it texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Stuart Brioza And Nicole Krasinksi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/29/dining/Medjool-Dates/Medjool-Dates-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Makes 12 date halves", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "medjool dates, pecorino, walnut, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 165, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "273 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons black sugar (dark muscovado)", "1 teaspoon molasses", "1/4 teaspoon cocoa powder", "1 teaspoon fennel seed, toasted until fragrant and lightly crushed", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "Pinch of sea salt", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sherry vinegar", "6 medjool dates, cut lengthwise in half and pitted", "4 ounces aged pecorino, shaved with a vegetable peeler", "1/4 cup walnuts, toasted and roughly chopped", "Walnut oil, for sprinkling", "Lightly cracked black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange an oven rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.
