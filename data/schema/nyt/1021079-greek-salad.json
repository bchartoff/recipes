{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Greek Salad", "description": "While diner-style Greek salads made with chopped romaine, crumbled feta and often grilled chicken have become ubiquitous in American restaurants, a traditional Greek salad, or horiatiki salata, is a simpler affair. An assembled salad of large-diced vegetables with Kalamata olives and sometimes capers, this salad has no greens at all, and the feta is served sliced on top of the salad rather than crumbled and tossed into it. A traditional Greek salad is dressed lightly with olive oil and red wine vinegar; this recipe adds garlic and oregano. To make the salad into a satisfying vegetarian main course, throw in a can of drained and rinsed chickpeas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/dining/lh-greek-salad/merlin_171784263_eafeb7f3-51a8-4931-af8a-bb8c386ded5f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, salads and dressings, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "bell pepper, capers, cucumber, feta, garlic, kalamata olives, onion, oregano, tomato, spring, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 871}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1 small garlic clove, grated or finely minced", "1/4 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 pound ripe red tomatoes, cored and cut into wedges (2 or 3 tomatoes)", "1 English cucumber, halved lengthwise and sliced 1/2-inch thick", "1 green bell pepper, cored, halved lengthwise and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "3/4 cup Kalamata olives", "1 tablespoon capers, drained", "1/2 medium yellow or red onion, very thinly sliced into rings", "8 ounces Greek feta cheese, sliced 1/2-inch thick"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl or small glass measuring cup, whisk together the vinegar, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper.
