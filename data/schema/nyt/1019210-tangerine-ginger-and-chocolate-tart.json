{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tangerine, Ginger and Chocolate Tart", "description": "This elegant tart has a tangy citrus curd nestled in a ginger shortbread crust coated with bittersweet chocolate. The chocolate not only adds flavor, it also helps the pastry stay crisp by creating a barrier between the liquid curd and the pre-baked crust. This tart is best served the day it\u2019s made, but can be stored for 24 hours in the refrigerator; after that, it starts to wilt.
