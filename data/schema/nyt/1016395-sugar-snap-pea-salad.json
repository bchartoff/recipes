{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sugar Snap Pea Salad", "description": "In this unusual summer salad, funky, creamy Camembert and crisp, juicy sugar snap peas unite make a texturally complex and very flavorful dish. You can use any washed rind cheese here as long as it\u2019s ripe enough to be spread on a plate. If you can\u2019t find a gooey-centered cheese, you can substitute a creamy goat cheese instead. Pea shoots make an ideal garnish, echoing the flavor of the sugar snaps, but if you can\u2019t get them, use any baby green or micro green in its place. If you want to work ahead, you can blanch the peas and mix up the dressing several hours ahead. But don\u2019t combine the salad ingredients until just before serving. In this dish, freshness is key.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/21/multimedia/clark-snap-pea-salad/clark-snap-pea-salad-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, cheese, pea shoots, sugar snap peas, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 61}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 248, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "607 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and black pepper", "1/2 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed", "1 teaspoon minced green garlic or 1/2 teaspoon minced regular garlic", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "4 ounces pea shoots, ends trimmed, or use baby arugula or microgreens", "10 ounces ripe, runny Camembert (or another washed- rind cheese such as \u00c9poisses or vacherin)", "1 tablespoon finely chopped chervil or chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
