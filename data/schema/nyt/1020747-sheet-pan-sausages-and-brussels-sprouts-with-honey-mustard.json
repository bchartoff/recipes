{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Sausages and Brussels Sprouts With Honey Mustard", "description": "This hearty pan of sticky, honey mustard-glazed sausages, brussels sprouts and potatoes only adds to the argument that sheet-pan dinners make the best weeknight meals. As the sausages roast, they yield a delicious fat that coats and seasons the caramelized vegetables. Use any fresh sausage you like, as long as it pairs well with the honey mustard. Feel free to substitute or add other vegetables like squash, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, carrots or cabbage. The mustard seeds and nuts provide texture and crunch, but leave them out if you prefer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/23/dining/as-sheetpan-honey-mustard-glazed-sausage-and-brussles/as-sheetpan-honey-mustard-glazed-sausage-and-brussles-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday, sausages", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, honey, potato, sausage, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1010}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh sausage, such as sweet or hot Italian, or bratwurst", "1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise", "1 pound small potatoes, like baby Yukon gold or red potatoes, halved", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 teaspoons honey", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds (optional)", "1/4 cup almonds or walnuts, chopped (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees, and place a sheet pan in the oven.
