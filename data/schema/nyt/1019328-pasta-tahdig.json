Slice and serve it warm, showered with Parmesan, or alongside meatballs or a bright green salad.\u00a0Or let it cool to room temperature, wrap it up and take it to a picnic \u2014 it will erase every lackluster potluck pasta salad from memory.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/27/magazine/27Eat2/27Eat2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "noodles", "keywords": "main course, parmesan, spaghetti, tomato sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 794}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 296, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "488 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1 pound spaghetti or capellini (angel hair)", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 cups tomato sauce", "1 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "Optional: 1 tablespoon Calabrian chile paste or 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat.
