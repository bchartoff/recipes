{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Crumb Cake", "description": "This pumpkin-packed crumb cake is everything that is wonderful about fall baking. Warmly spiced, moist pumpkin cake topped with spicy, crispy streusel and topped with an optional but delicious glaze. It is just the thing for an afternoon snack, and just as good for breakfast the next day. You can use any pumpkin spice blend you like, but the homemade recipe included below includes a bit of cardamom, which isn\u2019t usually included in pumpkin spice blends, but brings a hint of citrusy floral flavor. The pumpkin-spice glaze is optional, but if you have the time, don\u2019t skip it. It adds a nice extra hint of sweetness and spice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/30/dining/ya-pumpkin-crumb-cake/merlin_213556065_6ec21873-9546-4068-a54c-6c281548d75e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 (8-inch-square or 9-inch-round) cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, light brown sugar, make-ahead, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, pumpkin spice, fall, halloween", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 436}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 (packed) cup/100 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 cup/64 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon store-bought or homemade pumpkin spice blend (see Tip)", "Pinch of salt\u00a0", "1/4 cup/56 grams unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 (packed) cup/200 grams light brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 cup/230 grams canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "1/4 cup/56 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/4 cup neutral oil", "1 tablespoon store-bought or homemade pumpkin spice blend (see Tip)", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/75 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 teaspoon pumpkin spice blend", "Pinch of salt", "3 to 5 teaspoons milk (any kind will do)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees.
