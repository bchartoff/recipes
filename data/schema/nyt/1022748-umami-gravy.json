{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Umami Gravy", "description": "The last thing you want to do on Thanksgiving Day is rush to make a gravy from the turkey\u2019s hot pan drippings while the rest of the dishes get cold. Instead, this make-ahead gravy, inspired by the one my friend Lauren Kuhn makes at her annual Friendsgiving, relies on a base of caramelized red onion and gets its body from flour, milk and vegetable stock. (Stock concentrate paste is an especially useful pantry staple to keep on hand to make stock quickly.) Nutritional yeast is an optional umami enhancer that adds nuance and a rich, cheesy depth. Keep this covered in the refrigerator until it\u2019s ready to eat, then on Thanksgiving Day, reheat it on the stove or in the microwave. Drizzle it over everything.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15BEGINNERREX7-GRAVY/merlin_197340915_f84e09d3-4e30-4092-817b-e7dce5d5a68d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies, side dish", "keywords": "milk, red onion, vegetable stock, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1476}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Salt", "Pinch of dried oregano", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 cups vegetable stock", "1/4 cup whole milk", "1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional, but very good)", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
