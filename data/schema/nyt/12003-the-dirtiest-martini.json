Strain into a chilled martini glass, and garnish with the olive skewer and basil leaf. *To infuse the vodka, place 10 basil leaves in a 750-ml bottle of organic vodka (Rain vodka, distilled in Kentucky from organic corn, is a good choice) for two hours. Be careful not to overinfuse. You want a mild flavor and fragrance, not basil cologne."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12003-the-dirtiest-martini"}
