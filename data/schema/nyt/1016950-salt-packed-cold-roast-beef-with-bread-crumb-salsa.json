{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salt-Packed Cold Roast Beef With Bread-Crumb Salsa", "description": "When you cook a large piece of meat or a whole fish in a thick crust of salt, the crust provides both gentle heat and even seasoning. For beef tenderloin, a relatively bland cut, salt-baking is easy and ensures a particularly tasty dish. Serving the perfectly plain, perfectly cooked beef alongside a riotous crunchy salad of fried croutons, tomatoes, lemon segments and scallions makes for a lively main course.\n\nThis recipe \u2013 reproduced verbatim from \"Prune,\" the first cookbook by the New York chef Gabrielle Hamilton \u2013 isn't like other recipes. (This makes sense, because Ms. Hamilton isn't like other chefs \u2013 self-taught, with a quirky menu that reflects her American childhood, French parentage and global palate.) It reflects the book, which is written more like a kitchen manual for Prune's sous chefs than a cookbook for a home kitchen. The recipe may seem long, but with her helpful detail and entertaining language, cooking becomes a pleasure.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/05/dining/05JPCOOKBOOK2/05JPCOOKBOOK2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beef tenderloin, bread crumbs, cherry tomatoes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 19}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 770, "unsaturatedFatContent": "43 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "856 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["24 ounces trimmed and clean beef tenderloin", "1 tablespoon grapeseed oil", "2 teaspoons finely and freshly ground black pepper", "2 to 3 pounds kosher salt (Diamond Crystal only)", "1 1/2 cups cold water", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "6 ounces day-old peasant bread, torn into free-form smallish croutons", "1 pound assorted sweet cherry tomatoes, split in half", "1 bunch scallions, sliced thinly in rings, from the white all the way up through as much of the green stalk as is edible", "4 small cloves fresh and sticky new garlic, thinly sliced", "1 packed tablespoon plus 1 packed teaspoon salt-packed anchovies, rinsed, filleted and then minced", "2 lemons, zested, supremed and deseeded, and all the juice from what\u2019s left of the skeleton after supreming the segments", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1/2 cup clean and dry flat-leaf Italian parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the beef:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large, heavy cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 5 whole minutes and make sure the hood is on.
