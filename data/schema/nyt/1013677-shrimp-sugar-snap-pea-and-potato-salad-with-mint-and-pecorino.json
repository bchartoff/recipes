{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp, Sugar-Snap Pea and Potato Salad With Mint and Pecorino", "description": "This recipe breaks the taboo of combining seafood and cheese. This salad of blanched shrimp, new potatoes and crisp disks of sugar-snap peas is perfectly adequate. It is vibrant from fresh mint, tangy from red-wine vinegar and mustard in the vinaigrette, sweet from the shrimp and earthy from the potatoes, but a few shards of young pecorino add the saline funk that brings this dish together. The cheese will practically melt into the salad, adding a glossy complexity. (Another young, semifirm sheep\u2019s milk cheese would work. So would aged pecorino, but use less since it\u2019s saltier. ) ", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/10/dining/10shrimp/10shrimp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "pecorino, shrimp, sugar snap peas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 396, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "945 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound sugar-snap peas", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "3 tablespoons red-wine vinegar, plus more for serving", "1 1/4 teaspoons coarse sea salt", "3/4 teaspoon pepper, plus more for serving", "1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 pound new fingerling or small yellow potatoes", "1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled", "3/4 cup loosely packed mint leaves", "3/4 cup coarsely grated young pecorino (or 1/2 cup aged)", "Crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim and string the peas, then thinly slice them crosswise.
