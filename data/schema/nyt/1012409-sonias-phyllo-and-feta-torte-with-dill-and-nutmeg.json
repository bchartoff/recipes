The only challenge is finding the right Greek feta, by which we mean something not too salty but not too mild. Think of the layering of the phyllo sheets as a meditative exercise, clearing the clutter of the week and preparing you for something delicious. Gild it with Greek honey for a welcome touch of sweetness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/dining/fetatorte-still/fetatorte-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, main course, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 33}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 501, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "794 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound Greek feta cheese, crumbled", "3 cups cottage cheese", "3 large eggs", "1/3 cup chopped fresh dill", "1/4 cup grated Romano cheese", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 1-pound box phyllo dough, thawed overnight in refrigerator if necessary", "1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, melted", "Greek honey, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
