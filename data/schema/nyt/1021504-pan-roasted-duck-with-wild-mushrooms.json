{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Roasted Duck With Wild Mushrooms", "description": "Magret is the term used for the large breasts of a Muscovy duck, found at many butcher shops and supermarkets or easily purchased online. Each breast weighs about 12 ounces, enough for 2 portions.They are best served rare or medium-rare, like a beef steak. If using smaller duck breasts, reduce the cooking time accordingly. The deeply flavored sauce is made from dried wild mushrooms and a mixture of cultivated mushrooms saut\u00e9ed with garlic and parsley finishes the dish. If wild chanterelles or porcini are available, by all means, add them to the mixture, too. Mashed squash or sweet potato would make a nice accompaniment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/14/dining/09tanisrex2-duck2/merlin_178081509_5c177dd3-b55e-4f0a-bd61-29a45c6d9134-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "duck, mushroom, wine, fall, new year\u2019s day, valentine\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 254}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup crumbled or chopped dried wild mushrooms, such as porcini or morels (about 1 ounce)", "3 (12-ounce) boneless, skin-on Muscovy duck breasts", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1 large thyme sprig", "1 bay leaf", "1 pound sliced cultivated mushrooms, such as king trumpet, oyster or shiitake", "2 to 3 small garlic cloves, minced", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse dried mushrooms to remove sand or dirt and place in a bowl.
