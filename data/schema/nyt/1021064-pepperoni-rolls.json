{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pepperoni Rolls", "description": "Found throughout West Virginia, the pepperoni roll was born in the early 20th century in the north-central part of the state as a convenient lunch for Italian coal miners. Giuseppe Argiro is credited with first selling the rolls commercially, sometime between 1927 and 1938, and his Country Club Bakery, in Fairmont, W.Va., still uses his recipe, the standard by which all other rolls in the state are judged. The recipe remains a secret, but this version \u2014 from the chef Travis Milton and featured in Ronni Lundy\u2019s cookbook, \u201cVictuals\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2016) \u2014 is a close approximation. Look for a hunk of pepperoni to slice into sticks, as it gives the roll more chew. Many West Virginians add cheese to their versions, so feel free to experiment once you\u2019re comfortable with the recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/22/dining/sb-pepperoni-rolls/sb-pepperoni-rolls-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 rolls", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breads, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "maple syrup, pepperoni, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 102}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 milliliters warm water (110 to 115 degrees)", "2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (from 1 individual packet)", "1 teaspoon maple syrup, sorghum syrup or honey", "2 3/4 cups/350 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon olive oil, plus more as needed", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 (8-ounce/225-gram) pepperoni stick or 6 ounces pepperoni slices", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the warm water to a measuring cup.
