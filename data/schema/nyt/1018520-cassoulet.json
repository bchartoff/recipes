{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cassoulet", "description": "This slow-cooked casserole of white beans and several kinds of meat has long been considered the pinnacle of regional French home cooking. It takes planning (you\u2019ll need to find all the ingredients), time and a good deal of culinary stamina. But the voluptuous mix of aromatic beans surrounding rich chunks of duck confit, sausages, roasted pork and lamb and a crisp salt pork crust is well worth the effort. Serve this with a green salad. It doesn\u2019t need any other accompaniment, and you wouldn\u2019t have room for it, anyway.
