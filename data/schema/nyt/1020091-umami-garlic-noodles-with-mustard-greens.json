{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Umami Garlic Noodles With Mustard Greens", "description": "The key to this heady noodle dish, adapted from\u00a0\u201cVietnamese Food Any Day\u201d\u00a0(Ten Speed Press, 2019), is to build complexity by layering umami flavors in the pan. The cookbook\u2019s author, Andrea Nguyen, starts with ingredients that are familiar to many pan-fried noodle dishes: oyster sauce, fish sauce, mushrooms, garlic. But then, in a brilliant move, she augments it all with a big dollop of salted, European-style cultured butter to add both creaminess and acidity. There\u2019s also a touch of\u00a0monosodium glutamate (MSG)\u00a0in the mix, which you can buy in Asian markets or other supermarkets sold under the name Accent Flavor Enhancer. It has a salty sweetness that deepens all the other flavors. But if you\u2019d rather not use it, nutritional yeast also works well. If you can\u2019t get mustard greens, substitute baby kale or spinach.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/13/dining/umami-noodle-alt/umami-noodle-alt-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, noodles", "keywords": "main course, monosodium glutamate, mushroom, mustard greens, ramen", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 409}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1123 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "Kosher salt, as needed", "10 ounces dried Chinese wheat noodles or Japanese ramen", "1 tablespoon oyster sauce", "2 teaspoons fish sauce", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon\u00a0monosodium glutamate (MSG), or use 1/2 teaspoon chicken stock base or 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "5 tablespoons salted, European-style (cultured) butter", "10 ounces sliced shiitake or cremini mushrooms", "1 large bunch mustard greens, stems and leaves, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon minced shallot", "Chopped cilantro, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, cover garlic with 1 tablespoon water.
