{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Onion Dip With Frizzled Leeks", "description": "Though onion-powder dip does give me a teenage memory buzz, I remember equally well the time I first slow-cooked a batch of onions, watching them easily turn from white to pale yellow to walnut (at which point you have to start minding them with care). These caramelized babies form the basis of scores of top-notch dishes, from onion soup to real Indian stews and sauces, but nowhere are they better used than as the basis for a dip: stir them, along with some lemon juice and thyme leaves, into yogurt or sour cream, and you\u2019re on your way to dip nirvana. And just as your mother \u2014 or at least mine \u2014 made onion-sour-cream dip better with (French\u2019s) canned fried onions, you can also take that idea back a hundred years and improve it: fry some leeks or shallots until they\u2019re crisp. If you can manage to not eat those as you remove them from the pan, they enhance the dip even more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, condiments, dips and spreads", "keywords": "gluten-free, leek, onion, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 200}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 178, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "445 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds onions (6 to 8 medium), chopped (5 to 6 cups)", "6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "1 1/2 cups whole-milk yogurt", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste", "2 leeks, trimmed, cleaned and julienned or thinly sliced", "Crudit\u00e9s or crackers for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the onions in a large skillet over medium heat.
