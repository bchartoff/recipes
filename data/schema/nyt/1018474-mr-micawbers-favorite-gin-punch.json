Its combination of\u00a0spirit,\u00a0warmth and spice\u00a0will bring to mind a hot toddy, and it's fragrant and flavorful enough to supplant the more familiar whiskey-based version\u00a0\u2014\u00a0at least for a season.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/11/magazine/11drink3/11drink3-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "gin, madeira, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 12}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 lemon", "1 teaspoon dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon honey", "Pinch ground cinnamon", "1 clove", "Water just off the boil", "1 1/2 oz.
