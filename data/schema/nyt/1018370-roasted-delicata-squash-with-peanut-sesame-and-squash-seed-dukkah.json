{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Delicata Squash with Peanut, Sesame and Squash Seed Dukkah", "description": "Steven Satterfield, an Atlanta chef with a deep love for green peanut oil, developed this recipe for a coming book on goobers from Short Stack Editions. Green peanuts are nothing more than raw peanuts. They have a fresh, vegetal flavor, and retain their greenness when cold-pressed into oil. Mr. Satterfield's spin on the Egyptian condiment called dukkah centers on peanuts and benne seeds (the preferred term in the South for sesame seeds), two regulars in many Southern kitchens. The spice and nut mixture brings life to delicata squash, whose tender skin doesn\u2019t need peeling. You can substitute olive oil for the green oil when roasting the squash, and the dukkah will keep in an airtight container in the pantry for a month. Pull it out to sprinkle over greens, meat, fish or grilled bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/02/dining/02PEANUTSJP5/02PEANUTSJP5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, delicata squash, green peanut oil, peanut, sesame seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 30}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 324, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "429 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium or 3 small delicata squash (about 2 1/2 pounds total)", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "6 tablespoons green peanut oil", "1/2 cup sesame seeds, toasted", "1/2 cup plain, dry-roasted peanuts", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
