{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Chicken With 20 Cloves of Garlic", "description": "This weeknight-friendly version of the French classic \u2014 chicken with 40 cloves of garlic \u2014 has half the amount of garlic, because a slow cooker doesn\u2019t get quite hot enough to mellow out 40 whole cloves. This dish cooks on high for three hours, but you can lengthen the cook time to six hours using the low heat setting. In that case, cut the garlic further to 15 cloves, because it may taste a bit stronger when cooked at that lower temperature. The beans end up pleasantly soupy, in a sauce rich with chicken juices and wine. The herbs stirred in at the end impart a welcome freshness. This is best served in shallow bowls, with good bread on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/dining/sdg-slow-cooker-chicken-and-beans/merlin_168064374_2878e573-a208-49ee-ba0e-62a3ec8fe7f1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, one pot, poultry", "keywords": "cannellini beans, chicken thigh, garlic, lemon, white wine, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 468}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (28-ounce) can or 2 (14-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained", "20 garlic cloves (about 2 heads of garlic), smashed", "1/3 cup white wine", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar", "2 fresh thyme sprigs or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (4 to 6 large thighs)", "1/2 lemon, juiced (about 1 tablespoon)", "2 scallions, trimmed, white and light green parts thinly sliced", "1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the beans, garlic, wine, oil, vinegar, thyme and red-pepper flakes in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker.
