The roasted bell peppers turn sweet and golden, while olives add a salty note that goes nicely with the mild, flaky fish and a garlicky parsley dressing. If you can\u2019t find hake, cod or flounder make fine substitutes, though you may have to adjust the roasting time. The thicker the fillets, the longer they will take to cook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/dining/mc-fish/merlin_167226222_1dc4a41a-84b9-4ea4-80f2-deaaf2d8977b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "bell pepper, hake, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 859}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "508 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small bunch lemon thyme or regular thyme", "1 1/2 pounds hake fillets", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "3 large bell peppers, preferably 1 red, 1 orange and 1 yellow, thinly sliced", "4 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1/4 cup pitted, sliced black or green olives, or a combination", "1 teaspoon sherry vinegar, plus more to taste", "1 garlic clove, grated", "1 cup loosely packed Italian parsley leaves, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
