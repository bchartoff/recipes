My family was from Abruzzi, and my mother always used the recipe from her older sister. You can scent these cookies with orange, almond or lemon or just vanilla, but we always made plenty with anise at Christmas. You can use a simple stove-top pizzelle maker or an electric one. I prefer the kind without a non-stick coating. A little shot of cooking spray or a wipe with some cooking oil helps prime the press. Like pancakes, you will probably throw away the first one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/03/dining/03COOKFIGHT7/03COOKFIGHT7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 4 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, cookies and bars", "keywords": "anise, side dish, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 46, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "31 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/210 grams flour, plus a little more if batter is too thin", "2 teaspoons/15 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon/6 grams salt", "3 eggs", "3/4 cup/150 grams sugar", "1/4 pound/113 grams butter, melted", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla", "1/2 teaspoon/2.5 milliliters anise extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together flour, baking powder and salt in a small bowl.
