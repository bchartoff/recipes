{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Pumpkin Roti Filling", "description": "The <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/3352-roti\">roti</a>, the delectable, fat, folded-up curry sandwich that is Indian Trinidad's main contribution to world cuisine, is a thoroughly creole invention that has no equivalent in India. (The word roti, in India, describes a kind of griddle bread.) Trinidad's roti begins with an enormous, almost pizza-sized flat bread that's often layered with a thin coating of powdery ground yellow peas. In Trinidad's top roti shops along El Socorro and the Eastern Main Road, the bread is slapped on the griddle when you order; you can watch it hiss and bubble as you wait. Then it's tucked like a blanket around a meat, fish or vegetable curry, wrapped in wax paper and foil, and the hot square package placed in a paper bag with a stack of napkins.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daisann Mclane"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Filling for 4 rotis", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean, indian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "ghee, pumpkin, spices, gluten-free, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 111, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "679 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon vegetable oil or ghee", "1/2-inch knob of peeled, fresh ginger", "1 cinnamon stick", "2 1/2 pounds peeled and seeded Jamaican pumpkin (see note), cut into 1-inch cubes (about 3 1/4 pounds unpeeled pumpkin)", "1 teaspoon garam masala (preferably Turban or Chief brand)", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil or ghee in a large pot over high heat.
