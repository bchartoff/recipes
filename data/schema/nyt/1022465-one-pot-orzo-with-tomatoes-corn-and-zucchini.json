{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Orzo With Tomatoes, Corn and Zucchini", "description": "This recipe is inspired by the tail end of summer, when fresh produce and herbs abound but the heat waves are finally starting to relent. And while this dish makes a wonderful stage for the season\u2019s produce at its peak, it can also turn sad-looking February vegetables into a sauce that makes it feel like summer. The trick is to saut\u00e9 the tomatoes slowly, until they\u2019ve collapsed and become deeply sweet and fragrant. The orzo cooks right in the sauce, which cuts down on the dishes and allows the pasta to absorb the flavor as it cooks. If you prefer a larger pasta shape, stick to the traditional method of boiling pasta for best results, and save some pasta water to help loosen the sauce.\n\n\nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/10/dining/lh-orzo-with-tomatoes-corn-and-zucchini/lh-orzo-with-tomatoes-corn-and-zucchini-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, pastas, main course, side dish", "keywords": "basil, cherry tomatoes, corn, mozzarella, orzo, skillet, zucchini, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2233}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 Vidalia or yellow onion, chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "Black pepper, to taste", "1 medium zucchini (about 8 ounces), halved lengthwise, seeded and 1/2-inch diced", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "2 pints cherry tomatoes, halved", "1/3 cup torn fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 1/4 cups orzo", "Kernels from one ear of corn (about 1/2 cup)", "1 cup torn or medium-diced fresh mozzarella (about 5 ounces)", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat olive oil in a large (12-inch) skillet, for which you have a lid, set over medium.
