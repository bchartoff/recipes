The alcohol dissolves some of the gluten proteins in the wheat flour, so the crust doesn\u2019t get tough and boils off faster than water, so the batter dries out, crisps and browns quickly, before the delicate fish inside overcooks. The coating ends up especially crunchy \u2014 with each bite, you crush many thin layers of crust.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Harold McGee"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/22/dining/HM-fried-fish-with-vodka-and-beer-Batter/merlin_197671230_7efca978-8077-4b25-90a4-7e1c061d3e6d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, main course", "keywords": "fish, lager, vodka", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 272}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds (about 4 large fillets) turbot, sole or flounder", "Salt and black pepper", "1 1/4 cups white rice flour, plus more for dusting", "2 to 3 quarts vegetable oil, for deep-frying", "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 1/4 cups vodka", "1 1/4 cups lager beer"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse fish fillets, and dry with paper towels.
