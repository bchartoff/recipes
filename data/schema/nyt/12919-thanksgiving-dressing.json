{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thanksgiving Dressing", "description": "The question has dogged Thanksgiving cooks practically since Norman Rockwell painted \u201cFreedom From Want\u201d in 1942 and transformed the harvest feast into an American ideal: Is it stuffing or dressing? Grandmother knows: it is stuffing only if it is cooked inside the bird. Otherwise it is dressing. This classic version, made with bread, celery, onions, apples, chestnuts, thyme and sage, is relatively simple to execute. It would do well at almost any time of the year as an accompaniment to roast chicken or pork. Crucial is the copious use of turkey broth, or a good chicken broth, to help meld the flavors together. Also necessary is an understanding that the cooking should last long enough to crisp the exterior without burning it, while not going on so long as to dry out the dish. When in doubt, add a splash more broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/12/dining/12THANKSGIVING/12THANKSGIVING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apple, bread, chestnut, fall, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 632}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 287, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "486 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large Spanish onion, peeled and diced", "2 ribs celery, cleaned and diced", "2 apples, preferably tart, like Granny Smith or Cortland, peeled, cored and diced", "1 cup peeled chestnuts, roughly chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper to taste", "3 sprigs fresh thyme, stems removed and leaves chopped", "1 dozen fresh sage leaves, stems removed and leaves chopped", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 dash hot-pepper sauce, or to taste", "1 loaf decent-quality bread, a day or two old, torn into small pieces", "2 eggs, beaten", "1/2 cup chopped parsley", "1 to 2 cups turkey or chicken stock (see <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/12922/Serious-Turkey-Stock.html'>recipe</a>); if using store-bought broth, use low-sodium variety"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
