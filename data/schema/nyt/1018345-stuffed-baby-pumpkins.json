{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffed Baby Pumpkins", "description": "Sarah Frey, who sells more pumpkins than anyone else in America, often entertains retailers and produce executives at her farmhouse in southern Illinois. She likes to serve white baby pumpkins stuffed with spinach and cheese. Along with their orange counterparts, mini-pumpkins are often considered more decorative than culinary. But they make a dramatic side dish that can be stuffed with any manner of fillings that complement the layer of soft, cooked pumpkin that clings to the skin. This recipe uses Gruy\u00e8re and kale, with pine nuts for texture and red pepper flakes for heat. The hardest part is carving off the pumpkin tops and cleaning out the tiny seeds. Bake for an hour, then test; it is hard to predict how much time each pumpkin takes to become tender when pierced with a fork.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/12/dining/12PUMPKIN5-WEB/12PUMPKIN5-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "bread crumbs, gruy\u00e8re, heavy cream, kale, pumpkin, fall, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 105}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 224, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "164 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 mini-pumpkins, preferably the white variety", "1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to prepare the shells", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 scallions (about 1/3 cup), chopped", "1 large garlic clove, finely chopped", "4 cups baby kale or stemmed and roughly chopped lacinato kale (about 4 ounces)", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 cup white bread crumbs, lightly toasted", "2/3 cups shredded Gruy\u00e8re cheese", "1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1/4 cup heavy cream", "1 tablespoon olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
