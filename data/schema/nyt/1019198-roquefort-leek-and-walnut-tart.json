{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roquefort, Leek and Walnut Tart", "description": "The open-face Alsatian tarte flamb\u00e9e can be as versatile as a quiche. Most often it\u2019s given classic treatment, with bacon and onions on a pastry-lined bed of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and fromage blanc. But why stick to tradition? You can make it with mushrooms, omit the bacon and dot it with caviar, add smoked salmon, pave it with zucchini slices, and explore other cheeses, including Taleggio and ch\u00e8vre. Here\u2019s an assertive version that keeps the bacon but opts for Roquefort cheese, leeks and walnuts. And instead of pizza dough, which is a typical underpinning, for a more expedient result, you can make it with pie pastry.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/14/dining/14pairingrex/14pairingrex-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pies and tarts", "keywords": "bacon, leeks, roquefort cheese, walnut, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 16}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 240, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "167 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/180 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 large egg yolk", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 strips thick-cut smoked bacon, diced (about 2 ounces)", "1 cup chopped leeks, white part with a little light green", "1/3 cup chopped walnuts", "4 ounces Roquefort cheese, or other blue-veined cheese", "3 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Blend together flour, baking powder and half the salt in a bowl or a food processor.
