{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet and Sour Stir-Fried Radishes With Their Greens", "description": "The bitterness of radish greens pairs wells with a sweet-and-sour sauce in this stir-fry. We always toss out radish greens, but we shouldn\u2019t. They are as nutritious as any green, and they have a pleasantly bitter flavor that is very much like that of turnip greens, which are a close relative. The bitterness works very well against a sweet and \nsour stir-fry sauce. The radishes should be barely cooked. This is a great dish for large, colorful breakfast radishes. The big bunches I get at my farmers\u2019 market weigh a pound, sometimes a little more. Use 2 bunches if yours are smaller.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/17/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4M", "recipeYield": "Serves 3 to 4 as a side dish", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, vegan, vegetarian, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 71}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 67, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "251 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 generous bunch large radishes, with greens (about 1 pound total), or 2 smaller bunches", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon rice vinegar", "2 teaspoons agave nectar or honey", "2 tablespoons chicken stock, vegetable stock or water", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon peanut, canola, sunflower, or grape seed oil", "2 teaspoons minced garlic", "2 teaspoons minced ginger", "1 bunch scallions, chopped, white and green parts separated", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "1 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut away greens from radishes and trim off bottoms of the stems.
