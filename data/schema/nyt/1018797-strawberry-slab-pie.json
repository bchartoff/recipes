{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Slab Pie", "description": "On Juneteenth, which celebrates the abolition of slavery in the United States, the picnic table overflows with summertime pies and red foods, a symbol of perseverance. That makes this festive strawberry slab pie ideal for Juneteenth, though it'd be welcome anytime in berry season. The rectangular pie is made in a quarter sheet pan; if you don't have one, use a comparably sized casserole dish. Cracked black pepper in the crust and fresh ginger in the filling add a bit of spice. This isn't an especially sugary dessert, so if you want something sweeter, top it with vanilla ice cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nicole Taylor"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/20/dining/14JUNETEENTH4/14JUNETEENTH4-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "buttermilk, grapefruit, strawberries, dessert, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 261}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 333, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "160 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons/360 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out dough", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "1 teaspoon cracked black pepper", "1 cup/226 grams cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut into 1/2-inch cubes, plus more for buttering the pan", "3/4 cup/177 milliliters ice water", "2 tablespoons buttermilk", "3 pounds/1.3 kilograms fresh strawberries, small berries cut in half and larger berries cut in quarters (see note)", "3 to 4 tablespoons/40 grams loosely packed dark brown sugar, depending on how sweet your berries are", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon grapefruit zest", "1 1/2 teaspoons grapefruit juice", "1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/8 teaspoon coarse kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, 2 teaspoons granulated sugar, the salt and the pepper.
