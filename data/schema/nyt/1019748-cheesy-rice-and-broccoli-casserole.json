{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Rice and Broccoli Casserole", "description": "In this casserole, a homemade cheese sauce that\u2019s good enough to toss with pasta replaces the canned creamed soup. When you mix in broccoli florets and cooked rice, then top the whole thing with crushed crackers and more Cheddar, you get a gooey, addictive holiday side with a crisp top. Use white or orange Cheddar or a mix of the 2, aiming for a range of 4 to 5 cups, based on how rich and cheesy you\u2019d like it. And while this does contain a lot of broccoli, you\u2019ll probably want to serve a salad on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jampel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/13/dining/sj-broccoli-rice-casserole/sj-broccoli-rice-casserole-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, casseroles", "keywords": "broccoli, cheddar, ritz crackers, scallion, white rice, fall, winter, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 156}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 636, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "1010 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup unsalted butter, plus more for greasing dish", "Kosher salt", "3 to 4 large heads broccoli (about 3 1/2 pounds), trimmed of long stalks and cut into small florets", "1 1/2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes", "2 bunches scallions", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "4 1/2 cups whole milk", "5 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese", "3 cups cooked long-grain white rice", "2 cups coarsely crushed Ritz crackers"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees and butter a deep 9-by-13-inch baking dish."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
