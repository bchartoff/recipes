{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bariis Iskukaris (Somali-Style Rice)", "description": "Somali-style rice, when prepared for festive occasions, can be a satisfying meal on its own: The rice is cooked in a rich stock and often jeweled with pieces of meat and vegetables. This version of the dish comes from Ayaan and Idyl Mohallim, twin sisters who make their own xawaash, an aromatic spice mixture that is layered with fenugreek and turmeric. The finished rice is also generously seasoned with saffron, as well as softened peppers and raisins. At Thanksgiving, the rice is a versatile side with roast turkey and vegetables, and the day after, it's a great base for leftovers. You could easily use a vegetable stock in place of a meat stock for a vegetarian version, and add more vegetables to the topping. The Mohallim sisters, on occasion, add blanched green beans to the mix.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/dining/COOKING-RICE2/COOKING-SOMALIAN2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "rice, spices, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups Basmati rice", "1/2 cup olive oil", "1 large yellow onion, chopped", "3 cloves garlic, minced", "2 cinnamon sticks", "5 whole green cardamom pods", "10 whole cloves", "2 teaspoons xawaash spice mix (see below)", "8 cups chicken stock", "1 teaspoon saffron threads, finely chopped", "1 cup raisins", "Salt", "1 tablespoon cumin seeds", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "2 teaspoons dried whole sage", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 1/4 teaspoons ground ginger", "8 green cardamom pods", "10 whole cloves", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/3 cinnamon stick", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 red onion, peeled and thinly sliced", "1/4 cup raisins", "1 red bell pepper, cored and thinly sliced", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak rice in cold water 30 to 45 minutes, then drain."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, prepare the xawaash: Combine all the spices in a spice grinder and finely grind.
