{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Biryani", "description": "In India, you\u2019re just as likely to have biryani as a lunchtime delivery at the office as you are to see it as a stunning centerpiece at a wedding feast. The dish is pervasive, with many modern interpretations and regional permutations rooted in Muslim communities of the subcontinent. Hyderabad is famous for its style of biryani, which traditionally involves a layer of raw meat and gravy that cooks the rice as it steams in a tightly sealed pot. This Sindhi-style biryani is the one I make for special Sunday lunches and parties. With multiple layers of parcooked rice, fresh herbs, caramelized onion, saffron-infused milk and braised lamb, it\u2019s a project, but a rewarding one.\u00a0Two tips: Meat on the bone isn\u2019t a rule, but it\u2019s consistently better than meat off the bone. Potatoes are welcome; add a pound of small boiled potatoes to the cooked meat if you want to stretch the pot and feed a few extra people.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/11/dining/09Indianrex10/merlin_169211892_aad6eff1-2659-451c-9405-f50fce820228-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, meat", "keywords": "basmati rice, ginger, lamb chops, lamb shoulder, onion, saffron, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 148}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 green finger chiles (or serrano chiles), stems removed", "8 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 (4-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled", "2 medium yellow onions, peeled and quartered", "2 Roma tomatoes, quartered", "1 cup full-fat yogurt", "1 cup fresh mint leaves", "1 cup fresh cilantro leaves", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon Kashmiri chile powder, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "2 1/2 to 3 pounds lamb chops (or boneless or bone-in lamb shoulder pieces)", "3 (1/2-inch) Indian cinnamon sticks, or 1 large cinnamon stick", "12 whole black peppercorns", "6 cloves", "6 green cardamom pods", "1 tablespoon garam masala", "1 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "2 yellow onions, thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Kosher salt", "3 cups basmati rice", "6 tablespoons whole milk", "1/2 teaspoon saffron threads", "2 cups mixed fresh cilantro and mint leaves", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the lamb marinade: Add the finger chiles, garlic and ginger to a food processor and process until finely chopped.
