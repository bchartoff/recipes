{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Peppers With Lemon Ricotta", "description": "Roasted peppers are culinary chameleons \u2014 they have their own distinctive flavor, yet they mix easily with so many ingredients. In this recipe, the peppers are slicked with olive oil and vinegar (use either sherry or balsamic) and served with ricotta that\u2019s enlivened with lemon zest and juice. If you\u2019ve got it, add also the finely chopped rind of a salt-preserved lemon to the ricotta. Because the peppers can be made ahead and the ricotta is better chilled, this is a great recipe for a dinner party \u2014 it takes just a few minutes to assemble the dish at serving time and it looks good whether you arrange it on a platter or take the time to make individual plates.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/29/magazine/29Paris-recipes2/29Paris-recipes2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, preserved lemon, red bell pepper, ricotta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 199, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "458 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 bell peppers, red or yellow", "2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 cups ricotta", "1 lemon", "1 tablespoon chopped preserved lemon rind (optional)", "Fine sea salt", "Freshly ground pepper", "Sherry or balsamic vinegar, for serving", "Minced chives or basil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to 425 degrees.
