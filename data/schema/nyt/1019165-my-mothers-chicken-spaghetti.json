It consisted of spaghetti or spaghettini and sometimes vermicelli baked in a casserole, layered with a tomato and cream sauce, a meat sauce, boneless chicken and two kinds of grated cheese.\u00a0It was almost always served when large numbers were invited for special occasions.\u00a0Subsequent to the program we received numerous requests for the recipe and discovered with some astonishment that we had somehow never had occasion to use it in a story.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Craig Claiborne"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "pastas, poultry", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 12}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 668, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "863 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 three\u2010and\u2010one\u2010half pound chicken with giblets", "Chicken broth to cover", "Salt to taste", "3 cups canned tomatoes, preferably Italian peeled tomatoes", "7 tablespoons butter", "3 tablespoons flour", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/2 pound fresh mushrooms", "2 cups finely chopped onions", "1 1/2 cups finely chopped celery", "1 1/2 cups chopped green pepper", "1 tablespoon or more finely minced garlic", "1/4 pound ground beef", "1/4 pound ground pork", "1 bay leaf", "1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes, optional", "1 pound spaghetti or spaghettini", "1/2 pound Cheddar cheese, grated", "2 to 2 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the chicken with neck, gizzard, heart and liver in a kettle and add chicken broth to cover and salt to taste.
