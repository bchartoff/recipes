Some recipes call for only four ingredients: flour, shortening, sugar and lime zest. But this one goes a step further, adding salt and vanilla to amplify the other flavors. The shortening is essential here, and traditional to the recipe. Pair a cookie with a little dulce de leche or guava paste, or serve them alongside a strong cafecito.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Krysten Chambrot"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08COOKIESREX18-TORTICAS/merlin_198248679_4d1feb95-5d07-4044-9802-9b9a3f539782-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "cuban", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "christmas, christmas cookie, lime zest, shortening", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 220}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/185 grams vegetable shortening", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Zest of 3 limes (about 1\u00bd tablespoons lime zest)", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl and using a wooden spoon, combine the shortening and the sugar until well incorporated.
