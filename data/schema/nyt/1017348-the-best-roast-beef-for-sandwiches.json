{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Best Roast Beef for Sandwiches", "description": "The best cut of roast beef for sandwiches isn\u2019t necessarily the same as what you\u2019d want hot from the oven. A hot roast demands plenty of marbling so that the rich fat can melt and baste the meat with its goodness. Roast beef sandwiches work better made from a leaner cut, preferably one with a mineral, earthy taste and a nice chew. A top loin roast is ideal. It\u2019s got plenty of brawny flavor, and all of the fat is on the surface, which you can easily trim off after the meat is cooked. Here, the beef is roasted low and slow to ensure rare, juicy meat. This said, if you want a more economical cut, use bottom, top or eye round here instead. Just adjust the roasting time if the cut is larger or smaller. As long as you pull the meat out of the oven when it reaches between 125 and 130 degrees, you\u2019ll get nicely rare meat.  \n\nMore <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/topics/sandwiches\">sandwich recipes</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/07/multimedia/clark-roast-beef/clark-roast-beef-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 10 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts, sandwiches", "keywords": "boneless beef loin, rosemary, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 470}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 285, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "270 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 small garlic cloves, grated", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons black pepper", "2 teaspoons rosemary leaves", "2 1/2 pounds boneless beef top loin roast (leave the fat on top)", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, stir together the garlic, salt, pepper and rosemary.
