{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole-Banana Bread", "description": "There are a lot of flavors beyond banana hanging out in this loaf: coconut, chocolate, tahini and almond extract. They get along so well that you end up with something that tastes notably better than almost any other banana bread you\u2019ve had before. It\u2019s cocoa-rich, nutty and not too sweet. Using the whole fruit \u2014 both banana flesh and peel \u2014 punches up the banana flavor, but doesn\u2019t overshadow the other notes. Nadiya Hussain\u2019s recipe offers numerous substitutions; you could play up nutty notes by opting for almond butter and almond milk, or swap in olive oil in place of coconut oil. The recipe inspires infinite permutations.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Charlotte Druckman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/12/dining/10bananarex2/11bananarex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 (8-inch) loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack, dessert", "keywords": "banana, banana bread, cocoa powder, coconut oil, tahini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 809}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/100 grams virgin (unrefined) coconut oil, plus more for greasing the pan (see Tip)", "2 ripe bananas", "2 1/4 cups/280 grams all-purpose flour, plus 1 1/2 teaspoons for tossing peels", "1/4 cup/64 grams tahini (or nut butter of your choice)", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters oat milk, nut milk or dairy milk of your choice", "1 teaspoon almond extract", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/3 cups/200 grams coconut palm or dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup/20 grams unsweetened cocoa powder", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "Unsalted vegan or nonvegan butter (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
