{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian Tamale Pie", "description": "Not to be confused with a Latin American tamale, tamale pie is a comforting retro casserole made from ground beef chili that is topped with cornbread batter and then baked. This vegetarian version relies on vegetables and beans instead of meat. Fresh green chiles and onions are broiled until charred to deepen their flavor, then pur\u00e9ed with tomatoes to make a complex sauce for the beans. The cornbread topping \u2014 crisp at the surface, tender underneath \u2014 gets an optional handful of Cheddar folded into the mix for added verve. Serve this one-pot meal on its own or with a creamy dollop of sour cream or yogurt on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/01/multimedia/27apperex-hmpw/25apperex-hmpw-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "black bean, casseroles, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, poblano, red onion, scallion, sour cream, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 50}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large red or white onion, halved", "2 jalape\u00f1os, halved lengthwise and seeded (if desired)", "1 poblano or green bell pepper, sliced in half lengthwise, seeds removed", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing", "1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more as needed", "1 (28-ounce) can whole plum or diced tomatoes", "3 fat garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "2 tablespoons mild or hot chili powder, more as needed", "2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1 3/4 teaspoons ground cumin", "3 (15-ounce) cans black or pinto beans, drained and rinsed", "1 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems (optional)", "3/4 cup/135 grams fine cornmeal", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/80 grams sour cream or whole-milk yogurt, plus more for serving", "1/4 cup/57 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "2 teaspoons honey", "2 scallions, whites and greens thinly sliced, plus more for serving", "1 cup grated Cheddar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chili: Move a rack as close to the heating element as possible and heat the broiler.
