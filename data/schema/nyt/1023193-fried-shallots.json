This recipe, adapted from \u201cThe Wok: Recipes and Techniques\u201d by J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt (W.W. Norton & Company, 2022), makes sure the shallots are sliced evenly, with a mandoline, for best results. Then, once the shallot rings start to sizzle in earnest, they\u2019re fried gently over medium-high heat. What results is crisp and aromatic, and can be used as a finish for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023191-watermelon-salad-with-fried-shallots-and-fish-sauce\">salads</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023190-spaghetti-aglio-e-olio-e-fried-shallot\">pastas</a> and more.
