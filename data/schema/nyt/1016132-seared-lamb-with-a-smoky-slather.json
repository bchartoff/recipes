{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Lamb With a Smoky Slather", "description": "Leg of lamb on the grill is a quintessential summer dish, but you don\u2019t have to forsake it in colder weather. Simply sear and roast the lamb instead, massaging it with smoky Lapsang souchong tea, funky cumin, garlic and thyme. This recipe calls for a half-leg, which should fit in your skillet.  It\u2019s good, though not necessary, to let the seasoned meat marinate for up to three hours before cooking it. The oven timing is for medium-rare meat, including a temperature rise while the meat rests. But since the meat\u2019s thickness is uneven, some parts may be slightly more well-done. That\u2019s just fine, as there will be a piece for every diner\u2019s taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/19/dining/19PAIR_SPAN/19PAIR-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "lamb, potato, tea, main course, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 557, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "308 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon lapsang souchong tea leaves", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, more to taste", "3 cloves garlic, minced", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, plus thyme sprigs for garnish", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 leg of lamb, boned and butterflied, excess fat trimmed", "1 pound small white turnips, about 8, trimmed and peeled", "1 pound small red potatoes, about 8, peeled", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1 tablespoon soft unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine tea, cumin, salt, pepper, garlic, thyme leaves and olive oil, and mix well.
