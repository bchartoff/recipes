Simmering the carrot in sweet wine until the liquid reduces to the point of becoming a glaze creates a delightful candying effect. The approach works equally well for parsnips and apples, which also have a natural sweetness, and any number of other root vegetables, like sunchokes or salsify.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Charlotte Druckman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/dining/24MARSALA-COVER/merlin_153389190_719ed8e7-1ed1-464a-adc8-d91e9cdb4fbe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, vegetables", "keywords": "apple, marsala, parsnip, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 10}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 191, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "445 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds parsnips", "2 Granny Smith apples", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2/3 cup sweet Marsala", "Chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the parsnips and halve them lengthwise, if very thick.
