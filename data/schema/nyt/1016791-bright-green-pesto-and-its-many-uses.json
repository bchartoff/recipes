{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bright Green Pesto and Its Many Uses", "description": "I\u2019ve been making pesto forever and have never been able to keep it bright green. It has such promise, such flavor, and I know that the pasta or whatever else I use it in will taste wonderful. But I\u2019ve always been frustrated by how quickly the basil oxidizes and the color goes from bright green to drab. So I decided to try blanching the leaves very briefly to see if that would solve the problem and voil\u00e0! It did. You  need to blanch the basil for only  five seconds, and you don\u2019t want to blanch it for more than 10. Doing this  leaches out a wee bit of the basil\u2019s vivid flavor, but not enough to change that of the  pesto significantly. The texture and color are wonderful, and the pesto will keep  for several days in the refrigerator (but it\u2019s best to wait until you\u2019re ready to use the pesto before adding the garlic and cheese).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/09/science/08recipehealth/08recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2/3 cup", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low-carb, low cholesterol, low sugar, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 110}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 175, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "122 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups tightly packed, fresh basil leaves", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons  lightly toasted pine nuts or untoasted chopped walnuts", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, halved, green shoots removed", "1/3 to 1/2 cup  freshly grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium-size saucepan full of water to a boil while you rinse basil leaves.

Add Parmesan  and stir in. The pesto will condense when you add the cheese, so even though you\u2019ve added a half-cup of cheese to the pur\u00e9e, you will end up with about 2/3 cup of pesto.
