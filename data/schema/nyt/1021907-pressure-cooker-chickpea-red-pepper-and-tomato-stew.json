{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Chickpea, Red Pepper and Tomato Stew", "description": "This vegan stew is inspired by romesco, the Spanish sauce made from roasted red peppers, tomatoes, almonds, garlic, olive oil and vinegar. Here, those flavors combine in a ragout that pulls from the pantry, with fast prep and little waste. Instead of stock, this stew relies on the thick liquid from the canned chickpeas, sometimes called aquafaba. And the marinating oil in jarred sundried tomatoes is delicious, especially when augmented with herbs and vinegar. Give yours a little taste to make sure you like it, and then throw that in, too. (If you don\u2019t like it, make up the difference with regular olive oil.) The smoked almonds on top are key, adding necessary crunch and richness, so be generous with them. (If you would like to make this stew on the stovetop, just saut\u00e9 the onion then add the remaining stew ingredients and simmer until the flavors are blended, about 30 minutes.
