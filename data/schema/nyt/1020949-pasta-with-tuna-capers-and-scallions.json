{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Tuna, Capers and Scallions", "description": "There are about a gazillion ways to cook pasta using other pantry staples \u2014 things like garlic, bread crumbs, pecorino, capers, olives and especially, canned fish. This recipe, pasta with tuna, anchovies and capers, showered with lots of green herbs and scallions, is one of my family\u2019s household favorites. I like it with a long, thin, twirlable pasta \u2014 spaghetti, linguine or bucatini \u2014 but you can use whatever pasta you have on hand. Even macaroni works just fine and might even persuade your finicky kid to eat this dish (though, so far, mine abstains).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/23/dining/23pantryrex5/merlin_170847792_732f9bad-0acb-4bee-8f1e-a5dac3ca3df4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "anchovies, capers, garlic, herbs, pasta, scallion, tuna, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 255}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "12 ounces long, thin pasta, such as bucatini, spaghetti or linguine", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "3 scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated", "6 to 10 anchovies, chopped", "3 tablespoons drained capers", "1 cup torn fresh herbs, such as parsley and dill, or celery leaves, plus more for serving (optional)", "1 (5- or 6-ounce) can tuna, drained", "Red-pepper flakes, for serving", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a well-salted pot of boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente.
