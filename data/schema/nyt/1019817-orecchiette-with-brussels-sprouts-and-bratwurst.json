{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orecchiette With Brussels Sprouts and Bratwurst", "description": "This zesty pasta is a playful riff on choucroute garnie, the classic Alsatian dish. The usual suspects (pork and cabbage) show up in the form of bratwurst, brussels sprouts and sauerkraut. Instead of potatoes, pasta joins the party and everything comes together in a tangy sauce of Parmesan, sour cream and fresh dill. Buy sauerkraut that looks fresh and crunchy for best flavor and texture. For a more kid-friendly meal, swap in shell pasta. If you happen to find yourself with leftovers, they make a tasty cold pasta salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/dining/Choucroute-Orecchiette/Choucroute-Orecchiette-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, pastas", "keywords": "bratwurst, dill, orecchiette, parmesan, sauerkraut, sour cream, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 256}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 930, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "103 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1311 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "12 ounces fully cooked bratwurst (about 4 links), sliced 1/2-inch thick (see tip)", "1 cup thinly sliced onion", "12 ounces brussels sprouts, quartered if large or halved if small (about 3 cups)", "8 ounces drained sauerkraut, coarsely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)", "3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "Salt and pepper", "1 pound orecchiette", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan (2 ounces), more for serving", "1/2 cup sour cream (4 ounces)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, parsley or chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
