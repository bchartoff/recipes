{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Chickpea Pasta With Spinach and Rosemary", "description": "Luxurious and hearty, cheap and easy, this vegetarian pasta uses mostly pantry staples, requiring just a few fresh ingredients, like baby spinach, rosemary and heavy cream. Canned chickpeas form the foundation of the dish: They\u2019re cooked until crisp and caramelized. Half are then saved as a garnish, while the rest are simmered until they break down and thicken the sauce. You can swap out your greens or beans, and if you want to experiment with flavor, raid your spice cabinet: Ground coriander, toasted fennel seeds, coarsely crumbled pink peppercorns or a sprinkle of smoked paprika perk up the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/dining/aw-creamy-chickpea-pasta/aw-creamy-chickpea-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, pastas, vegetables", "keywords": "chickpea, heavy cream, rosemary, spaghetti, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2259}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 (14-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained", "2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary, plus more for garnish", "1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper, or 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "Black pepper", "1 large shallot, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 (6-ounce) bag baby spinach", "12 ounces spaghetti or bucatini", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a wide, deep skillet, heat the oil over medium-high.
