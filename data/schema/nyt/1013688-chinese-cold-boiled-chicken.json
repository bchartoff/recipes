{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chinese Cold Boiled Chicken", "description": "This is an easy dish, put together in minutes and abandon for an hour on a low flame. If you do it in the morning, it will be ready for lunch. But it can also be cooked a day ahead. Its flavors deepen with a night in the fridge. The recipe in three sentences: Season the thighs with salt and pepper, ginger, star anise and scallions, cover with water and simmer slowly. Remove the chicken, reduce the cooking liquid, then pour it back over the meat. Wait until it\u2019s well chilled. To serve, sprinkle the ice-cold jelly-clad chicken with sesame oil, scallions, cilantro and jalape\u00f1o slices. Give it a squeeze of lime. If you want something extra, add cucumber, avocado and crisp lettuce leaves. Or take off the skin, shred the chicken and have it with cold noodles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/30/dining/Cold-Boiled-Chicken/Cold-Boiled-Chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 79}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 389, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "415 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large bone-in chicken thighs", "Salt", "pepper", "1 two-inch piece of ginger, peeled and thickly sliced", "4 garlic cloves, sliced", "3 star anise", "4 scallions, 2 whole and 2 slivered", "3 tablespoons chopped cilantro", "1 jalape\u00f1o, thinly sliced, optional", "2 tablespoons roasted sesame oil", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the thighs generously with salt and pepper.
