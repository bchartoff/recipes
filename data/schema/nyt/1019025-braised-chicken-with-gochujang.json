{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Chicken With Gochujang", "description": "Slow-braising to infuse meats with deep flavor and produce warming, stew-like plates of food is a cooking method of choice when the weather brings a chill. This chicken dish is the product of what I call the usual three-step affair (brown chicken, add other ingredients and some liquid, cover and slowly simmer). But I gave it a bit of heat, unpacking sake, ginger, garlic and the spicy Korean condiment gochujang, plus well-mannered slivers of poblano chilis into the pan. You can now find gochujang in supermarkets or online; you won\u2019t use the entire jar for this dish so exploit it for other occasions. It keeps indefinitely in the refrigerator. The chicken will welcome a pillow of steamed rice alongside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/15/dining/15Pairing/15Pairing-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "chicken, cremini, gochujang, sake, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 472}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 682, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1340 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3\u00bd pound chicken, cut in 10 pieces", "1 tablespoon grapeseed oil (optional)", "4 large shallots, sliced thin", "1 tablespoon finely slivered fresh ginger", "2 large cloves garlic, sliced thin", "3 poblano chiles, cored, seeded, cut in thin slivers", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, stems trimmed, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "Salt", "2 tablespoons gochujang", "1/2 cup sake or dry white wine", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "2 tablespoons minced cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken pieces dry.
