{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beans, Bacon and Avocado Concha Sandwich", "description": "Conchas are the most well-known Mexican pan dulce. They are eaten for breakfast with hot chocolate, coffee or milk; as an anytime pick-me-up; as part of dinner or even as dessert. They can also be the base of a satisfying sandwich, creating a welcome clash between savory and sweet. Mexicans seem to be divided on the sandwich topic: Some can\u2019t do without them; some can\u2019t stand them. It is a dish you will not find in a cafeteria or restaurant, but in Mexican homes and lunch boxes. The most well-known versions involve refried beans; this one is filled with chipotle refried beans, bacon and avocado. A sunny-side-up egg can be a good addition.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/21/dining/21conchasrex2/merlin_203820672_5705d803-645f-46df-a30d-59eb45ad601f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "lunch, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "avocado, bacon, refried beans", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 73}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "3 tablespoons finely chopped white onion", "1 1/2 cups cooked or canned black or pinto beans with their liquid", "1 tablespoon sauce from chipotles in adobo, plus 1 tablespoon chopped chipotles (optional), plus more to taste", "Coarse kosher salt (Morton)", "4 <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023045-conchas\">conchas with vanilla topping</a>", "8 thick bacon slices, cooked until crisp", "1 large ripe avocado, halved, pitted, scooped and sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium.
