{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Salsa Verde Chicken", "description": "This warming, satisfying stew takes about 30 minutes from start to finish, thanks to the pressure cooker, which makes quick work of braising chicken and melding flavors. Use your favorite jarred green salsa as a shortcut: The salsa mingles with the chicken juices to make a thick, tangy sauce that tastes like more than the sum of its parts. (Jarred salsas vary in heat levels, so be sure to taste yours first. Make the dish spicier by leaving some of the jalape\u00f1o seeds in.) Serve the chicken over rice or whole grains, which soak up the sauce, or use the chicken in tacos, burritos or enchiladas. You can also add one cup of frozen or fresh corn, or a drained 15-ounce can of black or pinto beans to the cooked chicken and simmer until just warmed through. Pass around toppings like crunchy pepitas, tortilla chips, crumbled queso fresco or avocado, to customize at will.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/25/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-salsa-verde-chicken/sd-pressure-cooker-salsa-verde-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, chili, cilantro, cumin, garlic, jalape\u00f1o, lime, salsa verde, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 296}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1 1/2 cups jarred salsa verde", "1 (4-ounce) can mild chopped green chiles", "8 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 jalape\u00f1o, stemmed, seeded and diced", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "3 scallions (green and white parts), thinly sliced", "1 small bunch cilantro, leaves and tender stems finely chopped (about 1 heaping cup)", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Fresh lime juice, to taste", "Any combination of cooked rice, tortillas, pepitas, queso fresco, diced avocado and crushed tortilla chips, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add\u00a0the chicken, salsa verde, canned chiles, chopped garlic, jalape\u00f1o, garlic powder, onion powder and cumin to a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker; stir to combine.
