You can brush the cold cod fillets with a little melted butter and wrap them in the prosciutto a few hours before you want to cook them. Just let them sit in the fridge, and remember to bring them to room temperature before brushing with a little more butter and cooking. Arrange the lentils on a large dish, place the fish on top and garnish with some freshly chopped parsley if you wish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/30/dining/30COOKING5/30COOKING5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "cod, prosciutto, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 436}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 273, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1440 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 (6-ounce) skinless cod fillets", "2 tablespoons butter, melted", "Salt and black pepper", "8 ounces prosciutto di Parma (about 16 large slices)", "French lentils with garlic and thyme, for serving (optional; <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/8175-french-lentils-with-garlic-and-thyme\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
