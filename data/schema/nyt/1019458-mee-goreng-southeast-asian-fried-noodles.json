{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mee Goreng (Southeast Asian Fried Noodles)", "description": "Mee goreng is a popular fried noodle dish found in hawker centers throughout Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia. If you're seeking a noodle dish that's salty, spicy, tangy and slightly sweet, this version will deliver, and is perfect for impressing guests at a dinner party. The sambal tumis is the true star, adding a kick that marries well with the fresh lime juice and soy sauce. It is traditionally made with yellow wheat noodles, but you can find versions that use dried instant noodles instead. You can also substitute chicken or extra vegetables and tofu for the shrimp.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Natalie Pattillo"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/15/dining/15sambalrex2/merlin_142068330_7cb04901-5cbf-4796-987b-810c33ccc929-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, indonesian, malaysian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, noodles", "keywords": "chiles, sambal, serrano chile, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 41}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 492, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "955 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh yellow egg noodles (such as hokkien mee, yakisoba or lo mein)", "1 1/2 cups sambal tumis (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019421-sambal-tumis\">see recipe</a>)", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails intact", "1 cup cubed fried tofu puffs or firm tofu in 1/2 inch chunks", "3 small bok choy, ends trimmed, chopped", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1 1/2 cups fresh bean sprouts", "2 tomatoes, cut into wedges", "Sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), to taste", "2 limes, cut into wedges (if available, calamansi are best)", "Dried shallots or fried onions, to taste", "Red Serrano or Fresno chiles, thinly sliced, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook noodles according to package instructions."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat prepared sambal tumis in a wok or large skillet for about 5 minutes over medium heat.
