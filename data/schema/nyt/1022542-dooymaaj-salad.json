{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dooymaaj Salad", "description": "Dooymaaj is a nostalgic Iranian childhood snack of dried, days-old bread \u2014 it\u2019s an effort to not waste a single crumb \u2014 combined with fresh herbs, cheese and walnuts. The ingredients are bound with a splash of milk and a drizzle of butter, then rolled into balls and enjoyed as an afternoon treat. This refreshing, zesty, herb-filled bread salad is an homage to the beloved snack. Use any flatbread you like, but crisp lavash bread holds up particularly well against the creamy and tangy buttermilk dressing. This is hearty enough to be served on its own as a light meal or alongside grilled chicken or fish, such as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022310-joojeh-kabab-ba-holu-saffron-chicken-kababs-with-peaches\">chicken</a> or  <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022437-saffron-salmon-kababs\">salmon kababs</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/dining/ND-dooymaaj-salad/merlin_192091863_d8d6ab48-3f93-4be1-a684-8412fa93fbc9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, salads and dressings, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "feta, herbs, lavash, walnut, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 361}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pieces lavash bread (8 1/2 by 11 1/2 inches each)", "3 loosely packed cups fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves (from 1 bunch), coarsely chopped", "2 cups loosely packed mint leaves (from 1 small bunch), coarsely chopped", "1 1/4 cups loosely packed Persian, lemon or other basil, coarsely chopped", "2 scallions, thinly sliced\u00a0", "1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese (2 ounces)\u00a0", "1/2 cup walnut halves, coarsely chopped", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons dried mint", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more if needed", "3/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more if needed", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup buttermilk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the bread for the salad: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 400 degrees.
