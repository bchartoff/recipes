{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Stir-Fried Tofu With Kale and Red Pepper", "description": "Kale is a member of the cruciferous family of vegetables (genus Brassica), so named because their flowers have four petals in the shape of a cross. A nutritional powerhouse that tastes wonderful when properly cooked, kale is one of nature\u2019s best sources of vitamins A, C and K and a very good source of copper, potassium, iron, manganese and phosphorus. These greens are hearty, and they maintain about 50 percent of their volume when you cook them, unlike spinach, which cooks down to a fraction of its volume. The various types of kale also maintain a lot of texture, which makes them perfect for stir-fries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/31/science/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, low cholesterol, vegan, vegetarian, kale, red bell pepper, tofu, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 182}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 259, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "429 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch curly kale (about 10 ounces), stemmed and washed", "1 14-ounce package firm tofu, sliced about 1/4 inch thick", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon Shao Hsing rice wine or dry sherry", "1/4 cup chicken or vegetable stock", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon salt (more to taste)", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper, preferably white pepper", "1/4 teaspoon sugar", "1 tablespoon peanut oil or canola oil", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1 serrano pepper, seeded and minced", "1 red bell pepper, cut in 2-inch julienne", "2 teaspoons dark sesame oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil, add the kale and blanch 1 minute.
