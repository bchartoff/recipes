{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Corn Chowder", "description": "The rich flavor of this lightly creamy chowder comes from slow-simmered corn cobs. After the kernels are removed, the cobs go into the slow cooker along with the potatoes and aromatics, where they infuse the broth as it slow-cooks. The corn kernels are added at the very end, so that they retain their fresh, poppy sweetness. Canned green chiles lend mild heat and tons of mellow, peppery flavor to go along with the sharper jalape\u00f1o. (If you come across fire-roasted canned green chiles, snap those up.) The miso adds a sweet-savory note that reinforces the corn flavor; but if you don\u2019t have it on hand, add about two additional teaspoons of salt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/18/dining/sdg-slow-cooker-corn-chowder/sdg-slow-cooker-corn-chowder-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "bacon, corn, miso, potato, slow cooker, sour cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 619}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ears of corn", "1 pound small creamer potatoes, halved or quartered into 1-inch chunks", "4 cups chicken broth or stock", "2 (4-ounce) cans chopped mild green chiles", "5 scallions, sliced, whites and green parts separated", "5 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 jalape\u00f1o, stemmed, seeded and minced", "1 tablespoon yellow or white miso (optional)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1/2 cup light or heavy cream or half-and-half", "Black pepper, to taste", "Chopped crisp, cooked bacon (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the kernels from the corn cobs and put them in a bowl; refrigerate.
