{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Swiss Chard Rice Bowl With Chorizo", "description": "Jessica Koslow, the owner of Sqirl in Los Angeles, started making rice bowls as way to showcase Kokuho Rose brown rice, a particularly nutty and perfumed heirloom variety grown in Northern California. She has a varied roster of preparations, all of which will work with any good quality brown rice. In this recipe, Swiss chard stems and leaves are seasoned with toasted garlic, cumin and smoked paprika before being mixed into the rice; a crisp chorizo patty adorns the top. If you\u2019d rather leave out the chorizo, you can top this with a fried egg or fried tofu instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/08/dining/08JPAPPETITE2/08JPAPPETITE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "brown rice, chorizo sausage, swiss chard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 203}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 649, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "787 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup medium- or short-grain brown rice", "Kosher salt, as needed", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large bunch Swiss chard, leaves and stems separated", "2 tablespoons cumin seeds", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "2 fresh (uncured) chorizo sausages, casings removed, meat formed into patties", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 to 3 tablespoons cider vinegar, as needed", "3 tablespoons finely chopped chives", "1 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika, more to taste", "Black pepper, as needed", "1/2 cup parsley leaves, as needed", "Fleur de sel, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, combine rice with 2 1/3 cups lightly salted water.
