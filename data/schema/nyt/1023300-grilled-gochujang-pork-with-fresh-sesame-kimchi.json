{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Gochujang Pork With Fresh Sesame Kimchi", "description": "Pork shoulder is often prepared as a large roast, requiring hours of cooking until it\u2019s tender. But if you slice it thinly and pound it, the meat quickly absorbs this savory gochujang marinade and cooks up in no time. The spicy pork is balanced by a cool and crisp sesame kimchi, eaten fresh like a salad rather than fermented like traditional preparations. Baby bok choy stands in for the usual napa cabbage, and it\u2019s coated in a vibrant sauce of garlic, ginger, gochugaru, fish sauce and nutty sesame oil. Tuck any leftover pork and kimchi into sandwiches the next day, garnished with tomatoes and mayonnaise.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/05/dining/kc-griled-gochujang-pork/merlin_206397090_d2c749c4-9ff4-43a3-af2f-0e6c8cfe939a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, meat, main course", "keywords": "baby bok choy, gochujang, pork shoulder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 343}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red chile flakes)", "2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar\u00a0", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "3 teaspoons grated garlic\u00a0", "2 teaspoons grated peeled ginger", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more for seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon fish sauce", "1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 1/2 pounds baby bok choy, quartered lengthwise", "3 scallions, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced on the diagonal", "2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chile paste)", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning", "2 pounds pork shoulder, thinly sliced crosswise and pounded 1/8-inch-thick (see Tip)", "1 large white onion, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rings", "Steamed rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the gochugaru, vinegar, sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of the garlic, 1 teaspoon of the ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, the fish sauce and 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar; mix well.
