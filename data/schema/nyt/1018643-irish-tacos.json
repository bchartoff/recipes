{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Irish Tacos", "description": "You can certainly eat corned beef with boiled cabbage and carrots, but it can be a great deal more exciting to pile the shredded meat \u2014 ruddy pink, salty, fatty and meltingly sweet \u2014 into warm flour tortillas, then top it with a bright, crunchy, slightly fiery cabbage slaw. The contrast between the soft and the crisp, the salt and the sweet, is fantastic \u2014 particularly if you adorn each taco with a few pickled jalape\u00f1os and, perhaps, an additional swipe of mayonnaise. It\u2019s not fusion cooking, nor appropriation. It\u2019s just the fact that everything tastes good on a warm tortilla.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/08/dining/08CORNEDBEEF4/08CORNEDBEEF4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "tacos", "keywords": "cabbage, carrot, corned beef, mayonnaise, tortilla, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 404}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 749, "unsaturatedFatContent": "34 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "2461 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 2 1/2 pounds corned beef (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018642-homemade-corned-beef\">see recipe</a>)", "1 small head of green cabbage, cored and thinly sliced", "3 carrots, peeled and sliced into julienne", "1 cup mayonnaise", "3 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt or sour cream", "3 tablespoons cider vinegar", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper, to taste", "1 1/2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce, or to taste", "12 to 16 flour tortillas, warmed", "Sliced fresh or pickled jalape\u00f1os"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Warm the corned beef in its cooking liquid, or wrap it in foil and set on a sheet pan in a 350-degree oven for 20 minutes or so."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the coleslaw: Mix cabbage and carrots together in a large bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a separate bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, yogurt or sour cream, cider vinegar, salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce to taste."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour half the sauce over the cabbage and carrots and toss to coat thoroughly.
