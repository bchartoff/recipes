{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Cajun Salmon", "description": "This full sheet-pan dinner, ready in 30 minutes, couldn\u2019t be any smarter or easier. Here, salmon, potatoes and asparagus are all added to the same tray at different points for a one-pan meal that makes cleanup seamless. A marinade infused with Cajun seasoning and paprika infuses the salmon, adding smokiness and some color. The bite in the asparagus plays off the flaky tenderness of the salmon, and the baby potatoes round it out. This meal stands on its own, but you could also put the leftovers over lettuce for a lunch salad the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/21/dining/mp-cajun-salmon/mp-cajun-salmon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, cajun seasoning, potato, salmon, sheet-pan, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 790}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (8-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, pin bones removed", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound baby potatoes", "1 pound thick asparagus stalks, trimmed (see Tip)", "2 garlic cloves, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
