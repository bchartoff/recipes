{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate-Cherry Sourdough Bread", "description": "This recipe for sourdough bread comes from Francisco Migoya and Nathan Myhrvold, who wrote \"Modernist Bread\" (The Cooking Lab, 2017). It requires an <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013152-sourdough-starter\">active sourdough starter</a> and plenty of time (about 20 hours) to allow the dough to develop and proof, though very little of that time is hands-on. Rich with tart dried cherries and dark chocolate chips, and gently bitter from the coffee and cocoa powder, the complex, tangy bread is somewhere between sweet and savory, ideal as is or spread with a little salted butter. Since the dough is dark to begin with, use a thermometer to test if it's done, and make sure you allow it to cool completely before slicing it open.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/12/dining/sourdoughcherry/sourdoughcherry-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT21H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breads, project", "keywords": "bread flour, dark chocolate chips, dried cherries, sourdough starter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 161}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 325, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "247 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 heaped teaspoon/8 grams\u00a0instant dry yeast", "3/4 cup/185 grams warm water", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon/230 grams liquid sourdough starter (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013152-sourdough-starter\">see recipe</a>)", "1 2/3 cups/225 grams bread flour, plus extra for dusting", "1/4 cup/30 grams cocoa powder", "1 tablespoon/15 grams espresso or very strongly brewed coffee", "1 1/8 teaspoon/7 grams fine salt", "Canola oil (or other neutral oil), for greasing", "1 cup/160 grams dark chocolate chips", "1 generous cup/160 grams dried cherries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a wide mixing bowl, whisk together the yeast and water and allow the yeast to bloom, about 1 minute.
