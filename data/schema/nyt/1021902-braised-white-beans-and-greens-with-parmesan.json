{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised White Beans and Greens With Parmesan", "description": "Inspired by the Italian dish of saut\u00e9ed puntarelle (an Italian variety of chicory) and white beans, this recipe makes a satisfying vegetarian main course or a hearty side dish for roast chicken or sausages. It opts for canned white beans, for the sake of weeknight convenience, and Swiss chard, which is much milder than puntarelle and easier to find in the U.S. Kale or escarole would also work well, if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got. On that note, grated Pecorino Romano cheese gives the broth a more pungent element, but Parmesan will work in its place. Serve in shallow bowls with toasted country bread to mop up the garlicky broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/14/dining/lh-cheesy-beans-and-greens/merlin_183224118_e83ba06b-3d32-4ca6-a164-7e53b3fbc5fd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, beans, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cannellini beans, dutch oven, escarole, fennel, kale, swiss chard, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 5360}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "1 small fennel bulb, trimmed, cored and small-diced", "1 small yellow onion, small-diced", "2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary or thyme", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste", "1 large or 2 small bunches escarole, kale or Swiss chard, stems removed (10 to 12 ounces)", "2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed", "2 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1/2 cup shredded mozzarella (optional)", "3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan, plus more for serving", "Toasted country bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 12-inch skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium.
