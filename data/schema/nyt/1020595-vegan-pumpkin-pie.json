{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Pumpkin Pie", "description": "The secret to this rich, creamy pumpkin pie is aquafaba, or the liquid leftover from cooked chickpeas, which is used in recipes to mimic the thickening, binding and foaming properties of egg whites. (For ease, we recommend using the liquid from canned chickpeas in this recipe.) This pie could not be simpler: Just toss everything into a blender for three minutes until it increases in volume, pour it into a prepared, unbaked pie crust, then bake until the top is crackly and ever-so-slightly jiggly in the center. Because this pie doesn't contain any eggs or dairy, once the pie is chilled and set, you can let it sit out at room temperature overnight. For longer-term storage, keep it in the refrigerator for up to a week. Serve with a dollop of vegan whipped cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Isa Chandra Moskowitz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/05/dining/icm-vegan-pumpkin-pie/merlin_163633284_a256bde2-aae1-40ff-b996-f5fc517919d1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "aquafaba, cinnamon, cloves, coconut oil, cornstarch, ginger, maple syrup, nutmeg, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 134}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/740 grams pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters maple syrup", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters aquafaba (see Note)", "2 tablespoons coconut oil", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "Pinch of ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 (9-inch) vegan pie crust, unbaked and chilled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
