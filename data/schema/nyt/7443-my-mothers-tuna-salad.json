It\u2019s an unfussy thing that is exactly suited to be layered between two pieces of white bread \u2014 toasted, if you must \u2014 and then eaten at the kitchen table, or, after summer ends, at the lunchroom table. The ingredients are simple and easily acquired, and be sure to use real mayonnaise.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Reed"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "main course, side dish, mayonnaise, tuna", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 252, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "385 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (12-ounce) can StarKist solid white albacore tuna in water", "1/2 cup Hellmann's mayonnaise", "4 large ribs celery, peeled and finely chopped", "3 hard-boiled eggs, chopped", "3 tablespoons chopped sweet pickles, with their juice", "1 tablespoon minced onion", "1 teaspoon celery salt or more to taste", "1 teaspoon McCormick Season-All or more to taste", "6 dashes Tabasco", "Cracked pepper to taste", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain the tuna, place it in a bowl and break it up with a fork.
