(If you like, add a couple of semihot peppers to the mix.) The mozzarella is a nice touch, as is the rosemary, but almost any herb will work beautifully here. Don\u2019t skimp on the olive oil, and don\u2019t underbake the pie; it should be good and brown on the bottom.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/08/magazine/08eat1/08mag-08eat-t_CA2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 pizza", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "bell pepper, flour, mozzarella, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 89}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 teaspoon (2 grams) yeast", "1 7/8 cups lukewarm water", "3 1/2 cups or 500 grams bread flour, plus more for dusting", "3 teaspoons or 8 grams kosher or sea salt", "4 tablespoons or 40 grams extra-virgin olive oil", "5 bell peppers of varying colors", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, torn into small pieces", "1 tablespoon chopped rosemary leaves", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "Pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a comfortably large, preferably rectangular plastic container, dissolve the yeast into 1 3/4 cups of lukewarm water.
