{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thai Curry Risotto With Squash and Green Beans", "description": "A wonderful weeknight dinner option, baked risotto requires minimal effort and can quickly feed a hungry family. Curry paste is the star here, effortlessly lending lots of flavor. Roasted squash brings a hearty sweetness, while the green beans deliver crunch and bite. You can be flexible with the vegetables: Roasted sweet potato, brussels sprouts, broccoli or cauliflower would work equally well, or stir a big handful of spinach or kale through at the final stages before serving. This recipe yields quite a bit, so refrigerate leftovers for up to two days and reheat with more stock. You could also repurpose risotto into rice balls reminiscent of arancini: Simply form into balls, coat in breadcrumbs and shallow fry until crispy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/24/dining/hm-curry-risotto/merlin_183955272_bab289c3-bc10-4c9e-b82f-57a0af5cb0ff-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "arborio rice, butternut squash, coconut milk, curry paste, ginger, green beans, makrut lime leaf, risotto, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2087}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 shallots, finely sliced", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "2 cups arborio rice", "1/2 cup Thai red or green curry paste (4 ounces)", "4 1/2 cups vegetable stock", "1/2 pound green beans, trimmed", "1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk", "4 makrut lime leaves, thinly sliced (optional)", "1 lime, halved", "1/3 cup cilantro, mint, basil or Thai basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position oven racks so that a sheet pan and Dutch oven can fit at the same time and heat oven to 400 degrees.
