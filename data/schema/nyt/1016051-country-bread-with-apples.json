{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Country Bread With Apples", "description": "This is a whole wheat version of a classic Norman country bread. Normandy is apple country and apples find their way into many dishes in this region. I came across the bread in \u201cBread Alone\u201d by Daniel Leader, and have adapted the recipe. The dough ferments overnight in the refrigerator, and after it has come back to room temperature the chopped apples are kneaded in. It goes beautifully with cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/18/science/21recipehealth/21recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "1 large loaf, about 20 slices", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, dairy-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 294, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "177 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["7 grams (2 teaspoons) active dry yeast", "50 grams (1/4 cup) lukewarm water", "365 grams (1 1/2 cups) sparkling cider (such as Martinelli\u2019s), at room temperature", "250 grams (approximately 2 cups) whole wheat flour", "175 grams (approximately 1 1/3 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour", "75 grams (approximately 2/3 cup) rye flour", "13 grams (1 3/4 teaspoons) sea salt", "165 grams finely chopped green apples (such as Granny Smith or Pippin) (approximately 1 1/4 cups; 1 large Granny Smith apple)", "Walnut oil or vegetable oil for the bowl"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a standing mixer, dissolve yeast in the warm water.
