{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Linguine with Crab Meat", "description": "At All\u2019onda in Greenwich Village, the chef Chris Jaeckle channels Venice by way of Japan. This pasta dish, which I enjoyed in his restaurant a few weeks ago, sums it up. Fresh pasta with crab meat and a smidgen of tomato is brightened with yuzu, lemon\u2019s racy Japanese cousin. I remembered the dish as I savored the food-friendly, energetic white Bordeaux. The good acidity and citric notes of these wines welcome seafood. Though Mr. Jaeckle\u2019s version calls for peekytoe crab, it is all but impossible to find in most retail fish markets, so he allowed for regular lump crab meat. As for the yuzu juice, it\u2019s sold in Japanese markets. Look for a refrigerated brand that has no preservatives. You\u2019ll have plenty left over, enough to test your cocktail-making chops before dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/17/dining/17PAIRING/17PAIRING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, pastas", "keywords": "button mushrooms, crab meat, linguine, yuzu juice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 188}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 586, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "57 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "884 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 jalape\u00f1o, cored, seeded, very finely minced", "Zest of 1 lemon", "1 tablespoon yuzu juice (sold in Japanese markets) or lemon juice", "4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, sliced", "4 ounces button mushrooms, sliced", "1/2 cup chopped peeled and seeded tomato, fresh or canned", "Salt", "Japanese togarashi pepper or cayenne, to taste", "2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "1 cup dry white wine", "1 cup seafood stock", "1/2 pound crab meat, preferably peekytoe", "12 ounces fresh linguine", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon chopped tarragon leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine jalape\u00f1o, lemon zest and yuzu juice in a small dish and set aside.
