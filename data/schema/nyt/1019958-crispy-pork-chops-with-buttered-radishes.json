{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Pork Chops With Buttered Radishes", "description": "These crisp, panko-crusted cutlets are your weeknight answer to tonkatsu or Milanese with a simplified, one-step breading procedure, no eggs or flour required. Thin pork chops, either bone-in or boneless, are seasoned with salt and pepper, then simply pressed into panko bread crumbs before crisping up in a hot, oiled skillet. While any quick-cooking vegetable could be tossed in the brown butter and spooned over the chops, radishes are especially nice for the way they keep their bite even after a trip to the skillet. Whatever you do, don\u2019t forget the lemon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/dining/06romanrex1/06romanrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, weekday, weeknight, meat", "keywords": "main course, panko, pork chops, radish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 883}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1015, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "63 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "929 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 bone-in or boneless pork chops (rib or loin), cut 1/2-inch thick (about 6 ounces each)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 cups panko or fresh coarse bread crumbs", "3 tablespoons canola oil, plus more as needed", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons capers", "1 bunch radishes, with tops on if you like, cut into quarters", "Flaky sea salt", "1 lemon, cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season pork with salt and pepper.
