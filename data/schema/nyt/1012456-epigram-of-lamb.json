{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Epigram of Lamb", "description": "This recipe is an adaptation of one that ran in The Times in 1879 and came from a publication called Young Ladies\u2019 Magazine. And although it takes two days to make the actual work involved is brief. The recipe instructs you to serve it with peas, although I\u2019ve seen other versions insisting on asparagus; both are great choices. I made two small changes to the Times recipe. Rather than frying the cutlets in lard (feel free to do so if you like), I used a combination of butter and olive oil. And I included lemon wedges for squeezing over the cutlets at the table, an Italian touch.\n\nAfter making epigram of lamb, Eric Korsh, the chef at Restaurant Eloise in Sebastopol, Calif., called it a \u201cperfect simple recipe.\u201d The braising makes for tender, fragrant cutlets, and there\u2019s something in the saut\u00e9ing that makes the fat in the lamb seem extra succulent. \u201cIt\u2019s like lamb Wiener schnitzel, but beautiful,\u201d Korsh said.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/21/dining/Epigram-of-Lamb/Epigram-of-Lamb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "bread crumbs, lamb breast, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds lamb breast, trimmed of excess fat", "1/2 Spanish onion, chopped", "1 large carrot, peeled and chopped", "2 ribs celery, chopped", "3 cloves", "8 black peppercorns", "3 sprigs parsley", "4 sprigs thyme or sage or rosemary (or all 3)", "Salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 eggs, lightly beaten", "1 to 2 cups coarse dry bread crumbs", "1 tablespoon butter, more if needed", "1 tablespoon olive oil, more if needed", "1 lemon, cut into wedges", "Cooked fresh peas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay the lamb in a large, heavy braising pot.
