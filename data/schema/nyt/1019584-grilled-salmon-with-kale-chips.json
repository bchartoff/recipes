Let it\u00a0shine by\u00a0grilling it on a bed of kale.

You can serve this with potatoes, corn, salad or toasted bread, or any simple side you can throw together quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/dining/sc-salmon-kale/sc-salmon-kale-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "herbs, kale, salmon, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 33}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 244, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "293 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (1/4-pound) piece center-cut salmon", "1 medium bunch kale (curly or lacinato)", "5 tablespoons olive oil\u00a0", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 lemon, zested, half cut into wedges and half juiced", "1 packed cup roughly chopped mixed herbs, such as parsley, mint, dill, basil, cilantro or sorrel", "1 garlic clove, minced or pressed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a grill or grill pan over medium heat.
