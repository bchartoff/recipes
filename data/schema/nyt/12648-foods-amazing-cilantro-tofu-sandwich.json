{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "FOOD\u2019s Amazing Cilantro Tofu Sandwich", "description": "My friend Judy Ornstein has a popular neighborhood cafe on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles called FOOD. I love all of the meals I\u2019ve had there, but my absolute favorite signature dish that they make is a cilantro tofu sandwich. The tofu is dipped in a delicious cilantro-spiked marinade, briefly baked, then topped with a to-die-for roasted corn relish. Alayne Berman, FOOD\u2019s chef, shared the recipe with me. I\u2019ve scaled the recipe down from 10 pounds of tofu to 1 pound, which will make four sandwiches. They are hearty, and I usually make a meal of half a sandwich, but the nutritional information is for a whole one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/31/science/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, sandwiches", "keywords": "cilantro, corn relish, tofu, dairy-free, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 83}, "recipeIngredient": ["A 1-pound block of organic extra-firm tofu (find one that is not too dry)", "3 tablespoons soy sauce, preferably tamari", "1/2 tablespoon minced ginger", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1/2 tablespoon minced shallot", "1/4 teaspoon minced jalape\u00f1o", "1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "1  1/2 tablespoons honey", "2 1/4 teaspoons lime juice", "1/2 teaspoon lime zest", "3 tablespoons canola oil", "1/2 generous bunch cilantro, finely chopped", "1 large ear white corn", "1/4 large red bell pepper, roasted", "1/4 large yellow bell pepper, roasted", "1/4 generous bunch cilantro, finely chopped", "Pinch of cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 4-ounce slice of tofu", "1/4 large or 1/2 small Hass avocado, thinly sliced", "1/2 to 3/4 cup corn relish", "Sliced heirloom or good roma tomatoes, in season only", "2 slices seeded sandwich bread", "2 teaspoons Vegenaise", "Arugula"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
