{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stock-and-Cider-Brined Chicken Over Stuffing", "description": "This one-pan dinner is ugly \u2014 rustic, if we\u2019re being kind \u2014 but good. Or as the Italians say, \u201cbrutta ma buona.\u201d Truly, though, it\u2019s everything you could ask for in a rich, comforting meal. As it cooks, the chicken, brined in stock and cider, drips its flavorful juices onto the bread. The bread absorbs every drop, turning into a chewy, savory nest cradling the tender, perfectly browned chicken. Each bit of stuffing offers a different surprise \u2014 sometimes the sweet-and-sour zing of a prune, other times the faint rumor of Thanksgiving whispered by celery and thyme. It\u2019s as satisfying as you could ever hope, even if it isn\u2019t particularly attractive.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/magazine/13mag-Eat-image1/13mag-Eat-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry", "keywords": "apple cider, chicken stock, chicken thighs, prune, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 489}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 872, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1160 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided", "1 medium yellow onion, diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "3 celery ribs, diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon fine sea salt, divided", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 1-pound loaf crusty country bread", "1 1/2 cups sodium-free chicken stock, preferably homemade or purchased from a butcher", "1 1/2 cups apple cider", "1 cup quartered pitted prunes", "2 tablespoons apple-cider vinegar", "2 1/2 pounds (6 to 8 large) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "2 tablespoons finely chopped sage", "2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley", "1 tablespoon finely chopped thyme", "Optional: 1 1/2 cups cooked, chopped leafy greens like kale, chard or broccoli rabe"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the brine: Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet or similar pan over medium-low heat.
