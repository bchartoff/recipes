{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach and Blueberry Cobbler With Hazelnut Biscuits", "description": "Cobbler is an irresistible summer treat, with its combination of bubbling fruit and golden biscuits. This version uses sweet, nutty hazelnut flour in the biscuits, which bake up crunchy on the outside and tender in the middle. To swap whole hazelnuts for the meal, start with 1/2 cup (64 grams) hazelnuts, toasted and with skins rubbed off. Grind the cooled nuts in a food processor or coffee grinder with the 1/3 cup (65 grams) granulated sugar until finely ground, and proceed with recipe as written. Tart wild blueberries are best here; use fresh if you can find them, but frozen are widely available and can go straight into the mix, no thawing necessary. Conventional supermarket blueberries work, too, but shouldn\u2019t be the first choice; they are watery and have a weaker flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/24/dining/24PEACHES-WEB4/24PEACHES-WEB4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "blueberries, hazelnut flour, heavy cream, peach, vanilla bean, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 135}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 391, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "278 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/56 grams hazelnut meal", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into pieces", "1/3 cup/75 milliliters cold heavy cream, plus more for brushing top", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters cold whole milk", "Sanding sugar, for sprinkling", "2 to 4 tablespoons sugar (depending on how sweet the fruit is)", "1/2 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped (or 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract)", "2 pounds/910 grams ripe peaches (3 to 4 medium peaches), pitted and cut into eighths (no need to peel it)", "2 cups/320 grams blueberries, preferably wild, either fresh or frozen (no need to thaw)", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "Pinch of kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
