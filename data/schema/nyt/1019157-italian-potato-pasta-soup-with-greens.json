{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Italian Potato-Pasta Soup With Greens", "description": "Some soups are light and refreshing preludes to a meal; others, like this one, are an entire meal in a bowl. Pasta and potatoes, like pasta and beans, are frequently combined in Italian vegetable dishes. The potatoes should be starchy, like Yukon Golds or russets, so that they lend body to the broth. Short pasta shapes add texture; onion, fennel, garlic, tomato paste and fresh herbs and greens add flavor. The soup may be made a day or so before serving: It improves in the refrigerator and reheats beautifully, but don\u2019t add the pasta in this case until serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/31/dining/31kitchen2/merlin_132835553_cce17a28-4d61-4870-a8ad-2899c4b4b9cc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, soups and stews, vegetables", "keywords": "kale, pasta, potato, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 873}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 373, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1404 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for garnish", "2 cups diced onion", "1 cup diced carrot", "1 cup diced fennel or celery", "Salt and pepper", "1 bay leaf", "1 large thyme sprig", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 teaspoons paprika", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "3 quarts/12 cups chicken broth, vegetable broth or water", "2 pounds medium-size starchy potatoes, such as Yukon Golds or russets, peeled and cut in 1-inch chunks", "8 ounces kale or chard, stems removed, leaves sliced across into 1/2-inch ribbons (about 4 cups total)", "1/2 pound dried pennette, orecchiette or other small pasta", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary or marjoram, for garnish", "Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, heavy soup pot or Dutch oven, heat the 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat.
