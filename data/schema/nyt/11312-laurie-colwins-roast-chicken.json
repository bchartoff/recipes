Not many people will take the time to stuff and truss a chicken, and Ms. Colwin famously abandoned the practice when she found her child making spider webs with her expensive trussing string.

A little time, simply spent, rewards with tender meat and a savory stuffing, an easy feast for a night at home.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pilar Viladas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/19/dining/colwin-still/colwin-still-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 74}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3- to 3 1/2-pound chicken", "3 to 4 cups cubed whole-wheat bread", "1/2 cup porcini mushrooms", "1/4 to 1/3 cup broth", "Salt and fresh ground pepper", "Paprika", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 tablespoon melted butter or water or broth for basting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
