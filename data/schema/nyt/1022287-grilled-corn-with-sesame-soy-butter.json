{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Corn With Sesame-Soy Butter", "description": "Mark Twain advocated for boiling corn \u2014 preferably right in the corn field. But there\u2019s no better way to cook corn than by grilling. The high dry heat of the fire caramelizes the natural plant sugars, intensifying the corn\u2019s natural sweetness while adding a beguiling smoky flavor. The key is to brown the kernels on all sides. To form a convenient handle for eating the corn, fold the husk back below the stem end. In this version, the corn is seasoned with sesame, soy, mirin and butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/16/dining/15vegetablesrex-corn/merlin_188793684_fcb012c6-b345-4c9f-b195-4886807b3ed8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "black sesame seeds, corn, mirin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 77}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon mirin or honey", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Vegetable oil, for the grill grates", "4 ears corn in husks", "2 tablespoons black sesame seeds or toasted white sesame seeds", "1 tablespoon minced fresh chives or scallion greens"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sesame soy butter: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat.
