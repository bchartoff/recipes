{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Midnight Fizz", "description": "While a classic gin fizz uses lemon juice, the sweet acidity of lime in this variation skews it toward a (very) frothy gimlet. To ensure plenty of that froth, use a double shake to make the cocktail: first without ice to foam the egg white, then a second time with ice to chill and dilute the drink. Serve traditionally without ice in a small Collins or fizz glass, or go rogue and serve over a few cubes. Either way, as with all egg white drinks, drink with efficiency to capitalize on the drink\u2019s froth and avoid its inevitable separation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/29/dining/23cocktailsrex2-fizz/merlin_199407117_6e47634b-cf03-41dc-9cde-f1b9026b6706-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "gin, lime, orange liqueur, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 244}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces dry gin", "3/4 ounce fresh lime juice", "1/2 ounce <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014441-simple-syrup\">simple syrup</a>", "1/2 ounce orange liqueur, such as Pierre Ferrand Dry Cura\u00e7ao, Cointreau or triple sec", "1 egg white", "Ice", "Soda water, chilled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a shaker, combine the gin, lime juice, simple syrup, orange liqueur and egg white.
