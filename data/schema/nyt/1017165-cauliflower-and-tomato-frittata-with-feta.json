{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cauliflower and Tomato Frittata With Feta", "description": "Cauliflower, tomatoes and feta are always a good combination. This being a winter frittata, I used canned tomatoes for the sauce, but in summer the same dish can be made with fresh tomatoes. Make sure to cook the sauce down until it is quite pasty. If it is too watery it will dilute the eggs and the texture of the frittata will be a bit watery. Even better, make the tomato sauce a day ahead and keep uncovered in the refrigerator.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/31/science/recipehealthfrittata/recipehealthfrittata-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 288}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 155, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "370 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste), minced", "1 14.5-ounce can chopped tomatoes, with juice", "Pinch of sugar", "Salt to taste", "1 sprig basil or 1/2 to 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "1/2 medium head cauliflower, cored and cut or broken into small florets (about 3 cups florets)", "2 ounces feta, crumbled (about 1/2 cup)", "1/4 cup imported black olives, pitted and halved or coarsely chopped (optional)", "8 large or extra-large eggs", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 to 2 tablespoons chopped flat leaf parsley or a combination of parsley and mint or marjoram"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat in a heavy 10-inch skillet,\npreferably nonstick.
