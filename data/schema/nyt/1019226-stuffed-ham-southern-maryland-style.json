{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffed Ham, Southern Maryland Style", "description": "There are as many recipes for southern Maryland stuffed ham as there are families in St. Mary\u2019s County. It shows up on Christmas and Easter tables, and at almost every community fund-raising supper. This recipe, compiled from cooks whose families have been making it for generations, uses raw stuffing and is spiced with plenty of black and red pepper. Because the ham boils for so long, the spiciness will mellow. The most challenging part is the finding the ham itself. Corned hams \u2014 which are simply fresh hams that have been cured in salt or brine \u2014 aren\u2019t usually in the grocery meat case, and butchers will often require advance orders. Corning your own fresh ham is not hard, but it can take several days and turns this into even more of a project.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/21/dining/21Hamrex/merlin_135440628_f69500db-be20-48fd-9565-3ce6201fd209-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings, plus leftovers", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, meat, project", "keywords": "cabbage, ham, kale, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 893, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "79 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "4752 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 of a fresh or corned ham (8 to 12 pounds)", "1 cup kosher salt plus more, if corning", "3 pounds green cabbage", "1 pound curly kale, or a mixture of other greens like mustard greens or watercress", "2 medium yellow onions (about 1 pound)", "1 bunch scallions (about 7)", "1 1/2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper", "1 1/2 tablespoons red-pepper flakes", "1 tablespoon mustard seed", "1 tablespoon celery seed", "1 teaspoon cayenne", "1 tablespoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If corning the ham: Cut slits about 3 inches deep in a few places around the bone. Push salt into the incisions and, with a light hand, rub salt all over the surface of the ham. Reserve any remaining salt to rub into the ham as it corns, adding more if needed later in the process.

Unwrap and turn it every couple of days, sprinkling with more reserved salt and pouring off any juice that collects each time. Rewrap.

Begin by chopping the cabbage. A food processor with a shredding blade is helpful. Place the cabbage in a large pan or bowl. Remove large stems from the kale and other greens, if you are using them, and chop. (Tip: Freeze cleaned, whole kale leaves overnight in plastic bags, then break up the frozen leaves while still in the bag and add to the stuffing mixture.) Chop the yellow onions and scallions, and add them to the cabbage and kale."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix the vegetables well and add the spices. Mix again. (Your hands will work best for this, but wear gloves if your skin is sensitive to pepper.) Taste the stuffing and adjust, adding more cayenne or red-pepper flakes for a more intense spiciness.

Pack the slits tightly with stuffing, and add stuffing to the center of the ham where the bone was.
