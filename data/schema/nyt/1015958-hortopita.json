{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hortopita", "description": "This terrific recipe for a massive pile of mixed greens, herbs, leek and winter squash, all encased in homemade phyllo dough, came to The Times from the noted Greek-born food writer and cooking instructor Diane Kochilas, with whom Mark Bittman cooked in her Athens apartment. It\u2019s a bit of work, to be sure, but Kochilas has codified the process so that it\u2019s straightforward, and the results are both delicious and impressive. It's important to note that the phyllo dough created here need not be the extremely thin version we see in pastries, but rather a reasonably thin and easily worked dough rich in olive oil. It seems daunting. It is not.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/15/multimedia/bittman-athens/bittman-athens-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "1 pie, 8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "leek, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 28}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 303, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "682 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds pumpkin or butternut squash, peeled, seeded and shredded", "Coarse sea salt", "1 bunch Swiss chard (preferably green stemmed)", "1/2 pound flat-leaf spinach", "1 bunch sweet sorrel", "1 bunch Mediterranean hartwort, about 1 1/2 cups, chopped", "1 bunch chervil, about 1 1/2 cups chopped", "1 1/2 cups snipped fresh dill", "3 bunches wild fennel, leaves only, about 2 1/2 cups chopped", "1 small bunch parsley, chopped", "1 small bunch fresh oregano, chopped", "1 small bunch mint leaves, chopped", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 leek, tough greens trimmed and discarded, whites rinsed well and chopped", "2 red onions, finely chopped", "1 recipe for <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015957-basic-phyllo-dough\">homemade phyllo</a>, at room temperature and divided into four equal-size balls", "Flour for rolling out the pastry"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the pumpkin in a colander, salt lightly and toss.
