Okra often gets a bad rap, but in this recipe, searing it in ghee preserves its structure, adds texture and seals any potential stickiness. Onion, tomato, red chile powder, ginger and garlic come together to make this a zinger of a dish. Finishing with lime juice adds fresh tartness that balances the heat. If you can\u2019t find fresh okra, frozen works just as well.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zainab Shah"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/zs-bhindi-masala/merlin_203495754_7e841d55-7fbc-47f2-8804-a6de8f908592-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course, side dish", "keywords": "ghee, ginger, lime, okra, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 254}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons ghee or neutral oil", "1 pound okra, fresh or frozen (no need to thaw), stemmed and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces (see Tip)", "1/2 teaspoon grated ginger or ginger paste\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon grated garlic or garlic paste\u00a0", "1 large red onion, quartered and thinly sliced", "3/4 teaspoon kashmiri or other red chile powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric\u00a0", "1 medium plum tomato, finely chopped", "1\u00bc teaspoons fine sea salt\u00a0", "2 to 3 tablespoons lime juice\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon garam masala\u00a0", "Roti or pita (optional), for serving\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium (9-inch) frying pan or wok, heat 2 tablespoons ghee over medium-high for 30 to 45 seconds or until it has melted.
