{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hawaiian Guava Cake", "description": "Now considered a classic Hawaiian dessert, guava cake was created at Dee Lite Bakery in Honolulu, where it became widely popular. This version is adapted from blogger Alana Kysar\u2019s \u201cAloha Kitchen: Recipes From Hawai\u2018i,\u201d a cookbook of traditional Hawaiian dishes. Outside of Hawaii and California, pink guava concentrate can be tough to find, but you can also use white guava concentrate or 100 percent guava juice. (If using juice, you\u2019ll need to reduce it; see Tip below.) To mimic that lovely pink color, add a few drops of red food coloring. If you don\u2019t, the cake will still taste like guava, but will look more like a vanilla cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kiera Wright-Ruiz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/08/dining/kw-guava-cake/kw-guava-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13 cake (about 24 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "butter, cream cheese, guava, red food coloring, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 269}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 248, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "160 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/320 grams cake flour", "2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "6 large egg whites", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters neutral oil, like canola or vegetable oil", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "1 cup/240 milliliters guava concentrate or reduced guava juice (see Tip)", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "4 drops of red food coloring (optional)", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy whipping cream", "8 ounces/230 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "Pinch of kosher salt", "3 drops of red food coloring (optional)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters guava concentrate or reduced guava juice (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
