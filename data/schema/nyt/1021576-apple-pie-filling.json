{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Pie Filling", "description": "Many apple pies call for simply tossing cut apples with sugar, adding a thickening agent and some spices, and plopping it all into a crust. But precooking the apples has multiple advantages: First, it draws out some of their juices, to ensure consistency. (No undercooked apples or runny filling here!) And, second, it prevents the filling from sinking away from the crust as it cools, leaving a pocket of air between filling and crust. Use this all-purpose filling in a traditional pie, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021578\">tiny hand-held pies</a>, or in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021577-apple-cobbler\">a cobbler</a>. It\u00a0can be made several days ahead, leaving just assembling and baking.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/dining/apple-pie-filling/apple-pie-filling-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 cups (enough for 1 9-inch pie)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "apple, apple pie, butter, cinnamon, make-ahead, vanilla, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 305}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "6 to 8 medium apples, such as Honeycrisp, Granny Smith or Gala, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 6 1/2 cups/1 kilogram)", "2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 cup/220 grams light or dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/45 grams all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, melt butter over medium heat.
