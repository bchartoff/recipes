The floral and fruity Cocchi Americano, an aperitif wine, balances out the bitter bite of the Aveze, but not too much. Once you get used to the herb garden of flavors, the drink serves admirably as a palate cleanser and appetite whetter, all in an appealingly low-alcohol package. After two or three, you may even think it delicious. (I thought so after only one.) Think of it as a distant, sunny cousin of the Negroni.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/12/dining/12OUTLIER2/12OUTLIER2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "Aveze, Cocchi Americano, dry vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 23}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces Aveze (gentian liqueur)", "3/4 ounce Cocchi Americano", "3/4 ounce dry vermouth, preferably Dolin", "Sprig of thyme"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing glass three-quarters filled with ice, combine the Aveze, Cocchi Americano and vermouth.
