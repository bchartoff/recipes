{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Watermelon and Pancetta Risotto", "description": "The important thing for this dish is to have good, sweet, ripe watermelon that is firm enough to retain its shape once cubed, as well as good-quality pancetta, cut thick enough so that you can cube it to match the shape of the melon. Don\u2019t use prepackaged pancetta or have it sliced into paper-thin wisps. Also important is to use good chicken stock. The best, obviously, is to make it yourself. But if that\u2019s not available, good, organic, low-sodium stock will work, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Asimov"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/28/dining/watermelon/watermelon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 main-course portions", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "arborio rice, pancetta, watermelon, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1154, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "117 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "57 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "1796 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups chicken stock", "10 to 12 ounces pancetta, cubed", "6 tablespoons butter", "1/2 medium-sized onion, diced", "16 ounces arborio rice", "3/4 cup dry white wine", "Salt and pepper", "1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano", "3 cups cubed watermelon or to taste", "1/2 cup chopped mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, bring the stock to a boil, then switch off heat.
