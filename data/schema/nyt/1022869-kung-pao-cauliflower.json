{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kung Pao Cauliflower", "description": "While kung pao chicken originated in China\u2019s Sichuan Province, it has become an iconic Chinese American dish. The popular stir-fry typically includes chicken, vegetables and peanuts tossed in a dark, salty, sweet and spicy sauce, but in this vegan take, cauliflower steps in for the chicken. Dark soy sauce is more caramel-flavored and less salty than regular soy sauce, and it adds color and richness to the dish. If you don\u2019t have dark soy, substitute with regular soy sauce or hoisin sauce. Make sure you have a lid for your skillet or wok on hand before you start cooking, as covering the cauliflower allows it to cook quicker and more evenly.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/12/dining/hm-kung-pao-cauliflower/hm-kung-pao-cauliflower-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "cauliflower, chinese american, dried chiles, peanut, sichuan peppercorns, soy sauce, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1421}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon dark soy sauce", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon black vinegar", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/4 cup vegetable stock or water", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1 head cauliflower (about 2 pounds), cut into small 2-inch-long florets", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 green or red bell pepper, core, seeds and membrane removed, and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, lightly ground in a mortar and pestle, spice grinder or crushed with a rolling pin", "5 to 8 whole dried chiles, such as er jing tiao or chiles de arbol", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece of ginger, peeled and finely sliced", "1/3 cup roasted peanuts", "2 scallions, white and green parts, finely sliced", "Steamed rice, to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk together the dark soy sauce, soy sauce, black vinegar, sugar, vegetable stock or water, and cornstarch.
