Pour through a strainer into the prepared mold or dish; set in a hot-water bath and bake in the lower third of the oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until custard is set and a knife comes out clean; cooking times vary with the depth of the mold. Set aside to cool completely before refrigerating; the flan should be served chilled. To unmold, carefully insert a blunt, thin metal spatula around the rim of the custard and gently tip the mold from side to side to see if it is loose. If the caramel on the bottom of the pan has hardened, place in a pan of hot water to loosen and test again. Unmold into a serving dish."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/4036-flan-de-cafe-coffee-caramel-custard"}
