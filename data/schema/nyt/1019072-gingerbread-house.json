But feel free to leave them out. We strongly recommend using a scale here. It will make it much easier to accurately measure the ingredients and to evenly divide the dough. This recipe, for the house's building blocks, is large, and it makes enough for the project featured in our <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/47-how-to-make-a-gingerbread-house\">How to Make a Gingerbread House guide</a>. But as the instructions state, you'll want to make it in two batches, since it's too big for the average stand mixer. Note that you'll want to bake your gingerbread at least a few days before assembling the house, to give the slabs time to harden, and set aside a few hours for decoration and assembly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/06/dining/06GINGERBREADnew3/06GINGERBREADnew3-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Gingerbread for 1 9-by-9-inch house", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, project", "keywords": "cinnamon, ginger, molasses, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 72}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/454 grams unsalted butter (4 sticks), at cool room temperature", "2 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons/595 grams dark brown sugar", "12 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/1,648 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting\u00a0", "2 heaping tablespoons/15 grams ground ginger", "2 heaping tablespoons/15 grams ground cinnamon", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "4 eggs, at room temperature", "2 cups molasses", "Zest of 2 lemons (optional)", "Zest of 2 oranges (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make half of the batch: In a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together half the butter and half the sugar for 5 minutes, until fluffy.
