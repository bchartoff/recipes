{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arancini", "description": "There\u2019s no way around it: To make arancini, you have to make risotto, although you could also use any kind of leftover risotto, as long as the mixture isn\u2019t loose from excess liquid. This recipe employs a simple base of Parmesan risotto that is chilled, rolled, breaded and fried, but the classic version starts with saffron risotto, which explains the Italian name arancine, or little oranges, named for their shape and hue. Simmering risotto and frying the arancini are simple tasks, but the step in between is crucial: Do not skimp on chilling your risotto. If it is not properly chilled, it will fall apart in the hot oil instead of forming crisp, glistening, orbs filled with molten cheese. Serve these arancini with warmed tomato sauce or even pesto, and crown them with a flurry of gremolata or plain lemon zest for brightness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/dining/aw-arancini/aw-arancini-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, finger foods, grains and rice, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "arborio rice, italian seasoning, mozzarella, tomato sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 561}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1/2 medium white or yellow onion, minced (about 3/4 cup)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "3/4 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning or dried parsley", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup arborio rice (about 7 ounces)", "1/3 cup white wine or white vermouth", "2 cups chicken stock, warmed", "1 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves, plus more for garnish", "4 ounces whole-milk or part-skim mozzarella, cut into 24 (1/2-inch) cubes", "1/3 cup all-purpose flour", "2 eggs", "1 cup panko or bread crumbs", "2 teaspoons Italian seasoning or dried parsley (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 quarts canola or vegetable oil", "1 cup arrabiata sauce or other tomato sauce (fresh or store-bought), warmed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the risotto: In a medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium.
