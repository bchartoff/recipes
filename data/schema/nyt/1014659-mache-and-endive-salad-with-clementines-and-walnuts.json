{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mache and Endive Salad With Clementines and Walnuts", "description": "Mache, a delicate green with a mild, subtle flavor, packs quite a nutritional punch, as it is high in omega-3s (as are walnuts) and folic acid. The salad is simple to throw together, but its flavors are complex, with sweet juicy mandarin (or tangerine or clementine sections), crunchy bitter endive and walnuts, soft and almost sweet mache, and vibrant fresh herbs. The recipe will serve 4 to 6 but I admit to eating a good half of this salad when I tested it.<br/><br/>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/09/science/10recipehealth/10recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6\n\n", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "clementines, m\u00e2che, walnut, dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low-sodium, raw, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 31}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 157, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "211 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 4-ounce bag mache", "2 endives, thinly sliced crosswise", "1/4 cup walnuts (1 ounce), lightly toasted if desired", "2 seedless, juicy mandarins, clementines, or seedless tangerines, peeled and broken into sections", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon or mint, or a combination", "1 tablespoon sherry or champagne vinegar", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed orange juice", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, to taste", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon walnut oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the mache, endive, walnuts, mandarins or clementines, and fresh herbs in a large bowl.
