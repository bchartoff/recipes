{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet-and-Salty Party Mix", "description": "This joyful, crunchy snack to share with friends (and enjoy with cocktails) relies on corn syrup, sugar and soy sauce for a balance of sweet and savory. The glaze in this recipe is a riff on the sweet-and-salty coating used in cereal-seaweed snack mixes found in Hawaii that bakes into an irresistible, super-crisp shell. A bit of Worcestershire sauce lend some tang, and cayenne adds a surprising touch of heat. Use the mix-in amounts as a guide, and feel free to use whatever cereals, crackers and nuts speak to you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/06/dining/sse-party-mix/merlin_189647466_ff38c169-6197-4498-96df-51598ac46d69-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 16 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods", "keywords": "butter, corn syrup, peanut, popcorn", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 331}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for greasing the pans", "1/2 cup/113 grams salted butter (1 stick)", "1/3 cup/105 grams light corn syrup", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "4 cups/100 grams crunchy, salty snacks, such as cheese crackers, rice crackers, bagel chips, sesame sticks or a combination", "3 cups/115 grams salted mini pretzels", "6 cups/180 grams rice or corn Chex or Crispix cereal, or a combination", "3 cups/29 grams store-bought or homemade salted popcorn", "1 cup/125 grams roasted, salted cashews (or your favorite nut)", "1/4 cup/35 grams hemp or sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 250 degrees.
