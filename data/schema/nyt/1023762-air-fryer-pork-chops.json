{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Air-Fryer Pork Chops", "description": "This easy air-fryer recipe creates tasty, effortless pork chops, with the flexibility to season ahead of time or with no notice at all. The sugar-and-spice blend performs double duty, injecting a jolt of seasoning all over while also caramelizing as the pork cooks, forming a delightfully crackly crust that keeps the meat moist. Depending on the size of your air-fryer basket, you may be able to fit more than two pork chops, but the temperature and cook time will stay the same.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eleanore Park"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/21/multimedia/ep-air-fryer-pork-chop-1-151f/ep-air-fryer-pork-chop-1-151f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, quick, weeknight, meat, main course", "keywords": "air fryer, pork chop", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 167}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (3/4-inch-thick) boneless pork loin chops (about 6 ounces each)", "Salt", "1 teaspoon brown sugar\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat air fryer to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat pork chops dry with paper towels.
