It is pure peanut sophistication; two crunchy, crisp peanut butter cookies filled with pillowy peanut-butter frosting. These cookies spread a fair amount while baking, so be sure to give them plenty of room on the baking sheet and let them cool and firm up before filling. \n\n(After reading through some of the reader comments, we retested the original recipe and decided to make the cookies smaller and double the filling. We've edited the below recipe to reflect those changes.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Frank Bruni"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/16/dining/16COOKING-BOUCHON-BUTTERS1/16COOKING-BOUCHON-BUTTERS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 50 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, peanut, peanut butter, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 254}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 259, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "209 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2\u00a0cups/256 grams\u00a0all-purpose flour", "2\u00a0teaspoons\u00a0baking powder", "4\u00a0teaspoons\u00a0baking soda", "1\u00a0pound/454 grams (4 sticks)\u00a0salted butter, at room temperature", "2/3\u00a0cup/180 grams creamy\u00a0peanut butter, preferably Skippy", "1\u00a0cup/201 grams granulated\u00a0sugar", "1\u00a0cup/200 grams firmly packed light\u00a0brown sugar", "2\u00a0large\u00a0eggs", "1 1/2\u00a0teaspoons\u00a0vanilla extract", "1/3\u00a0cup/47 grams coarsely chopped\u00a0peanuts", "2 1/2\u00a0cups/223 grams quick-cooking\u00a0oats", "1/2 pound/227 grams (2 sticks)\u00a0salted butter, at room temperature", "1\u00a0cup/270 grams creamy\u00a0peanut butter, preferably Skippy", "3 1/3 cups/410 grams\u00a0confectioners' sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
