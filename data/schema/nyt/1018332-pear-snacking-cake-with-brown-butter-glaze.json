{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pear Snacking Cake With Brown Butter Glaze", "description": "This moist and tender cake has a similar texture to pumpkin or banana bread, with a delicate pear flavor scented with nutmeg and a touch of clove. But the real star is the brown butter glaze, which is nutty and rich, tasting a little like butterscotch, with a strong vanilla sweetness. The cake keeps well when stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, though the glaze will lose its snap from the chill. Or, bake the cake ahead, then glaze it a few hours before serving for the best texture. You can freeze the unglazed cake as well, up to a month ahead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/29/multimedia/clark-pear-cake/clark-pear-cake-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "butter, pear, rolled oats, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 299}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 535, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "341 milligrams", "sugarContent": "45 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/227 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature, more to grease the pan", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/100 grams dark brown sugar", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1/8 teaspoon ground clove", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "4 large pears (2 1/4 pounds/1 kilogram), peeled, cored and shredded or finely chopped (to yield 2 1/2 cups)", "2 3/4 cups/350 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/75 grams rolled oats", "1/2 cup toasted walnuts or pecans, chopped (optional)", "5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons/25 grams dark brown sugar", "1 cup/125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3 tablespoons/45 milliliters heavy cream or milk, more as needed", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
