But adding a little salt for flavor and olive oil for richness yields an airy, tender matzo that\u2019s easy to make. This version also includes a small amount of whole-wheat flour for earthiness, but you can use all white flour if you prefer. Matzos will keep for at least a week stored airtight at room temperature. (Note that these matzos are not kosher for Passover.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/dining/01Apperex/merlin_171067596_b279d2de-450e-4281-a3e9-b2b392c2f96a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 matzo crackers", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "breads, crackers and chips", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, olive oil, whole wheat flour, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 67}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1/4 cup/30 grams whole-wheat flour", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil", "Flaky sea salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "With the racks positioned the top third and middle, heat oven to 500 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon to stir together all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour and kosher salt.
