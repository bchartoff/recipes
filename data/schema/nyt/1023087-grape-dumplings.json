{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grape Dumplings", "description": "Grape dumplings are a favorite treat among southeastern Indigenous nations. Originally made with strained muscadine or possum grapes, they\u2019ve been adapted by modern cooks using other dark grape varieties and bottled Concord grape juice. In a blend of old and new, this take on the popular indigenous recipe pays homage to the historic use of cornmeal while observing popular contemporary practices of adding flour and sweetener. The dumplings incorporate blue cornmeal and whole-wheat flour to intensify the rich evening shades of the dish, and the sauce substitutes agave for granulated sugar. Pair them with vanilla ice cream and a sprig of fresh tarragon for a delightful explosion of perfectly purple goodness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kevin Noble Maillard"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/dining/18graperex/merlin_205030737_9296bc1b-034e-4517-8d5d-8f48a578236a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dumplings, dessert", "keywords": "blue cornmeal, cornmeal, grape", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 245}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/75 grams blue cornmeal (or medium-grind yellow)", "1/2 cup/70 grams whole-wheat flour, plus more for kneading", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 cup Concord grape juice (see Tip)", "1 egg", "2 teaspoons melted butter", "2 teaspoons agave (optional)", "4 cups Concord grape juice (see Tip), plus more if needed", "1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch", "2 cups/10 ounces dark, seedless grapes, plus more for serving", "2 teaspoons agave (optional)", "Vanilla ice cream and fresh tarragon leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare dry dumpling ingredients: Sift all dry ingredients into a medium bowl.
