This recipe comes from Chintan Pandya, the executive chef at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/dining/adda-indian-canteen-review.html\">Adda Indian Canteen</a>, a New York restaurant that specializes in homestyle Indian food. You\u2019ll need to purchase deggi mirch, an Indian chile powder that tastes somewhat like a smoky paprika, but is mild enough to be used in a quantity large enough to color the meat red. The spiced meat mixture benefits from chilling to help retain its shape on the grill, but you could also roll it into meatballs and pan-sear them on the stovetop or roast them in the oven, if the season dictates.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/aw-lamb-kebabs/aw-lamb-kebabs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 kebabs", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, barbecues, finger foods, meat, skewers and kebabs", "keywords": "amul cheese, anardana, cardamom, garam masala, ground lamb, mint, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 44}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 pounds ground lamb", "1 packed cup shredded Amul cheese or white Cheddar (about 3 ounces)", "1/3 packed cup very finely chopped fresh cilantro", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons deggi chile powder, plus additional for garnish", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon minced green Thai chile or serrano chile (with seeds)", "2 teaspoons garam masala", "1 teaspoon black cumin seeds (shah zeera) or regular cumin seeds", "3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "Kosher salt", "Neutral oil, for greasing", "3 packed cups roughly chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems", "2 packed cups roughly chopped fresh mint leaves", "1/4 cup finely chopped red onion", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon minced green Thai or serrano chile (seeds included)", "2 tablespoons anardana (dried pomegranate seeds), crushed, or very finely chopped fresh mango", "2 teaspoons lemon juice", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more as needed", "Red onion, very thinly sliced, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the lamb skewers: In a large bowl, combine the lamb with the cheese, cilantro, chile powder, ginger, garlic, green chile, garam masala, cumin seeds, cardamom and 2 teaspoons salt.
