{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thai-Style Spare Ribs", "description": "These ribs are often served in Thailand to accompany ice-cold beer, said Andy Ricker, the chef and owner of the Pok Pok restaurants in New York and Portland, Ore. He warns against overcooking them: Thai diners prefer ribs on the chewy side rather than falling-off-the-bone tender. They may be cooked over indirect heat in a covered charcoal grill, but it is far easier to bake them in a slow oven, then reheat (on the grill, if you wish) at the last minute. The ribs are quite flavorful on their own, but serve them with a spicy dipping sauce if you prefer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/dining/16kitchenrex/16Kitchen-recs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "baby back ribs, ginger, honey, soy sauce, tamarind paste, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 304}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 104, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "382 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 racks of baby back ribs, 3 to 4 pounds, halved lengthwise to make 3-inch ribs (ask your butcher to do this)", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3 tablespoons honey", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon tamarind paste or hoisin sauce", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons grated ginger", "1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon", "Pinch of grated nutmeg", "Pinch of cayenne", "2 tablespoons Shaoxing cooking wine, mirin or sherry", "3 tablespoons chopped garlic chives or scallions, for garnish", "3 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay the ribs flat in a roasting pan.
