{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tandoori-Style Chicken", "description": "Cooking chicken the night before to serve cold or at room temperature the next day is a brilliant plan for summer soir\u00e9es, picnics or potlucks. Since the flavors of something cold are usually less pronounced than when they were warm, and since flavors are always muted during storage anyway, the key is to start with more flavor: a blast of herbs, a rub or a marinade. A fiery jalape\u00f1o and ginger spiked yogurt marinade to give life to my take on tandoori chicken, for example. The lack of any messy sauces means that they can all be packed up and taken on a picnic without worrying about dripping, leaking containers. A resealable plastic bag or sheet of aluminum foil will work just fine. You could even happily eat everything with your fingers \u2014 if, say, you eschewed (or forgot) the plastic forks and knives and just packed a stack of paper napkins.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/18/dining/18COOKING-TANDOORISTYLECHICKEN1/18COOKING-TANDOORISTYLECHICKEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "chicken, cilantro leaves, yogurt, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 408}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1262, "unsaturatedFatContent": "57 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "88 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "106 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "892 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plain yogurt", "1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1 small onion, peeled and cut into chunks", "1 jalape\u00f1o, stemmed, and seeded if desired", "1 inch-long piece gingerroot, peeled and sliced into coins", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "4 pounds skinless chicken drumsticks and thighs, rinsed and patted dry", "Vegetable oil, for brushing", "Lime wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For marinade, combine all ingredients except for chicken, oil and lime wedges in a food processor and pur\u00e9e until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "With a sharp knife, make several incisions on each chicken piece to help marinade penetrate meat.
