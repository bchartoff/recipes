{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Fig Tart", "description": "The photogenic tart will make you look like a pastry chef, though it's no more difficult than baking a pie. A sweet tart crust is layered with almond cream, fig jam (homemade is nice, but store-bought works well, too) and fresh figs. The key to success is superb figs. They can\u2019t be so jammy that they collapse when you cut them into quarters or sixths. But they should be sweet and ripe. The dough recipe below makes two crusts, one for now and one for later (store extra dough, well-wrapped, in the freezer).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/dining/31martha1/31martha1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch tart", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "almond four, cake flour, dark rum, fig jam, figs, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 240}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces/168 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), preferably French style with 82 percent fat, at room temperature, plus more for the pan", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/112 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "Rounded 1/3 cup/39 grams almond flour, sifted", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 extra-large egg, beaten", "2 2/3 cups/315 grams all-purpose flour or cake flour, sifted", "2/3 cup/70 grams almond flour", "3/4 cup/70 grams confectioners' sugar", "3/4 teaspoon cornstarch", "1 teaspoon cake flour or all-purpose flour", "5 tablespoons/2 1/2 ounces/70 grams unsalted butter, preferably French style, at room temperature", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "1 extra-large egg, beaten", "1 tablespoon dark rum", "1/2 cup/150 grams fig jam, either <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018270-fig-jam\">homemade</a> or store-bought", "18 ounces/500 grams fresh figs", "Powdered sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: In a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sea salt on medium speed for about 1 minute.
