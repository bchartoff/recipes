{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach and Sardine Sandwich", "description": "Whenever I fly, I like to go armed with lunch, as the food in airports tends to be both appalling and expensive. Lately I\u2019ve hitting the road with sandwiches that combine produce with canned fish, like sardines, herring, trout or smoked salmon \u2014 all of them high in omega-3 fatty acids, packed with protein and delicious. In some of this week\u2019s sandwiches, I used small whole-wheat English muffins that were lightly toasted. The muffins won\u2019t fall apart, even with a juicy filling like Greek salad, and I like the size. This is inspired by the classic Mediterranean combination of sardines and spinach. I like to use lightly smoked sardines in olive oil for it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/spinachsardines/spinachsardines-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "One serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, quick, weekday, sandwiches", "keywords": "healthy, main course, sardines, spinach, whole-wheat english muffins", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 115}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 small garlic clove, minced", "2 ounces baby spinach 2 cups tightly packed, rinsed", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "1 small (3 1/2-inch) whole-wheat English muffin, lightly toasted", "Dijon mustard (optional)", "2 canned sardines, preferably lightly smoked in olive oil about 2 ounces, filleted", "1 small tomato, sliced optional", "Lemon juice", "About 1 teaspoon mayonnaise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, and add the garlic.
