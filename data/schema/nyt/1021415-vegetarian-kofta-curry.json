{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian Kofta Curry", "description": "Kofta curry \u2014 a saucy dish of gently spiced meatballs \u2014 is often made with meat. But this one, based on my grandfather\u2019s, swaps in a mash of beans. Bound with bread crumbs and seasoned with ginger, garlic, green chile and herbs, it\u2019s a variation full of flavor and texture. Have it with some flatbread and some sliced cucumber in yogurt, or spooned over a bowl of rice. It\u2019s also delicious in a sandwich the next day. Note: To make it with lamb, as in his original version, substitute 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb for the beans. Soak the bread crumbs in 1/2 cup whole milk first, then squeeze out any extra liquid before adding them to the mixing bowl.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/13/magazine/13mag-eat/13mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "black beans, cilantro, ginger, mint, spring onions, tomato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1715}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 garlic cloves", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled", "2 green chiles (such as jalape\u00f1o or serrano), stems removed", "1 (14-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained", "4 spring onions or scallions, trimmed and chopped", "1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, 1 tablespoon reserved for garnish", "1 bunch fresh mint, chopped, 1 tablespoon reserved for garnish", "1/2 cup bread crumbs", "1 egg", "1 teaspoon garam masala, plus more for garnish", "1/2 teaspoon red chile powder", "1 teaspoon sea salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed", "1 medium white onion, finely chopped", "8 to 10 ripe Roma tomatoes (about 3 pounds) or 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the garlic, ginger and green chiles in a food processor, and pulse until you have a coarse paste.
