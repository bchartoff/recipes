{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Fried Collard Greens", "description": "Collard greens are a mainstay of Liberian cuisine, brought to the country from the United States by formerly enslaved Africans. Here is a classic Liberian preparation that\u2019s spicy with habaneros (Liberia is known for being the \u201cPepper Coast\u201d of Africa), and rich with the flavors of ham, turkey and chicken. Each meat brings a distinct taste, creating the base for a gravy that you\u2019ll want to spoon over rice. This is one of those vegetable dishes that\u2019s hearty enough to be a main, whether it\u2019s for Thanksgiving \u2014 which is celebrated in Liberia with foods like this one \u2014 or any other gathering.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/10/dining/08liberian-thanksgiving-rex2/08liberian-thanksgiving-rex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "collard greens, ham hock, smoked turkey, kwanzaa, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 135}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds collard greens, stems removed", "1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 pound smoked Cajun or regular turkey, preferably neck or wings, cut up", "1 pound ham hock, sliced (see Tip)", "2 large yellow onions, coarsely chopped", "1 to 2 habanero peppers, stemmed and halved", "6 cups unsalted chicken broth, store-bought or homemade", "1 tablespoon chicken seasoning base, such as Knorr or Better Than Bouillon", "1 tablespoon seasoned salt", "1 chicken-flavored bouillon seasoning cube, such as Maggi (optional)", "4 ounces dried barracuda or other fish (optional), rinsed, skin removed and broken into chunks", "1/2 cup olive oil", "Cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash collard greens in a bowl full of water with vinegar and salt.
