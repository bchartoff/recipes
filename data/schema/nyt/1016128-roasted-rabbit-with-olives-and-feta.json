{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Rabbit With Olives and Feta", "description": "Rabbit is mild and just a little earthy tasting, with silky meat that stays moist if you take care not to overcook it. Here it\u2019s quickly roasted with olives, lemon and feta cheese, which melts into a creamy pan sauce to spoon on top. Try to find French feta, which is softer and mellower than its assertive Greek and Bulgarian cousins. While the recipe calls for white wine, you can also make this dish with a light-bodied red. Serve it with crusty bread for scooping up the good, savory sauce.<br /><br />And if you must, yes, you can substitute chicken for the rabbit. Just increase the roasting time, before you add the feta, by 10 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/13/multimedia/clark-roasted-rabbit/clark-roasted-rabbit-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "feta, lemon, rabbit, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 732, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "74 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1166 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3-pound rabbit, cut into 8 pieces (your butcher can do this)", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano ", "6 garlic cloves, crushed and peeled", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 cup white wine, not too dry, such as riesling", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "5 thin slices lemon, seeded", "1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives, halved", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces ", "4 ounces feta cheese, preferably French, crumbled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place rabbit pieces in a large bowl and toss with rosemary, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper.
