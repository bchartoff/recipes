Cook, stirring, about one minute and add the wine and clam juice. Cook over moderately high heat about two minutes or until the liquid is reduced to about one and a third cups. Add the clams and pepper strips. Cover closely and cook three to five minutes. As each clam opens up, remove it. If the cooking liquid has evaporated excessively, add a bit of water. Swirl in the remaining butter. Put the clams in a shallow serving dish and pour the sauce over all. Sprinkle with the remaining scallions."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2778-casserole-of-clams-and-chinese-sausages"}
