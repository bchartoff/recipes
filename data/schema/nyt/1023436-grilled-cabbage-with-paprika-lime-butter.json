To make that a reality and ensure it isn\u2019t dry, tough or bland, soak the cabbage wedges in water and salt while the grill heats. The wet brine will soften and season every bit of the hardy vegetable (like in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023416-kimchi\">kimchi</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013368-sauerkraut?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=12\">sauerkraut</a>). Once the cabbage is drained and over the grill\u2019s flame, the water trapped in the crevices will steam the inner leaves, while the cabbage\u2019s surfaces will crisp and brown. A smoky-citrusy butter melts into the wedges, adding richness and luxury, but a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019393-buttermilk-blue-cheese-dressing?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=13\">creamy dressing</a> or a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022368-nuoc-cham?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=1\">bright sauce</a> would be great, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/07/dining/as-grilled-cabbage/merlin_212088348_b6ba4665-3392-414c-821d-a543db3e187e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "lime zest, savoy cabbage, smoked paprika, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 80}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium green, red or Savoy cabbage (about 2 pounds)", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened", "1 teaspoon finely grated lime zest (from 1 lime)", "1 small garlic clove, finely grated", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "Hot sauce or red-pepper flakes, to taste", "Olive oil, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the grill to medium-high."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove any wilted leaves from the cabbage, then cut through the root into 2-inch-thick wedges.
