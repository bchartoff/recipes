Most include the common Louisiana trinity of vegetables: green peppers, celery and onion. Some include meat, often a spicy sausage like andouille, in addition to or in place of shellfish. And while some gumbos rely on okra as a thickener, others use a roux, a combination of flour and fat cooked until brown and tasty.\n\nWhat I like about this gumbo is that it borrows a little from many approaches to create a lighter, more contemporary dish: a one-pot meal that\u2019s ideal for any occasion calling for a crowd-pleaser.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/27/dining/scallop-gumbo/scallop-gumbo-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun, creole", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, one pot", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, scallops, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 301}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 189, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "425 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "2 tablespoons butter", "1/3 cup flour", "1 onion, chopped", "1 green bell pepper, chopped", "2 celery stalks, chopped", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "Salt", "black pepper", "2 to 3 cups vegetable or chicken stock, or water", "2 cups chopped tomatoes with their juice (canned are fine)", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried", "1 tablespoon fresh oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried", "2 bay leaves", "Cayenne to taste", "1 pound scallops", "Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put oil and butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-low heat.
