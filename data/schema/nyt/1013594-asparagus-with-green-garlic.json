{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Asparagus With Green Garlic", "description": "When you saut\u00e9 or roast asparagus in hot olive oil, the asparagus will have a much more concentrated flavor than it would if steamed or blanched. Here I add the garlic to the pan once the asparagus is just about done, so that the garlic cooks only long enough to soften and sweeten. You can serve this skillet dish with grains or pasta, or with eggs -- fried, poached or scrambled. I find this asparagus so hard to resist that I decided to give you a range for the weight. One pound is adequate, but you might want to treat yourself to more than that.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/10/science/10recipehealth/10recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "asparagus, green garlic, gluten-free, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 53}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 90, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "349 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small bulb green garlic that has formed cloves", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 to 1 1/2 pounds asparagus, trimmed and cut on the diagonal into 2-inch lengths", "Salt", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Separate the garlic bulb into cloves, remove the thick skins from each clove, and cut the garlic into thin slices."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy skillet.
