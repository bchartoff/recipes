{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sous-Chef Salad", "description": "Following the model of a classic French salade compos\u00e9e, this satisfying salad, packed with cooked and raw vegetables, as well as canned best-quality tuna and hard-boiled eggs, presents beautifully and eats like a meal. It builds upon a traditional salade ni\u00e7oise, but a true ni\u00e7oise uses no lettuce, often has anchovies, would want cracked black ni\u00e7oise olives and would not have artichoke hearts and basil. So let\u2019s call this a sous-chef salad \u2014 and dodge the whole argument while picking up another: It is definitely the best meal salad you will eat all summer. Take care to arrange it so there\u2019s some of each component wherever your eye lands. Try to nestle and fluff the ingredients to allow them all to be seen, rather than piling layer atop layer and thus obscuring the beauty of everything below. This makes the salad very attractive and, most important, ensures that everyone gets some of everything in each bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/25/magazine/25mag-eat/25mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, lunch, main course", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, butter lettuce, canned tuna, egg, green beans, kalamata olives, marble potatoes, radish, red leaf lettuce, salad, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 800}, "recipeIngredient": ["Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "5 ounces marble potatoes", "6 ounces green beans, stems removed, tails intact", "4 large eggs (refrigerator cold)", "1 small head soft lettuce, such as butter or red-leaf lettuce", "1 bunch radishes", "4 ounces artichoke hearts in brine", "3 to 4 ounces ripe cherry tomatoes (red, yellow or mixed)", "1 (6.7-ounce) jar high-quality tuna packed in oil", "1/2 small red onion (about 2 ounces), halved and thinly sliced", "1 ounce pitted Kalamata olives, halved (about 1/4 cup)", "3 garlic cloves,\u00a0freshly peeled\u00a0", "1 to 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "Extra-virgin olive oil (about 1/4 cup)", "2 large, leafy basil sprigs (2 to 3 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat.
