At the end, while the sausages and rolls spend a few minutes over direct heat to brown and crisp, the cooked vegetables rest in a tart vinaigrette to balance the sweetness of the peppers. Tuck the sausages and vegetables into the roll, then add mustard, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12291-giardiniera\">giardiniera</a>, mozzarella or nothing at all.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/15/dining/AS-Grilled-Sausages-Peppers-and-Onions/AS-Grilled-Sausages-Peppers-and-Onions--articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "onion, pepper, sausage", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 202}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 sweet or hot Italian pork sausages (about 1 pound)", "1 pound bell peppers (any color), seeds and stem removed, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rings", "2 large yellow or red onions, peeled and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rings (about 1 1/2 pounds total)", "Olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 hero, hoagie or sub rolls, about 6 inches long, halved lengthwise but still connected", "1/4 cup red wine, Sherry or apple cider vinegar", "Pinch of dried oregano (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for two-zone cooking over medium-high heat.
