{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Sheet-Pan Chicken With Sweet Potatoes and Kale", "description": "These sheet-pan chicken thighs gain gorgeous color from a harissa-yogurt marinade, which also keeps the meat juicy during the roasting process. The thighs only need 15 minutes in the marinade, but you can leave them for up to 24 hours in the fridge. For weeknights, heat the oven, place the chicken in the marinade, then wash and cut the sweet potato and kale, so the prep work is done and the oven hot by the time the chicken is done marinating. Make the herb oil while the chicken roasts so it has time to sit. While it\u2019s meant for the vegetables, it\u2019s also wonderful drizzled on top of the chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/14/dining/yf-roasted-chicken-thighs-with-sweet-potatoes/merlin_180213600_6cd3d79b-f1df-4423-a857-d2279f37343c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "chicken, harissa, kale, sweet potato, yogurt, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 896}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon harissa", "1/4 cup full-fat Greek or Skyr yogurt", "4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 medium sweet potato, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 2 cups)", "1 bunch lacinato or curly kale, stemmed and cut or torn into 1-inch ribbons", "1 small red onion, peeled and cut into 1-inch wedges", "3 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup olive oil", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley or cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped", "1 lime, zested and juiced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large shallow mixing bowl, combine the harissa and yogurt.
