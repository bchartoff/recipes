It's portable, it's endlessly versatile, and it's practically foolproof. Substitute almost any cheese for the Parmesan (or leave it out altogether) and toss in any cooked vegetable or meat. Make it your own. \n\nOne last bit of advice from Mr. Bittman:\n\n\u201cThe key to extreme enjoyment is to make sure that some ends of pasta pieces protrude from the top of the mixture when you put it in the oven. They will become crunchy, giving the leftover pasta yet one more pleasant dimension.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/23/dining/pasta-frittata/pasta-frittata-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 894}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 286, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "322 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 pound spaghetti, linguine, fettuccine or other long pasta (or about 1/2 pound cooked pasta)", "Salt and pepper to taste", "4 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup minced pancetta, bacon or prosciutto, optional", "6 eggs", "1 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using leftover cooked pasta, chop it up.
