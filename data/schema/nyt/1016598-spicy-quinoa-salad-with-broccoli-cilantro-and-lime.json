{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Quinoa Salad With Broccoli, Cilantro and Lime", "description": "The grassy flavor of quinoa works well with cilantro in this main-dish salad.\nI love the versatility of quinoa. It can be the building-block ingredient for a salad, as it is in this main-dish salad, or it can be added to salads in smaller amounts, almost as a garnish. Its grassy flavor marries well with cilantro, itself an herb with a grassy, though more pungent, taste. I added sieved hard-boiled eggs for protein \u2013 though you could leave them out if you want to make a vegan version of this dish, and toasted pumpkin seeds for crunch. \nAnother ingredient that contributes crunch as well as color is the soaked split red lentils. They also contribute more protein to an already high-protein grain. They are optional \u2013  make this salad whether or not you have the lentils.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/24/science/23recipehealth/23recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 400}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 485, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "607 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups cooked quinoa", "1 1/2 cups steamed broccoli florets (about 1/3 of a crown), steamed for 4 to 5 minutes then separated into smaller florets", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "1 to 2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds (to taste)", "1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons minced serrano or jalape\u00f1o chili (to taste)", "1/4 cup split red lentils, soaked for 2 hours or longer and drained (optional)", "1 ounce crumbled feta cheese (1/4 cup)", "Freshly ground pepper", "3 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "Salt to taste", "1 garlic clove, minced or pureed", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 hard-boiled eggs", "1 avocado, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine quinoa, broccoli, cilantro, pumpkin seeds, minced green chile, red lentils if using, feta and freshly ground pepper.
