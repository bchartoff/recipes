You could season store-bought mayonnaise for this recipe from Priscilla Martel, but at least just once, you should make your own. It\u2019ll be delicious, and you\u2019ll feel like a magician. The dish is beautiful served plain, and tasty dressed with anchovies, capers, snipped chives or other herbs (choose one or more).
