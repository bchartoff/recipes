This tangy recipe, enhanced by the lingering heat of habanero chiles, uses goat, but you can substitute lamb, beef or pork cuts of a similar size. Any large bone-in cut of meat will do, and will be coaxed into tenderness after a slow braise. The best way to serve this is right in the pot or on a large platter for guests to share, garnished with a mess of fresh herbs and citrus zest and served alongside steamed rice, jollof rice,\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020283-dodo-fried-plantains-with-quick-pickled-onions\">fried plantains</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020286\">crispy yam fries</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/24Nigerianrex4/merlin_156696663_fe8c024d-6871-46b0-b732-333ee978a62e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef stock, canned tomatoes, carrot, goat leg, thyme, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 64}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons canola\u00a0oil, plus more as needed", "1 (4- to 5-pound) bone-in goat leg, cut in half or thirds to fit your pot (or use similarly sized\u00a0lamb, beef or pork cuts)", "Kosher salt", "1 garlic\u00a0bulb, halved crosswise", "3 large carrots, scrubbed, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces", "2 large red onions, peeled and chopped into large dice", "1 (14-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes with their juices", "10 fresh thyme sprigs", "2 fresh bay leaves", "1 red habanero chile, stemmed", "4 cups beef or chicken stock", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes with their juices", "2 medium red bell peppers, stemmed, seeded and roughly chopped", "1 medium red onion, peeled and roughly chopped", "8 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "2 red habanero chiles, stemmed", "1/4 cup canola or other neutral oil", "1 lemon, zest removed in strips, then julienned lengthwise", "1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves and tender stems", "1/4 cup torn fresh mint leaves", "1/4 cup sliced scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons canola oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, ovenproof pot over medium-high.
