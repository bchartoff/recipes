{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoked Salmon Tart for a Crowd", "description": "This is an easy but elegant cocktail snack to serve year round, but it\u2019s especially nice during the holiday season as a reward for bearing up with frigid winter weather. Essentially, it\u2019s a large buttery cracker, garnished with smoked salmon and cut up like a pizza. The pastry rounds may be baked ahead and left at room temperature. Assembling one tart at a time is the best way to keep everything looking and tasting freshly made. The recipe makes four 8-inch tarts; if you need less, consider making a half batch or freezing some of the dough for future use.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/10/dining/10KITCHEN1/10KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 tarts, each serving 2 to 4 people", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, smoked salmon, trout roe", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 351}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 693, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "675 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/310 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "Kosher salt", "4 ounces/1 stick/120 grams unsalted butter, cold and cut in half-inch chunks", "2 egg yolks, beaten with enough ice water to make 1/2 cup", "8 ounces/1 cup/240 milliliters cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "3 tablespoons freshly grated horseradish, or more to taste", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "Zest of 1 lemon", "Coarsely ground black pepper", "1 small sweet onion, very thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon olive oil", "1/4 pound/4 ounces/125 grams sliced smoked salmon", "2 ounces/60 grams trout roe or wild salmon caviar (optional)", "1 tablespoon snipped chives", "1 teaspoon roughly chopped tarragon, or torn leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pastry: Put flour, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a food processor.
