To achieve this contrast in textures, the eggs are cooked in a thin layer of rippling-hot oil. While this recipe is written for four eggs, it will work with any number. (Adjust the pan size and oil accordingly). Avoid touching the eggs until the bottoms and edges are lacy and crisp. Once that happens, spoon some of the oil onto the whites until cooked through. The yolk remains untouched, ready to be sopped up by toast or potatoes, or with yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/07/dining/AS-olive-oil-fried-egg/merlin_195254193_650a29e7-3d2c-4b62-9735-a9a1999d8fff-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 eggs", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, main course", "keywords": "egg, egg dish, olive oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 593}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 eggs", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium (10-inch) cast-iron or nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high until it ripples like the ocean.
