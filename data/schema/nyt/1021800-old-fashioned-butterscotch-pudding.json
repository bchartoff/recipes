{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Old-Fashioned Butterscotch Pudding", "description": "This creamy pudding, thickened with cornstarch and egg yolks and stirred together on the stove, is as homey as it gets. Spiking the mixture with a little bourbon or Scotch isn\u2019t strictly traditional, but it does add a pop of flavor. Choose bourbon to underscore the caramelized notes of the brown sugar, or Scotch for a savory smokiness and a nod to the name. Here\u2019s a tip: Make sure to bring the pudding to a full, vigorous boil to activate the cornstarch. Otherwise, it may not set. If you\u2019ve ever ended up with thin, runny pudding, undercooking may have been the issue.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/20/dining/15Apperex/merlin_182183349_dffca039-0a09-427b-986c-122d8b4bef5a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "brown sugar, cream, egg yolks, milk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1450}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large egg yolks", "3 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3/4 packed cup/165 grams dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 cups/480 milliliters whole milk", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 tablespoon bourbon or Scotch whisky (optional)", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "Whipped cream, sour cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving", "Chopped candied ginger, sliced almonds, Demerara sugar, shaved chocolate, cocoa nibs or flaky sea salt (or a combination), for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put egg yolks, cornstarch and salt into a large heatproof bowl, and whisk until the mixture is smooth and there are no lumps."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot over medium heat, combine brown sugar and butter, whisking, until the brown sugar melts, 1 to 2 minutes.
