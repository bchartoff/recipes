It is a perfect dinner-party meal: chicken thighs or legs dusted in flour and roasted with shallots, lemons and garlic in a bath of vermouth and under a shower of herbes de Provence. They go crisp in the heat above the fat, while the shallots and garlic melt into sweetness below. You could serve with rice, but I prefer a green salad and a lot of baguette to mop up the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/03/dining/COOKING-CHICKEN-PROVENCAL/COOKING-CHICKEN-PROVENCAL-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 7382}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 580, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "689 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 chicken legs or 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 to 3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 tablespoons herbes de Provence", "1 lemon, quartered", "8 to 10 cloves garlic, peeled", "4 to 6 medium-size shallots, peeled and halved", "1/3 cup dry vermouth", "4 sprigs of thyme, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
