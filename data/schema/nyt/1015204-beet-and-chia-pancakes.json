I finally got around to it. I used two-thirds whole wheat flour and one-third all-purpose flour in this very pink batter. Ms. Boyce uses a mixture of quinoa flour and all-purpose, which shows off the bright color of the beets to a better effect. I think millet flour would be a good choice too. It\u2019s important to pur\u00e9e the roasted beets until they\u2019re really smooth; I found using a powerful hand blender was more effective for this than my food processor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/08/science/10recipehealth/10recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 15 pancakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, lunch", "keywords": "beet, chia seeds, halal, healthy, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 80}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 101, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "203 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large or 2 medium beets (enough for 1/2 cup pur\u00e9ed roasted beets) ", "125 grams (1 cup) whole wheat flour or teff flour (or a combination)", "60 grams (1/2 cup) unbleached all-purpose flour", "10 grams (2 teaspoons) baking powder", "5 grams (1 teaspoon) baking soda", "2 grams (rounded 1/4 teaspoon) salt", "1 tablespoon sugar, honey, or agave syrup (optional)", "2 eggs", "5 grams (1 teaspoon) vanilla", "1 1/2 cups buttermilk or 1 cup yogurt + 1/2 cup milk", "35 grams (3 tablespoons) chia seeds", "3 tablespoons sunflower, grapeseed or canola oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
