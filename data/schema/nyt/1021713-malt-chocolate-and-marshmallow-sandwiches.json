They are sophisticated cookies, but the flavors are inspired by a favorite childhood treat: malted milk balls. The secret ingredient is malted chocolate drink powder such as in Ovaltine, Milo or Bournvita powder. The gold leaf or flaky sea salt topping is optional, but don\u2019t hold back if you\u2019re ready to dive into something that looks as exquisite as it tastes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/08/dining/yk-malt-sandwich-cookies/merlin_180932466_22f6aec2-4c33-498d-9b35-57d9cb6d1bd1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "16 to 18 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "christmas, valentine\u2019s day, dark chocolate, gelatin, honey, malted-milk powder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 636}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough", "1/2 cup/45 grams malted chocolate powder, such as Ovaltine", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 \u00bd sticks), at room temperature", "1/2 cup/110 grams dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon honey", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream", "4 ounces/115 grams 70 percent dark chocolate, chopped, or baking squares or pistoles", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/150 milliliters heavy whipping cream", "Edible gold leaf, luster dust or flaky sea salt (optional)", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters honey", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons powdered gelatin"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cookies: In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, malted chocolate powder and baking powder."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the butter, brown sugar, honey and salt.
