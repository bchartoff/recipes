{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bulgogi (Korean Grilled Beef)", "description": "Bulgogi, a Korean classic of marinated grilled beef, is easy to make and fun to eat; it\u2019s no wonder it is one of the country\u2019s most successful culinary exports. As with most Korean barbecue, the meat is seasoned with sesame and scallion, and has ripe pears in the marinade to tenderize the meat and add a characteristic sweetness. Round, pale yellow Asian pears are traditional, but Bosc pears are just fine.\n\nThe meat is only half the recipe: Just as important are the crunchy vegetables, pungent herbs and savory sauces that all get wrapped together into delicious mouthfuls. Perilla is a common Korean herb in the mint family, but if you cannot find it, you can try other herbs like shiso or cilantro. Make sure to wrap your bundle tightly: According to Korean tradition, you must finish it in a single bite!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/03/dining/maangchi-moskinSUB/maangchi-moskinSUB-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, barbecues", "keywords": "Asian pear, roasted sesame oil, sirloin, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 418}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound well-marbled, boneless sirloin, tenderloin or skirt steak", "4 large garlic cloves", "1 cup peeled, chopped ripe Asian or Bosc pear", "3/4 cup finely chopped onion", "1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger", "1 scallion, chopped", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon roasted sesame oil", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar or honey", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted", "Whole, fluffy lettuce leaves for wrapping, such as green leaf, oak leaf or romaine; and whole perilla leaves (optional)", "Any or all of the following: hot cooked short-grain rice; long green hot peppers, sliced crosswise into 1-inch chunks; small peeled garlic cloves; carrot and cucumber spears or sticks, 1 to 2 inches long", "Korean Barbecue Sauce (Ssamjang, <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017445-spicy-sweet-korean-barbecue-sauce-ssamjang\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wrap beef in plastic wrap or butcher paper and place in freezer for 1 to 2 hours to firm up."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut beef across the grain into thin slices.
