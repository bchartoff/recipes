{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Tomato Soup With Basil and Farro", "description": "You overbought fresh tomatoes at the farmers' market and now you're left with a pile of overly-soft, rapidly-ripening fruit. What to do? Make a hearty, vegetable-based soup with those mushy tomatoes pur\u00e9ed into satiny sweetness.

It adds an earthy flavor, and body, to make a tomato soup with bona fide stick-to-your ribs inclinations.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/19/dining/19APPE1/19APPE1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 small servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, fall, farro, leek, tomato, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 225}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "725 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1 1/2 cups farro", "3 large sprigs basil, stems and leaves separated", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "4 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 large leek, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "3 1/4 pounds ripe tomatoes, cored and cut into wedges", "Black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour 8 cups cold water and 1 1/2 tablespoons salt into a pot and bring to a boil over high heat.
