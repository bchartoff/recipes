{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Porchetta Pork Roast", "description": "This rich, crackling-coated pork roast has all the intense garlic, lemon and herb flavors of a classic Italian porchetta, but is much simpler to make (case in point: you don\u2019t need to de-bone a whole pig). The only potentially tricky part is scoring the skin. If you are buying the meat from your butcher you can have them do it for you. Or, use your sharpest knife or a razor blade. It\u2019s worth the effort for the amber-colored cracklings it produces. The recipe feeds a crowd, so make it for a large gathering. Or plan on leftovers, which make excellent sandwiches for lunch the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/09/multimedia/clark-porchetta/clark-porchetta-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT12H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "main course, pork shoulder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1938}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 505, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "777 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (7- to 8-pound) bone-in, skin-on pork shoulder roast, or a 6- to 7-pound boneless roast, fat trimmed to 1/4-inch thickness", "1/4 cup chopped fennel fronds", "1/4 cup chopped fresh rosemary", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage leaves", "5 garlic cloves, grated or mashed to a paste", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon fennel seed", "3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Score skin and fat all over pork, taking care not to cut down to the meat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor or mortar and pestle, combine fennel fronds, rosemary, sage, garlic, lemon zest, salt, fennel seed, red pepper flakes and black pepper.
