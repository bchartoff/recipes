Masarepa blanca is a precooked corn flour and can be found in Latin markets as well as some larger grocery stores or ordered online. (Don\u2019t be tempted to substitute with another traditional Mexican flour, masa harina.) \u201cFrying that bread seems like a lot of work, but it\u2019s a simple two-step process,\u201d says Chef Mauro. \u201cThe sweetness from the cranberry and earthiness of the Brie, tangy mustard and tartness of the apple \u2014 it\u2019s really amazing. Even my 3-year-old enjoyed it.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/22/health/Well_veggie_sandwich3/Well_veggie_sandwich3-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 37}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups masarepa blanca", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "2 to 2 1/2 cups warm water", "1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1 8- to 12-ounce wedge of good Brie cheese, rind removed and sliced thin", "Leftover cranberry sauce, the less gelatinous the better", "1 green apple, peeled and sliced into half moons", "Arugula", "Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees, with a rack set in the middle position."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk masarepa, salt and baking powder until combined.
