{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oatmeal Sandwich Cookies", "description": "Forget all the bad, soggy oatmeal cookies you\u2019ve ever had in your life. Picture instead a moist-centered, butterscotch-imbued, crisp-edged cookie flecked with nubby oats. Add to this the fragrant nuttiness of toasted coconut. Then subtract any chewy raisins that may have accidentally wandered into the picture, and substitute sweet, soft dates, guaranteed not to stick in your teeth. Now mentally sandwich two of these cookies with a mascarpone-cream cheese filling. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ll find here. An oatmeal cookie with a little something extra, a recipe made for keeping. You can bake the cookies a few days ahead, but they are best filled within a few hours of serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/17/multimedia/clark-oatmeal-cookies/clark-oatmeal-cookies-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "18 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, weekday", "keywords": "cream cheese, dates, mascarpone, rolled oats, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 280}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 313, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "184 milligrams", "sugarContent": "28 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["80 grams shredded sweetened coconut flakes (3/4 cup)", "1 cup unsalted butter, softened", "330 grams packed dark brown sugar (1 3/4 cups)", "2 tablespoons honey", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "190 grams all-purpose flour (1 1/2 cups)", "7 grams fine sea salt (1 teaspoon)", "3 grams baking powder (1 teaspoon)", "8 grams ground cinnamon (4 teaspoons)", "260 grams rolled oats (3 cups)", "100 grams dates, pitted and chopped (1/2 cup)", "65 grams granulated sugar (5 tablespoons)", "6 ounces cream cheese, softened", "6 tablespoons mascarpone", "25 grams confectioner's sugar (3 tablespoons)", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
