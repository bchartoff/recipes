{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dubonnet Cocktail", "description": "Now that a reformulated Dubonnet has been introduced in the United States, a cocktail is in order. The most famous one is this mix of Dubonnet and London dry gin; this recipe is endorsed by Lynn House, a bartender and brand representative for Heaven Hill, the distiller that makes Dubonnet in the United States. She helped reconfigure the American recipe for Dubonnet. This cocktail is a bit stronger than that reportedly preferred by Queen Elizabeth II, who opts for two parts Dubonnet to one part gin. The recipe works equally well on the rocks. Another old cocktail that once went by the same name calls for dry sherry instead of gin. It is also worth a try.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/20/dining/20dubonnetrex/20dubonnetrex-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "dubonnet, gin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 16}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 147, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": null, "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounce Dubonnet", "1 1/2 ounce London dry gin, preferably Beefeater", "Orange twist, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing glass half filled with ice, combine the Dubonnet and gin, and stir until well chilled, about 30 seconds.
