{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Summer Berry Buckle", "description": "Softer and more fruit-filled than a coffeecake, but with a higher percentage of buttery batter than a cobbler, buckles are harder to classify than they are to make. This one is tender, moist and filled with sweet summer berries. But feel free to substitute any other juicy fruit that you like: peaches, nectarines, figs, plums or pineapple. If your fruit is very sweet (figs, pineapple), reduce the sugar by a couple of tablespoons, while tart fruit (plums or tart blackberries) may need an extra tablespoon. Buckles are best eaten on the same day they are baked. But since they come together so quickly, you don\u2019t have to plan ahead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/24/dining/24BERRYBUCKLE/24BERRYBUCKLE-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "berries, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1213}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 276, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "188 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/114 grams (1 stick) butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing pan", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar, more for sprinkling", "1/4 cup/55 grams light brown sugar", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon/5 grams finely grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "1 1/4 cups/156 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "4 1/2 cups summer berries (a mix of blueberries, raspberries, blackberries or use any one kind)", "Cinnamon, for dusting (optional)", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
