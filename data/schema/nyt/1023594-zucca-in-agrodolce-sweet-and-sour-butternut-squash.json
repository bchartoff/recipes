{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Zucca in Agrodolce (Sweet and Sour Butternut Squash)", "description": "Squash marinated in vinegar is prepared differently from region to region in Italy. In Sicily, an agrodolce (sweet and sour) marinade, along with thinly sliced garlic and fresh mint, enlivens the palate. Typically, the squash is pan-fried, but it works just as well baked in the oven, as done here. How much sugar you use depends on the zing of your vinegar and the sweetness of your tooth. Zucca in agrodolce is best served at room temperature, and it\u2019s left to rest for just long enough so that the butternut squash soaks up the sweet and sour syrup. You can also make it a day in advance; just remember to it bring to room temperature before adding the final garnish of fresh mint and serving.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/25/dining/nd-zucca-in-agrodolce/nd-zucca-in-agrodolce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings, as a side dish", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "butternut squash, make-ahead, mint, plan-ahead, red wine vinegar, sugar, fall, thanksgiving, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 107}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds butternut squash\u00a0", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1/3 cup red wine vinegar", "2 to 4 tablespoons granulated sugar, to taste", "1 large garlic clove, thinly sliced", "20 mint leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the center position of the oven and heat oven to 400 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the butternut squash.
