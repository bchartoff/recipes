{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Mushrooms and White Beans With Buttery Bread Crumbs", "description": "Not really a ragout and not quite a gratin, this hearty meatless casserole has it all: deeply browned mushrooms, creamy white beans, salty feta and crisp bread crumbs. The result is rich, comforting and perfect for a cold night in. Fresh bread crumbs are worth making or seeking out for texture\u2019s sake, but panko will also work nicely. Toss the bread crumbs with melted butter, then briefly broil them for a golden, crunchy topping, a nice contrast to the dish\u2019s silkiness. Paired with a bright salad and a hunk of good bread, this dish works well as a vegetarian main course, or as a companion to sausages and other roasted meats.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/19/dining/ch-mushrooms-and-beans/merlin_166104657_42167c9d-2718-48e5-93cf-b5311d9dbb32-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, beans, casseroles, one pot, vegetables", "keywords": "bread crumbs, feta, mushroom, panko, shallot, thyme, white beans, fall, winter, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 663}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 pound mixed mushrooms, such as cremini, shiitake or oyster, torn or roughly chopped into bite-size pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon butter", "1 small shallot, finely chopped", "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "1 (15-ounce) can white beans (such as cannellini or great Northern), drained and rinsed", "4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (about 1 cup)", "1 cup vegetable stock, chicken stock or water", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped Italian parsley", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3/4 cup fresh, coarse bread crumbs or panko", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
