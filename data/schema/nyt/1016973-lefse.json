{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lefse", "description": "Lefse, thin potato-dough flatbreads like Scandinavian tortillas, or Oslo injera, can be found on holiday tables throughout the upper Midwest, wherever Norwegian families settled to farm. The recipe is adapted from Ethel Ramstad, 90, who learned it from one Ollie Amundson in North Dakota decades ago. We picked it up when she was teaching it to Molly Yeh, 25, a Chicago-raised food blogger marrying Ms. Ramstad's great-nephew, on a farm in the Red River Valley, right before Thanksgiving. \n\nThe riced potato mixture that forms the basis of the dough should be very, very cold when it is rolled out, to prevent stickiness. And although you do not need a lefse griddle to make great lefse, a lefse stick \u2014 essentially a long, thin, wooden spatula \u2014 is an admirable investment in success.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19NORTHDAKOTA/19NORTHDAKOTA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H20M", "recipeYield": "About 18 large or 36 small lefse", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 40}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 270, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "225 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 pounds/2 1/4 kilograms red-skinned potatoes, peeled and cut into uniform size", "2/3 cup/158 milliliters neutral oil, such as canola", "1 (5-ounce) can/148 milliliters evaporated milk", "1/2 cup/100 grams sugar", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 1/2 to 3 cups/312 to 375 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.

Brush excess flour from dough. Use a lefse stick to carefully transfer to grill (use a thin spatula if cooking in a pan). Cook for 1 minute, or until lefse is steaming and small bubbles appear on uncooked side. Using lefse stick or spatula, flip lefse and cook for 45 seconds or so. Place lefse on a clean dish towel and cover with another. Repeat, stacking lefse atop one another between the dish towels."}]}
