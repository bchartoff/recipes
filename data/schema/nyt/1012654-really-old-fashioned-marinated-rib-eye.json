{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Really Old-Fashioned Marinated Rib-Eye", "description": "This is an ancient Northern Italian preparation. To improve the flavor of the meat, this powerful marinade relied on rich local wine, along with aromatic spices. Start with a relatively thin rib-eye. Marinate for one to three days. (We tried one of these steaks after a 30-minute marinade; it was good, but different. Try longer first.) The cooking should be quick and hot, in a heavy pan, for just about two minutes per side; you might generate a bit of smoke but the cooking time is short enough that it will be tolerable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/dining/rib-eye/rib-eye-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "beef, beef rib-eye, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 81}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 454, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "567 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 bottle rich, full-bodied red wine, preferably Amarone", "2 tablespoons sugar", "6 whole cloves", "1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon", "1 teaspoon orange zest", "2 8- to 12-ounce rib-eye steaks, about 1/2-inch thick", "Salt", "pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine wine and sugar in a large pot and bring to boil; lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
