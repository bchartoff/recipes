It takes about 2 hours for the hocks to become tender, but once your kitchen fills with the smell of ham bubbling away in a pot of vinegary cider, you\u2019ll never want that slow simmer to end. If you like really sour collards, add a splash of apple cider vinegar once the greens have finished braising.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jampel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/13/dining/sj-braised-collard-greens/sj-braised-collard-greens-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "collard greens, ham hock, dairy-free, gluten-free, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 103}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 320, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "998 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 pounds smoked ham hocks", "2 onions, thinly sliced into half-moons", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon cumin", "1 teaspoon cayenne", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoons light brown sugar", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock", "1 (650-milliliter/22-ounce)\u00a0bottle hard apple cider (about 2 3/4 cups)", "2 pounds collard greens (about 3 to 4 bunches), large stems removed, washed and cut into 1/4-inch ribbons", "Hot sauce, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot with a lid over medium-high.
