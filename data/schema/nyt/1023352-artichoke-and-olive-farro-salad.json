{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Artichoke and Olive Farro Salad", "description": "Farro, a nutty Italian grain with a chewy texture, is an excellent candidate for a savory, herb-flecked pantry salad that travels well. The grain is not intimidated by bold flavors: Tangy oil-marinated artichokes, briny kalamata olives, feta and crisp red onion take wholesome farro by the hand and lead it straight to the dance floor. Cook times vary depending on the type of farro. Quick-cooking, pearled or semi-pearled all work well, but hulled is not recommended here, as it would need soaking and takes a long time to cook. Don\u2019t be shy with the oil and vinegar: The farro absorbs them the longer it sits. If farro is not available, you can use orzo (see Tip), or other hearty grains like barley, wheat berries or freekeh.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/27/dining/22COOLERSREX1/22COOLERSREX1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, grains and rice, salads and dressings, main course", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, dill, farro, feta, kalamata olives, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 328}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 cup quick-cook, pearled or semi-pearled farro, rinsed and drained (see Tip)\u00a0", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup pitted kalamata olives, sliced in half lengthwise", "About 1 cup (5.4 ounces) marinated quartered artichoke hearts from a jar, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup crumbled feta", "1/3 cup chopped fresh dill leaves", "1/4 medium red onion, finely chopped (about \u2153 cup)\u00a0", "1/4 cup thinly sliced chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set aside a sheet pan or a large plate.
