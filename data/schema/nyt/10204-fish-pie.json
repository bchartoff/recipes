{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fish Pie", "description": "To the uninitiated, fish pie has an uninviting name and reputation. But this is fish that is gently poached, then swathed in a white sauce and topped with buttery mashed potatoes and finished to a heat-bronzed finish in the oven. It is a dish good for children but can be made into unapologetic dinner-party fare by poaching the fish in a little white wine, making the white sauce with light cream rather than milk and infusing all of it with the eggy-lemony kiss of saffron. It\u2019s an hour well worth spending.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/23/dining/23COOKING-FISH-PIE1/23COOKING-FISH-PIE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, pies and tarts", "keywords": "cod, haddock, salmon fillet, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 208}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 851, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "sodiumContent": "1334 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium carrot, peeled and quartered lengthwise", "1/2 cup white wine", "Large pinch salt", "1 bouquet garni (bay leaf, fresh thyme, parsley, celery and leek, tied together in cheesecloth)", "2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks", "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing pan", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt, to taste", "8 ounces skinless cod fillets", "8 ounces skinless haddock fillets", "8 ounces skinless salmon fillets", "1/2 teaspoon powdered saffron or 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads steeped in 1 tablespoon boiling water", "1 cup light cream (or a combination of half and half and heavy cream) or as needed", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "Pinch of mace", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "5 ounces cooked, peeled shrimp", "Freshly grated nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a deep covered skillet, combine carrot, wine, salt, bouquet garni and 1/2 cup water.
