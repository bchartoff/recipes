It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nHere\u2019s a half-hour challenge that\u2019s no challenge at all. Set a large pot of salted water on the stove, over high heat. In a pan, saut\u00e9 chopped bacon \u2014 slab bacon, if you can get it \u2014 in a glug or two of olive oil until it\u2019s crisp. Remove the bacon and add chopped onion to the fat, cooking until it\u2019s soft and fragrant. Figure the equivalent of a slice of bacon and half an onion per person.\n\nMeanwhile, boil water for enough pasta to feed your crowd, and cook it until it is just shy of tender. While it cooks, add some canned chopped tomatoes and the cooked bacon to the onions, and stir it to make a sauce. Drain the pasta, then toss it with a knob of butter, and add the pasta to the sauce. Slide all that into a warm serving bowl, then top with grated pecorino. A scattering of chopped parsley is never going to be a bad idea here, but you can omit it if the clock\u2019s ticking. Serve with red-pepper flakes and extra cheese on the side.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17norecipe-amatraciana/17norecipe-amatraciana-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "bacon, canned tomatoes, pasta, pecorino, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 274}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020007-amatriciana-on-the-fly"}
