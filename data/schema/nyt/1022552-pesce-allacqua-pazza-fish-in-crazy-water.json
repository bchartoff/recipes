Once the water tastes like tomato, fish fillets are poached in it. This foolproof method prevents overcooking, so it\u2019s ideal for all kinds of delicate seafood. Some think \u201ccrazy\u201d refers to the broth\u2019s spiciness, while others think the name comes from the fact that fishermen made the dish with seawater (but it could also simply reflect that water is the key ingredient).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/09/dining/as-Pesce-allAcqua-Pazza-Fish-in-Crazy-Water/merlin_194432517_50df0139-61b5-4f1b-bba8-547cbbb59d0e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "fish, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 340}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed", "1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled if desired, coarsely chopped", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "4 (6-ounce) fillets firm or medium-firm white fish, such as sea bass or sea bream (skin on or off)", "Grilled or crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet with high sides, combine the olive oil, garlic, fennel seeds and red-pepper flakes.
