Emulsifying the deeply seasoned oil from the sardine tin with lemon juice and mustard makes the salad creamy like mayonnaise does but with flavors that are more intense and pronounced. Add any of the sharp, crunchy, fresh pops you like in your tuna or whitefish salad, such as capers, cornichons, pickled peppers or herbs, and eat this sardine salad over greens, on a bagel or English muffin, or between two slices of toast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/14/dining/as-sardine-salad/merlin_207624162_5c6f868c-eafc-4f15-afb5-ea68f613fb96-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings (about 2 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, salads and dressings, seafood, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "celery, dijon mustard, dill, sardines", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 554}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion or shallot (about 1/4 small red onion or 1/2 small shallot)", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 3 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 large lemon), plus more as needed", "Kosher salt", "2 tins sardines packed in olive oil (about 4 ounces each)", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 large celery stalk, finely chopped", "Black pepper", "2 tablespoons capers or chopped pepperoncini or cornichons (optional)", "1/4 cup dill or parsley leaves and tender stems (optional), chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, stir together the red onion, lemon zest, lemon juice and a pinch of salt.
