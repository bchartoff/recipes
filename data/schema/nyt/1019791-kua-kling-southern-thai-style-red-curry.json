{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kua Kling (Southern Thai-Style Red Curry)", "description": "Whereas larb is bright and acidic \u2014 light on its feet \u2014 this simple adaptation of a traditional Southern Thai dry red curry, is grounding and spicy. It owes much of its flavor to red curry paste, turmeric and fresh chile that have been toasted until they shake awake. For scorching heat (a curry like this is typically brutally hot), add more chile. As the chicken \u2014 though it could be ground pork, sliced beef or chicken, or mushrooms \u2014 cooks, its fat renders and the fired-up curry paste adheres. Season it with brown sugar and fish sauce, and serve with rice, cabbage, herbs, avocado, cucumber and-or a crisp fried egg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/27/dining/as-red-curry/as-red-curry-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, curries, poultry, main course", "keywords": "curry paste, ground chicken", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 782}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 249, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "385 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed", "1/4 cup Thai red curry paste (ideally one with makrut lime, lemongrass and shrimp paste)", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 Thai or serrano chiles, thinly sliced, or to taste", "1 pound ground chicken", "1/2 teaspoon dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons fish sauce", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated lime zest, or 10 makrut lime leaves, deveined and thinly sliced", "Rice, sliced cabbage, chopped herbs, sliced avocado, chopped cucumber and fried egg, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, warm the oil and toast the curry paste, turmeric and chiles (if using) until extremely fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
