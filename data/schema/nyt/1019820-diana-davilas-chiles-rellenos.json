Roasted, peeled poblanos are stuffed with a ground meat picadillo spiked with apples, raisins, cider vinegar and brown sugar, then dunked in a feathery egg batter and fried until golden. Just before serving, those stuffed, fried chiles are bathed in a brothy tomato sauce lightened with carrot juice. It does take time to put all the elements together, but you won\u2019t regret a minute of it when you taste what might be the best chiles rellenos you\u2019ve ever had: complex, sweet and spicy, and deeply brawny. At Mi Tocaya Antojer\u00eda, her restaurant in Chicago, Ms. D\u00e1vila uses a combination of chopped duck confit and ground pork for the picadillo. But using all ground pork works equally well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/12/dining/12davilarex1/merlin_147457293_04597239-7563-4b84-aa68-a9f1729e7111-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "meat, vegetables", "keywords": "apple, carrot juice, ground pork, poblano pepper, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 175}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 plum tomatoes, diced", "3 pints cherry tomatoes, preferably a mix of colors, halved", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1/4 cup sunflower or grapeseed oil", "1 large white onion, diced", "10 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 to 3 Serrano chiles, thinly sliced", "2 cups carrot juice", "1 cup chicken stock, preferably homemade", "2 tablespoons duck fat or sunflower oil", "1/2 large white onion, diced", "1 small Granny Smith apple, diced", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/4 cup raisins", "2 tablespoons cider vinegar", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "1 pound ground pork (or use a combination of ground pork and chopped duck confit)", "1/8 teaspoon crushed red-pepper flakes", "8 poblano chiles", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "4 egg yolks, lightly beaten", "6 egg whites", "Fine sea salt, as needed", "Vegetable or canola oil, for frying", "Epazote, for serving (optional)", "Chopped cilantro, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the sauce: In a large bowl, toss plum and cherry tomatoes with 1 teaspoon salt.
