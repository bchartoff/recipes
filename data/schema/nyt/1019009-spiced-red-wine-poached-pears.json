Here, the poaching syrup is red wine, honey and good cold-weather spices: cloves, cinnamon and star anise. Look for pears that are ripe but still firm, and if you can, choose pears that have stems \u2014 they make for a more attractive dish. You can serve the pears soon after they\u2019re made or you can cover and refrigerate them in their syrup and serve them chilled or at room\u00a0temperature. They\u2019re good on their own or alongside whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/29/magazine/29Paris-recipes4/29Paris-recipes4-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, pear, red wine, star anise", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 104}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 235, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "7 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "6 ripe but firm pears", "2 cups (480 milliliters) red wine", "1/2 cup (120 milliliters) water", "3 tablespoons sugar", "3 tablespoons honey", "2 whole cloves", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 whole star anise", "Lightly sweetened whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Halve the lemon, and remove 3 wide strips of rind.
