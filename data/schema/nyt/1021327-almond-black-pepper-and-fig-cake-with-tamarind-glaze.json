{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Almond, Black Pepper and Fig Cake With Tamarind Glaze", "description": "This cake celebrates the sweet, jamlike texture of juicy ripe figs against the backdrop of a fragrant almond cake, with a sweet-and-sour tamarind glaze as contrast. As the cake bakes, the fresh figs release their juices, which begin to caramelize and take on the flavor of black pepper. Tellicherry black peppercorns and long pepper, if available, are wonderful options to explore for their unique aromas. Frozen fresh figs will also work in this cake. Just remember to thaw them to room temperature and drain off any excess liquid before using. And, make sure to use tamarind paste, not concentrate. Thick, syrupy concentrates lack the fruity flavor of tamarind and carry a noticeable artificial aftertaste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10tamarindrex3-cake/10tamarindrex3-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "birthday, figs, greek yogurt, tamarind, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 214}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted, plus more for greasing the baking dish", "12 to 14 fresh ripe figs", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar, plus 2 tablespoons", "2 cups/225 grams blanched almond flour", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 large eggs, chilled", "1 cup/240 milliliters full-fat plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt", "1 teaspoon almond extract", "1 cup/125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 tablespoons <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021264-tamarind-paste\">tamarind paste</a> (not concentrate)", "1 teaspoon olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
