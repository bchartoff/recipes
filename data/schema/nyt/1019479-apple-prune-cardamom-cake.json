It\u2019s on the menu at their restaurant Bavel in Los Angeles, where it\u2019s served hot from the oven with date toffee sauce and whipped cream. You can serve this cake version with your favorite toffee or caramel sauce and ice cream. It makes a lovely dessert after a Rosh Hashana supper or as part of a spread to break the Yom Kippur fast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/12/dining/12orirex2/12orirex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "apple, apple cider, cardamom, prune, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 21}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 327, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "346 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/170 grams lightly packed chopped prunes", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/270 milliliters good apple cider", "1 cup/170 grams grated apple (Pink Lady or other tart variety, peeled, grated and firmly packed)", "7 tablespoons/100 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for buttering the pan", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/145 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/40 grams einkorn flour (or use whole wheat pastry flour)", "2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "2 1/2 teaspoons cardamom", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/2 cup/92 grams packed muscovado sugar, or 1/2 cup/110 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 large eggs", "Whipped cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or ice cream for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the prunes in a medium bowl and pour in the apple cider.
