The trinity of corn, beans and squash was central to the agriculture of the Plains Indians in what would later become Wyoming, and some cooks honor that history each Thanksgiving with a dish called Three Sisters stew. The writer Pamela Sinclair\u2019s version is a highlight of her 2008 cookbook, \u201cA Taste of Wyoming: Favorite Recipes From the Cowboy State.\u201d The stew works nicely as a rich side dish for turkey, and can easily be adapted to vegetarian tastes by omitting the pork and adding a pound of cubed butternut squash instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19WYOMING/19WYOMING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "black beans, corn, pinto beans, pork loin, tomatoes, turkey stock, yellow squash, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1122}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 389, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1071 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound trimmed pork loin, cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "Kosher salt, as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola", "1 large yellow onion, diced", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "4 cups turkey or chicken stock, preferably homemade or low-sodium", "1 medium yellow squash, diced", "1 (15-ounce) can pinto beans, drained", "1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained", "1 (14 1/2-ounce) can chopped tomatoes", "2 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels", "1 (4-ounce) can roasted green chiles (1/2 cup)", "1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season pork with cumin, salt and pepper.
