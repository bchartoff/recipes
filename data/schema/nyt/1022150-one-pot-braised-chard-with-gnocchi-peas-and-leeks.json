{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Braised Chard With Gnocchi, Peas and Leeks", "description": "Adding a package of prepared potato gnocchi to a pot of braised greens turns a side dish into a vibrant one-pot meal fit for weeknights. The chard stems, leeks and peas are nubby and colorful next to the pillowy gnocchi, while a combination of butter and white wine makes the sauce rich and tangy. For extra creaminess, serve this with dollops of fresh ricotta stirred in at the last minute. Or skip the ricotta for a lighter meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/30/dining/30AppeRex/merlin_186774966_1c676688-bb40-4ec7-b4b7-a10eae74fa04-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, one pot, pastas, main course", "keywords": "dry white wine, dutch oven, gnocchi, leek, peas, swiss chard, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1970}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 leeks, white and light green parts, sliced thinly into half-moons", "1 pound chard, preferably rainbow or red\u00a0(about 2 bunches), stems thinly sliced and leaves coarsely chopped", "3 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated", "2 teaspoons chopped thyme leaves", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup dry white wine", "3 cups vegetable or chicken stock", "1 pound potato gnocchi (fresh, frozen or shelf-stable all work)", "2 cups peas, fresh or frozen", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon leaves", "1 cup torn parsley leaves and tender stems, for serving", "Grated Parmesan, for serving", "Lemon wedges, for serving", "Fresh ricotta, for serving (optional)", "Red-pepper flakes, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 5- or 6-quart Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat.
