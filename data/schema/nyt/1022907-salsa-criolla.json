{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salsa Criolla", "description": "This popular Peruvian condiment requires only five ingredients, but it\u2019s bursting with flavor. Slivered onions and fresh peppers are marinated in lime juice to create a tangy and spicy relish. Traditionally, the salsa is made with fresh aji amarillo chiles, which can be difficult to find; luckily, a combination of orange bell pepper and serrano chiles deliver similar flavor, color and heat. (For a milder salsa, remove the seeds from the serrano before using.) Most often served with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022908-arroz-con-pollo-verde\">arroz con pollo</a>, this bright relish is also a perfect accompaniment to roasted chicken, and makes a great topping on tacos and sandwiches. The salsa can be refrigerated for three days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/18/dining/kc-salsa-criolla/merlin_199948983_f759cd2e-78f1-4650-a888-9b5801a5a882-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments, vegetables", "keywords": "bell pepper, red onion, serrano chile", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 143}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large red onion, halved and very thinly sliced into half moons (2 cups)", "1/2 small orange bell pepper, cored, seeded and very thinly sliced lengthwise (\u00bd cup)", "1 serrano chile, thinly sliced or finely chopped", "3 tablespoons lime juice (from 2 limes)", "2 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro", "Kosher salt\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine the onion, bell pepper, serrano chile, lime juice and cilantro, and mix well.
