{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Norwegian Pumpkin Soup", "description": "I call my soup Norwegian Pumpkin Soup, but not because it emanates from Norway. It's just that I add to the cooked and blended pumpkin a couple of cupfuls of Norwegian Jarlsberg cheese; if you wish to turn this into Swiss Pumpkin Soup, no geographical sleight of hand is needed. You just use Gruy\u00e8re. Either way, the sweet nuttiness of the mild, deep-flavored cheese adds depth and tone (and protein) to the pumpkin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/25/dining/pumpkinsoup/pumpkinsoup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "one pot, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, cheese, pumpkin, fall, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 71}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 432, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1153 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon salt, or more as needed", "5 cups 1/2-inch cubed pumpkin, from about 1 1/2 pounds unpeeled pumpkin", "1 teaspoon ground mace", "4 cups hot homemade or canned vegetable stock", "3 cups grated Jarlsberg cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a wide pan over medium heat, heat oil.
