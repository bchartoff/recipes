{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nanaimo Bars", "description": "The Nanaimo bar is a tremendously sweet, no-bake layered bar cookie from Canada made almost exclusively of packaged ingredients. The buttercream layer gets its yellow hue from custard powder, a vital ingredient that makes this a true Nanaimo bar. Use an offset spatula to give the chocolate top a surface as smooth as freshly Zambonied ice. The novelist Margaret Atwood included this recipe, from the chef Susan Mendelson, in her \u201cCanlit Foodbook,\u201d a fund-raising book that featured food from literature, as well as author recipes. Ms. Atwood prefers walnuts in this recipe, but any combination of walnuts, almonds or pecans will do. We\u2019ve added a smidge more cocoa and the optional addition of salt \u2014 but leave it out for the true Nanaimo bar experience.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/27/dining/22nanaimorex/merlin_150934053_2e941dba-a5b4-4183-a991-8d2eb3428fb8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "16 bars", "recipeCuisine": "canadian", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "coconut, custard powder, graham cracker crumbs, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 495}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 344, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "118 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into pieces", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "3 tablespoons cocoa powder", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups/235 grams graham cracker crumbs", "1 cup/85 grams unsweetened shredded coconut", "1/2 cup/50 grams finely chopped walnuts, almonds or pecans (or a mixture)", "1/4 cup/60 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), at room temperature", "3 tablespoons heavy cream", "2 tablespoons custard powder, such as Bird\u2019s", "2 cups/245 grams confectioners\u2019 (icing) sugar", "4 ounces/115 grams semisweet chocolate, broken into 1/2-inch (1 1/4-centimeter) pieces", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line an 8-by-8-inch (20-by-20-centimeter) metal baking pan with parchment, allowing parchment to overhang by about 2 inches (5 centimeters) on two sides."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the base: In a double boiler, or a heatproof bowl placed over a saucepan of boiling water, whisk butter with granulated sugar, egg, cocoa powder and vanilla until melted.
