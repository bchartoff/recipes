Originally named \u201cwhiskey cocktail,\u201d it\u2019s a stirred, spirit-forward drink classically based on bourbon or rye. But out of want or necessity, you can venture outside tradition. This version uses 2-to-1 \u201crich\u201d simple syrup, which is sweeter and thicker than the standard 1-to-1 ratio of sugar and water, but allows you to use less without sacrificing texture. This cocktail offers many a substitution; the only nonnegotiable is to use a spirit you like, as it serves as leading lady in this cocktail hour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/dining/07cocktailrex1/merlin_172221690_f0f1a903-96cf-4be8-8903-d988cf547448-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "angostura bitters, citrus, gin, mezcal, rum, sugar, tequila, turbinado sugar, whiskey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 205}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup granulated or turbinado sugar", "Ice, as needed", "2 ounces whiskey (such as bourbon or rye), brandy, rum or gin (or even 1 1/2 ounces tequila plus 1/2 ounce mezcal)", "1/2 ounce 2-to-1 simple syrup (or to taste), or 1 sugar cube", "3 to 4 dashes Angostura or orange bitters", "Citrus twist (orange or lemon or whatever you have), or a maraschino cherry and a dash of its juice (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the simple syrup: In a small saucepan, combine sugar with 1/4 cup water.
