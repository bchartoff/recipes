{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggplant Stuffed With Rice and Tomatoes", "description": "Travel anywhere in the Mediterranean region, and you will find stuffed vegetables. In Provence, they tend to be filled with meat (a way to stretch leftover stews), but in the Middle East and Greece rice and grain fillings prevail. Regional cooks make abundant use of fresh herbs like parsley, dill and mint, and sweet spices like cinnamon and allspice. Fragrant stuffed vegetables can be made ahead of the meal and served hot or at room temperature. They don\u2019t require a lot of patience to assemble \u2014 they just need a long simmer and then a rest to let the flavors mingle and intensify. Eat them as a main dish or a side, and serve up leftovers for lunch. The filling for these irresistible stuffed eggplants is also good for peppers and squash. Substitute the chopped flesh of the summer squash for the eggplant, and just use the rice and tomatoes for peppers. Make these a day ahead for best results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/29/health/29recipehealth/29recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves six", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "basmati rice, eggplant, tomato, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 210, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "882 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 to 3 pounds small or medium eggplants", "Salt to taste", "1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, grated on the large holes of a box grater", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "4 to 6 garlic cloves to taste, minced", "1/2 cup uncooked long-grain or basmati rice", "1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro", "3 tablespoons finely chopped mint", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "Juice of 2 lemons", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon sugar", "3 tablespoons tomato paste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the eggplants in half.
