Kimchi carbonara, which she was seeing all over Korean TikTok, spoke to her. \u201cI love how Korea somewhat recently started introducing cheese on everything,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cI\u2019m all for it, especially being from the Midwest.\u201d This is her take on the cultural mashup as a Korean adoptee. She cooks down napa cabbage kimchi until soft, and cuts through the buttery base with white wine. The dish comes together quickly, so have everything prepped and ready to go before starting the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Elyse Inamine"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/03/dining/03Korean-Adoptees-Rex3/merlin_208263279_6c13888a-cd7b-4d38-83cc-fbd871722a7e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian, korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "egg, kimchi, parmesan, spaghetti, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 809}, "recipeIngredient": ["Coarse kosher salt", "1 pound thick spaghetti", "4 tablespoons salted butter", "1 small shallot, minced (1 tablespoon)", "6 medium garlic cloves, minced (2 tablespoons)", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1/4 cup dry white wine, such as Chardonnay", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 cup diced napa cabbage kimchi", "1/4 cup kimchi juice (see Tip)", "3 large egg yolks, at room temperature", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "1 cup red spinach or regular spinach, thinly sliced", "Gochugaru (Korean red-chile flakes), for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot of salted water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente.
