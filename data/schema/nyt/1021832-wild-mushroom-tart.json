{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wild Mushroom Tart", "description": "This savory tart features a quickly made puff pastry. (You can use store-bought, if you wish, but this dough is easy and fun.) There\u2019s enough for two tarts, so store half in the freezer, rolled out, for later use. Make the dough up to a day or two in advance, and use chanterelles or other pale wild mushrooms, if possible. If using cultivated mushrooms, a combination of sliced shiitake, white button, oyster or king trumpet would be nice, as portobellos or cremini make a dark, somber-looking tart. Serve as a first course or as a light lunch, accompanied by a simple green salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/10/dining/05Tanisrex1/05Tanisrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 generous or 6 restrained portions", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, vegetables, appetizer", "keywords": "cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, mushroom, onion, thyme, valentine\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 779}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1 cup/225 grams cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut in 1/4-inch cubes", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters ice water", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little more as needed", "1 onion, any kind, sliced into 1/4-inch half-moons (about 1 1/2 cups)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "10 ounces/300 grams wild mushrooms, such as chanterelle, or cultivated shiitake, oyster or king trumpet mushrooms, sliced (about 4 cups)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 teaspoons chopped thyme", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "3 tablespoons grated Parmesan", "2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the tart dough: Put the 2 cups flour and salt in the chilled bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
