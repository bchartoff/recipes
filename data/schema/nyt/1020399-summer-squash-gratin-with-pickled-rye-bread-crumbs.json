{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Summer Squash Gratin With Pickled Rye Bread Crumbs", "description": "This rustic casserole was first developed using a specialty pickled rye bread from Carissa\u2019s The Bakery in East Hampton, N.Y. The same effect is achieved in this recipe by mixing fresh rye bread crumbs (or even white bread crumbs) with a splash of pickle juice. Summer squash and zucchini are layered with caramelized onions, Gruy\u00e8re and a handful of the bread crumbs, which help absorb excess moisture. If you can find patty pan squash, it makes for a particularly beautiful presentation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/12/dining/lh-summer-squash-gratin/lh-summer-squash-gratin-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, summer, gruy\u00e8re, onion, pickles, rye bread, summer squash, thyme, zucchini, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds medium zucchini, yellow summer squash or a combination, trimmed", "Kosher salt", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 stick)", "3 cups rye bread crumbs (about 8 ounces), preferably from day-old seeded or seedless loaf", "3 tablespoons pickle juice, from a jar of dill pickles", "1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon minced garlic (about 2 large cloves)", "1 teaspoon roughly chopped fresh thyme leaves", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 1/2 cups grated Gruy\u00e8re (about 4 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
