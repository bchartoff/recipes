{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoked Trout Frittatas", "description": "There isn\u2019t much in the way of food that tart, citric, sometimes spicy and often refreshing Austrian rieslings can\u2019t handle with aplomb. Spring\u2019s challenges, like artichokes, asparagus and salads, would not daunt them. Nor would eggs. In fact, the whiff of sulfur up front in some of the wines suggested eggs.Here\u2019s a simple brunch or lunch preparation suited to entertaining. Individual frittatalike mixtures, inspired by the Spanish tortilla of eggs, potatoes and onions, with the addition of smoked trout, are baked, not fried. They can be made up to an hour in advance and reheated or even served just warm. A salad is all that\u2019s needed alongside, and do not hesitate to toss in some asparagus or artichokes.
