In the late '90s, the chef Eric Ripert said, \u201cEverybody was a bit, I think, crazy and inclined to indulge in excess because of the end of the millennium.\" His contribution to the madness was this croque-monsieur layered not with ham and b\u00e9chamel but with something even more indulgent: smoked salmon, Gruy\u00e8re and caviar on brioche. Make it home, and don't look at the grocery bill. It is in service of luxurious flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/04/dining/Salmon-Caviar/Salmon-Caviar-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves 2 to 4", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, gruy\u00e8re, smoked salmon, sturgeon caviar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 slices fine-textured brioche or white bread, crusts removed", "About 1 1/2 ounces Swiss Gruy\u00e8re cheese, sliced paper thin", "1 ounce fresh or pasteurized sturgeon caviar", "2 to 4 slices smoked Atlantic ++or Norwegian salmon", "2 tablespoons clarified butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the bread on a work surface.
