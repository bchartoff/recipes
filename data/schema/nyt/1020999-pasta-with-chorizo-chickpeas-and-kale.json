{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Chorizo, Chickpeas and Kale", "description": "Packed with the intense flavors of garlic, paprika and salt, dried chorizo sets the flavor profile of this pasta. First, the chorizo sears in a skillet to render some of its fat and flavor, then chickpeas, scallions and kale soak up its spices. Salty Manchego cheese maintains the Spanish vibes, but Parmesan or pecorino work equally well. While eight ounces of pasta might not seem like a lot, meaty chickpeas and hearty kale complete the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/15/dining/15Pasta-Chorizo-Chickpeas-Kale-a/merlin_171317148_4f924285-2110-4e51-8595-016e89ea9549-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, beans, pastas, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "cheese, chickpea, chorizo sausage, kale, pasta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 576}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 ounces fusilli or other short pasta", "1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "7 to 8 ounces dried chorizo, thinly sliced", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1 bunch scallions (6 to 8), thinly sliced", "1 bunch curly kale, collard greens or mustard greens, stems removed, leaves torn into bite-size pieces", "Shaved Manchego, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
