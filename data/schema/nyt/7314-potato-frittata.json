Cook over medium heat until the eggs are lightly browned on the bottom. Loosen the eggs around the edges and shake the pan to make sure the frittata is loose in the pan. Flip it over by placing a large plate on the pan, turning both plate and pan over together, then sliding the frittata back into the pan. Cook the frittata another few minutes. Instead of flipping the frittata, the top side of it can be lightly browned under a broiler. Either transfer the frittata to a serving platter or serve it directly from the pan."}]}
