{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Barley and Herb Salad With Roasted Asparagus", "description": "When fat stalks of asparagus come into the markets, what better thing to do with them than roast or grill them? What\u2019s more, the California chef and teacher John Ash, demonstrating a recipe at the recent \u201cHealthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives\u201d conference at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley \u2013 an event that bridges health care, nutrition science and cooking \u2013 insists that not only does asparagus taste better when it\u2019s not cooked in or near water, but also that it doesn\u2019t cause that distinctive odor in urine many people experience after eating it. I can\u2019t vouch for the latter claim, but asparagus is intensely delicious when you roast it And it\u2019s a beautiful addition to this lemony mix of barley and herbs. For the herbs, I like to mix sweet (tarragon, chives) with bitter (parsley, marjoram, thyme). Cooked barley will keep for 3 days in the refrigerator and can be frozen. The dressed grains will be good for 2 to 3 days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/05/science/07recipehealth/07recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 as a main dish salad, 6 as a side", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, dairy-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 47}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 449, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "895 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup barley", "3 cups water", "Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste", "1 pound thick-stemmed asparagus", "2 tablespoons extra- virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/2 cup chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, marjoram, chives, tarragon and thyme", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "Salt to taste", "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "1 small garlic clove, pur\u00e9ed", "1/2 teaspoon dry mustard or 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "6 tablespoons extra- virgin olive oil", "Lemon wedges or sliced lemon for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a 3- quart saucepan over medium-high heat and add barley.
