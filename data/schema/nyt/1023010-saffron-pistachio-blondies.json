{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saffron Pistachio Blondies", "description": "Saffron and pistachio, a combination known to many on the Indian subcontinent as kesar pista, is a classic flavoring in South Asian, Iranian and other desserts \u2014 and for good reason. The buttery richness of pistachios brings out the floral flavor in saffron. Kesar pista shines in other sweets like this nutty twist on a blondie. Seth Byrum, my partner and an avid home baker, suggested enriching the base with white chocolate, which feels reminiscent of khoya, the richly flavored milk solids in several South Asian confections. The radiantly golden frosting lets the saffron do the talking. Garnish the top with pistachios to mimic the top of more traditional South Asian sweets, like shrikhand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/09/dining/07HOLIREX-saffron-pistachio-bars/merlin_202736367_9d208d1e-d43f-4cd4-b3f9-af18fb0fae17-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pan", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "blondie, butter, cream cheese, pistachio, saffron, white chocolate chips", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 849}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/112 grams raw, unsalted pistachios, plus more for garnish", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt\u00a0", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "3/4 cup/173 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled\u00a0", "1 1/4 packed cups/250 grams dark brown sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature\u00a0", "1/2 cup/87 grams white chocolate chips", "1/2 teaspoon/.33 gram packed saffron threads", "1 1/2 tablespoons whole milk\u00a0", "6 ounces/170 grams cream cheese, softened\u00a0", "1/3 cup/77 grams unsalted butter, softened\u00a0", "2/3 cup/93 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Pinch of coarse kosher salt\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the bars: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
