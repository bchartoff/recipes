{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Halibut Fillets With Creamy Saffron Sauce", "description": "If your experience with saffron is that it fades into the background, you have not been cooking with real saffron. There is no easier way to remedy this than to stir it into an uncooked, yogurt-based sauce in which it plays a leading role. (A touch of mild Aleppo pepper is a fine addition, but a pinch of cayenne \u2014 just enough to give a suspicion of its presence \u2014 also does nicely.) I like this concoction, which takes just a couple of minutes to prepare, with halibut or other mild fish. The halibut can be lightly poached in butter (you don\u2019t need much!) or, if you prefer, steamed or baked with no fat, until just tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "halibut fillet, saffron, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 310, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "45 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "740 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup yogurt, preferably full-fat", "Salt and pepper", "Large pinch Aleppo pepper or small pinch cayenne", "1 shallot, peeled and minced", "1/2 teaspoon saffron threads", "Juice of 1/2 lemon, or more to taste", "2 pounds halibut fillet, in 2 or 4 pieces", "2 tablespoons butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk yogurt together with salt, pepper, Aleppo pepper or cayenne, and shallot.
