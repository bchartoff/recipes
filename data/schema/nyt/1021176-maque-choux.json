{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maque Choux", "description": "This classic Cajun side dish is a sweet, hot, juicy, milky, buttery combination of corn, onions and peppers.\u00a0It\u2019s often cooked in rendered bacon fat and enriched with heavy cream, but this version relies upon only butter and a little water in their place, which allow the ingredients\u2019 flavors to sing more clearly. While it is commonly understood that Fat Equals Flavor, there is a point at which too much fat actually masks complexities in flavors and dulls their\u00a0vibrancy. Try the maque choux this way and see if you notice how bold and lively it tastes. If you miss the smokiness that bacon imparts, try instead a pinch of smoked paprika stirred in at the end.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/21/magazine/21mag-eat/21mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 1 generous quart", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "bell pepper, butter, celery, corn, poblano chile, red onion, serrano chile, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 737}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 fresh ears of corn, shucked", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick)", "1/2 red onion, cut into small dice", "2 celery ribs, cut into small dice", "Kosher salt", "1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and cut into small dice", "1 small poblano pepper, cored, seeded and cut into small dice", "1 small serrano chile, very thinly sliced", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Smoked paprika (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Working with 1 corn cob at a time, set the ear of corn upright in a medium bowl.
