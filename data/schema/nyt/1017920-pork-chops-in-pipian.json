{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Chops in Pipian", "description": "This is a recipe built on my memory of a dish I ate in a sticky-tabled Mexican restaurant in pregentrification Park Slope, Brooklyn: fried pork chops served over a thick, spicy sauce of seeds and nuts and chiles \u2014 what the cookbooks and histories of Mexican food call pipian, for the pepitas, or pumpkin seeds, used in its creation. It is hardly authentic, but it is simple to make and hugely delicious. Make sure to get a good hard sear on the pork chops before nestling them into the sauce, then serve with tortillas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/10/magazine/10eat1/10mag-10eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "main course, pork chop", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 197}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 795, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "56 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1161 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium-thick pork chops, bone-in or boneless", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons neutral oil", "8 chiles de \u00e1rbol", "3 plum tomatoes", "1 small onion, peeled and thickly sliced", "3 cloves garlic, unpeeled", "1/2 cup raw, hulled, unsalted pumpkin seeds", "1/3 cup unsalted peanuts", "1/3 cup hulled sesame seeds", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice (or 2 allspice berries)", "1 canned chipotle pepper", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, lard or chicken fat", "1 cup chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon cider vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Remove the stems from the chiles de \u00e1rbol, and gently roll the chiles between your fingers to remove the seeds.
