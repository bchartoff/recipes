{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Andouille Sausage, Beans and Greens", "description": "Highly seasoned Andouille sausage makes this pasta extra-zippy, while white beans and collard greens give it a rustic flair. They are not ingredients typically used in pasta, but this dish may become part of your regular rotation once you try it. This one-dish dinner is perfect for cold, cozy nights when you want something hearty to stick to your bones, but it will satisfy any time. Swirling in lemon juice and olive oil just before serving adds freshness and ties all of the flavors together.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/02/dining/-VL-pasta-with-andouille-sausage-beans-greens/merlin_198267657_28fdd43e-181b-4497-b34a-011628aa0a0e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "andouille sausage, cannellini beans, collard greens, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1476}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and black pepper", "1 pound rigatoni or any pasta with ridges", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "12 ounces Andouille sausage, diced", "1 shallot, minced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 bunch collard greens, stems discarded, leaves coarsely chopped (4 1/2 cups)", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed", "1 cup diced fresh tomato (from 1 large)", "1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1/4 cup thinly sliced chives", "1 lemon, zested and cut into wedges, for serving", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
