{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Cake", "description": "With just a 9-by-13 pan, a spoon and four store-bought ingredients, you can make an ice cream cake that\u2019s creamy, crunchy and fudgy in every bite. It starts with crushed chocolate-mint cookies that are covered with mint chocolate chip ice cream. Next, it\u2019s topped with a layer of ice cream sandwiches, with their cakey cookies and vanilla ice cream. Follow that with more mint chip ice cream, and you\u2019ve made a six-layer cake without breaking a sweat. Feel free to experiment here: Swap out the mint cookies for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018581-snickerdoodles\">snickerdoodles</a>, pretzels or broken waffle cones, and the mint-chip ice cream for coffee, peanut butter or strawberry ice cream \u2014 or any combination that sounds good to you. Slice the cake into pieces big or small, then drizzle them with hot fudge or Magic Shell. This cake serves a crowd, but you can halve the ingredients and build it in an 8-by-8-inch pan for a smaller group.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/29/dining/as-mint-chocolate-chip-ice-cream-cake2/merlin_158598186_2e9c4227-25ca-497d-ba76-ed5a12e199de-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13-inch cake (15 to 18 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "chocolate, hot fudge sauce, ice cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 307}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups coarsely crushed crisp chocolate-mint or chocolate cookies (about 10 ounces)", "2 (1.5-quart) cartons or 6 pints mint chocolate chip ice cream", "12 full-size rectangular ice cream sandwiches", "Store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6094-hot-fudge-sauce\">homemade hot fudge sauce</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013489-chocolate-shell-ice-cream-topping\">Magic Shell</a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a 9-by-13-inch pan with two layers of plastic wrap, leaving a few inches of overhang on all sides.
