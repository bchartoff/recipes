Mexican sopa de alb\u00f3ndigas is no exception. Most variations are likely to involve vegetables, rice, a tomato-based broth and, inevitably, meatballs. Wesley Avila, the chef of Guerrilla Tacos in Los Angeles, learned this recipe from his mother, who learned it from her grandmother. His meatballs are hefty in size but light in density, and follow his family\u2019s tradition of adding uncooked white rice to the pork-beef mixture before shaping it into balls and cooking: \u201cMy mom always told me that when the rice is done, the soup is ready,\u201d Mr. Avila said. \u201cShe used it almost as a timer.\u201d The toppings \u2014 piled on as you would atop chili \u2014 skew cheffy, but they are entirely optional.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/14/dining/aw-albondigas/aw-albondigas-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef, cumin, garlic, mint, onion, oregano, pork, potato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 350}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds ground beef", "1 pound ground pork", "1/2 cup uncooked long-grain rice", "1/3 cup chopped fresh mint", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil", "1 medium yellow onion, peeled and diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "4 medium carrots, peeled and cut on an angle into 1/2-inch slices", "3 medium celery stalks, peeled and cut on an angle into 1/2-inch slices", "1 large red potato, cut into 1-inch cubes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "2 bay leaves", "2 teaspoons dried oregano, preferably Mexican", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "8 cups chicken stock (2 quarts)", "1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce", "Crumbled queso fresco, panela or cotija", "2 avocados, halved lengthwise, pitted and thinly sliced crosswise or diced", "Mini sweet peppers, thinly sliced into rounds", "Serrano and habanero chiles, very thinly sliced", "Small fresh cilantro sprigs or chopped fresh cilantro", "Lime wedges, for squeezing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, rice, mint, garlic, salt and pepper.
