Seasoned cast iron is good, and so is a heavy nonstick pan that can go into the oven. Moisten your hands lightly and shape 4 large or 6 smaller patties. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan and, working in batches if necessary, cook the burgers for 2 minutes on one side, until nicely browned. Carefully turn the patties over and place the pan in the oven. Bake 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and lay thin slices of Gruy\u00e8re on top of each burger. Return to the oven and bake for another 5 minutes, or the patties are lightly browned and the cheese has melted. Remove from the heat and serve, with or without buns, ketchup and the works."}]}
