{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Zucchini and Tomato Tartlets With a Cheddar Crust", "description": "These individual tartlets have a Cheddar-spiked, buttery crust holding a filling of honey-drizzled roasted vegetables and creamy ricotta. You can use any roasted vegetables here, changing up the mix to suit the seasons. Late summer is perfect for some combination of zucchini, eggplant, peppers, tomatoes and even corn. Then try the likes of winter squash, brussels sprouts and mushrooms in fall; cabbage, onions and other root vegetables in winter, and saut\u00e9ed greens and asparagus in spring.\nIf you\u2019re planning ahead, you can make the dough up to five days in advance and roast the vegetables the day before (store them in the refrigerator). But do try to bake these on the same day as serving. They are at their best still warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/20/dining/20appetite1/20appetite1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "appetizer, cheddar, cherry tomatoes, zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 189}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 318, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "357 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/170 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/65 grams whole wheat flour", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/2 sticks/12 tablespoons/170 grams cold unsalted butter, cubed", "3/4 cup/55 grams sharp Cheddar, grated", "1 large egg, whisked", "3 medium zucchini, about 2 pounds, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 cups halved cherry tomatoes", "2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, more as needed", "1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 tablespoons hot honey (see note), more for drizzling if you like", "1 tablespoon tarragon vinegar or white wine vinegar", "3/4 cup fresh ricotta", "1 large egg", "3 tablespoons chopped chives", "1 small garlic clove, grated", "1/8 teaspoon black pepper", "2 to 3 tablespoons heavy cream or milk, for brushing the tops", "6 tablespoons finely grated Cheddar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together flours and salt.
