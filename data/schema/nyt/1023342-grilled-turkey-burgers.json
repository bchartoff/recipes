Grated onion and barbecue sauce give the patties savoriness and provide additional moisture, so they don\u2019t dry out from the high heat of the grill. Coating the patties in a mixture of barbecue sauce and mayonnaise guarantees a seared and glazed exterior. If you\u2019d like to turn these into cheeseburgers, simply drape sliced cheese \u2014 preferably Cheddar or pepper Jack \u2014 over the patties in the last two minutes of grilling and cover the grill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/02/dining/AS-Grilled-turkey-burgers1/merlin_209335332_b700c807-291b-44db-8ecb-7a61222f7de4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, burgers, main course", "keywords": "barbecue sauce, ground turkey, mayonnaise, onion, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 297}, "recipeIngredient": ["Neutral oil (such as canola), for greasing", "1 medium yellow onion, peeled", "1 pound ground turkey", "1/4 cup store-bought or homemade barbecue sauce", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "Black pepper", "4 hamburger buns", "Toppings (such as shredded iceberg, sliced onion, tomato and pickles) and condiments (mayonnaise, barbecue sauce or mustard), as desired\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the grill to medium-high.
