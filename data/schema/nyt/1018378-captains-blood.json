I prefer my Captain\u2019s Blood on the tart side, but you can adjust the amount of sugar to make it as sweet or as sharp as you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/30/magazine/30captains-blood/30captains-blood-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "angostura bitters, falernum, jamaican rum", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 13}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 136, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounce Jamaican dark rum", "1/4 ounce falernum", "1 ounce fresh lime juice", "2 dashes Angostura bitters", "1/2 teaspoon superfine sugar (or more to taste)", "Lime wheel or wedge for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Shake liquid ingredients and sugar with ice, and strain into a chilled cocktail glass or coupe.
