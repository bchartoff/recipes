It was named after Luisa Tetrazzini, a famous Italian opera star at the turn of the 20th century.

It\u2019s unclear exactly how this particular dish came to be named after her \u2014 it was certainly meant as a compliment \u2014 but <a href=\"https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/spaghetti_tetrazzini/\">some accounts</a> say it was her own recipe. The optional curry powder isn\u2019t traditional, but it\u2019s delicious, and a little added flair seems in the spirit of Ms. Tetrazzini.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/15/dining/sd-Turkey-Tetrazzini/sd-Turkey-Tetrazzini-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, main course", "keywords": "fall, mushroom, spaghetti, thanksgiving leftover, turkey, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 462}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1 pound spaghetti or linguine", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 pound cremini mushrooms, any tough or dry stems discarded, sliced", "8 garlic cloves, chopped", "1/3 cup all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon mild curry powder (optional)", "1 cup dry white wine", "4 cups chicken or turkey stock or broth", "8 ounces cream cheese, cut into chunks", "3 cups shredded or chopped leftover cooked turkey or chicken", "1 cup frozen peas", "1 heaping cup grated Parmesan (4 ounces)", "1 cup shredded or grated fontina (4 ounces)", "Black pepper", "1 cup panko bread crumbs", "1/2 cup slivered almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
