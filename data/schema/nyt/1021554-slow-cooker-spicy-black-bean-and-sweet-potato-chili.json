{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Spicy Black Bean and Sweet Potato Chili", "description": "This nourishing, smoky vegan chili is perfect for cold weeknights. Mix everything in the slow cooker before the chaos of the day begins, then just toss in some frozen corn a few minutes before you\u2019re ready to eat. As with any chili, toppings go far. Feel free to throw on what you have and what sounds good, like tortilla chips, cilantro or vegan cheese. The recipe calls for either coconut oil or vegetable oil. If you\u2019d like a mild coconut flavor \u2014 which plays well with the orange juice in the chili \u2014 choose unrefined or virgin coconut oil. For a neutral flavor, choose refined coconut oil or any vegetable oil. Use one chipotle chile for a very mild chili, and four if you like yours very spicy.
