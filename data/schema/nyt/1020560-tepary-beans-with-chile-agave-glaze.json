{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tepary Beans With Chile-Agave Glaze", "description": "The small tepary beans that grow in the harsh, dry American Southwest are an heirloom variety that has been cultivated and harvested wild by countless generations of Native people in the region. The Din\u00e9 (more commonly known as the Navajo) seed savers even protected them during <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/332.html\">the Long Walk of 1864</a>, a brutal forced march to eastern New Mexico, hiding the beans in their clothing. This is an amazing bean that can withstand and even prosper in the most extreme heat and drought. The white variety I use here is slightly sweet and nutty, while the brown variety has an earthier flavor. The combination of white and brown tepary beans is both visual and flavorful, but you could also simply use 2 cups of one variety of tepary bean. Top the beans with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020558-roasted-turnips-and-winter-squash-with-agave-glaze\">roasted turnips and winter squash</a> for a satisfying vegan meal, or pair them with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020557-bison-pot-roast-with-hominy\">bison pot roast</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020559-roast-turkey-with-berry-mint-sauce-and-black-walnuts\">roast turkey</a> or other meat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sean Sherman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/06/dining/04NativeAmericanrex4/04NativeAmericanrex4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 entree servings or 8 side servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans", "keywords": "fall, winter, hatch chile powder, light agave syrup, tepary beans, main course, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 16}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried white tepary beans (see Note)", "1 cup dried brown tepary beans (see Note)", "1 tablespoon sunflower oil", "1/2 small yellow onion, thinly sliced", "3 tablespoons light agave nectar", "1 tablespoon New Mexico Hatch chile powder or chipotle powder, plus more for garnish", "Sea salt", "2 teaspoons whole fresh oregano leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the white and brown tepary beans in a large bowl.
