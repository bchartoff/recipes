It\u2019s a meeting of sorts, between arguably Britain and America\u2019s greatest desserts: the treacle tart and pecan pie. Cut corners by grating the crust instead of rolling it out, but don\u2019t skip making your own bread crumbs and roasted walnuts; the texture and flavor rely on the freshness of both. Once you\u2019ve prebaked the crust to biscuit brown, err on the side of undercooking the molasses-custard filling: It\u2019ll firm up when cooled and stay gooey for days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clare de Boer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/dining/15pierex1/merlin_164213604_75507645-490a-45d1-96c9-ebaf62dcb8cf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie (about 10 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "american, british", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "bread, corn syrup, ginger, molasses, orange, walnut, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 16}, "recipeIngredient": ["Shortcut Pie Crust (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020632-shortcut-pie-crust\">see recipe</a>)", "4 1/2 ounces/130 grams whole raw, unsalted walnuts (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon/255 milliliters light corn syrup", "Zest of 1/2 navel orange (about 1 teaspoon) and 1/4 cup juice (from the whole orange)", "1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 ounces/85 grams crustless white bread (crusts removed or reserved for another use), torn into small pieces, then pulsed in a food processor until very fine (about 2 lightly packed cups)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream, plus more for serving", "1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020632\">Shortcut Pie Crust</a> through Step 3."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Once the dough has chilled, working over a 9-inch pie dish, prepare the crust through Step 4, then chill, at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days.
