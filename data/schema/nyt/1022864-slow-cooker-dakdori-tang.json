{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Dakdori Tang", "description": "Dakdori tang, sometimes called dakbokkeum-tang, is a homey Korean chicken stew that adapts beautifully to the slow cooker. Most traditional recipes combine the ingredients in a pot and let them bubble, with no saut\u00e9 step \u2014 similar to a one-pot, slow-cooker braise. Here, the dish is cooked on high, and the heat caramelizes the gochujang, a fermented red chile paste. The use of skin-on chicken is customary, and results in a rich broth with a layer of very delicious spiced chicken fat. If you prefer a leaner broth, you can remove the skin from some or all of the chicken parts before starting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/04/dining/sd-slow-cooker-dakdori-tang/merlin_195254376_01aac3af-d0a1-42a3-980d-8501af78a8c1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H10M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "chicken, gochujang, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 332}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes (about 2 large potatoes), scrubbed and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "1 pound carrots (about 4 large carrots), peeled and sliced into 1 to 1 1/2-inch chunks\u00a0", "10 garlic cloves, smashed and roughly chopped", "1 yellow or red onion, roughly chopped", "1 long green Korean chile (cheong-gochu), stemmed and thickly sliced, (or 1 jalape\u00f1o, stemmed, seeded and thickly sliced)", "1/2 cup gochujang\u00a0", "1/4 cup soy sauce\u00a0", "3 tablespoons gochugaru (see Tip)", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger (from about 2 inches ginger root)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons sesame oil\u00a0", "3 1/4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken drumsticks, thighs, or a combination (about 8 to 12 pieces)", "Cooked rice, for serving", "4 scallions, sliced", "Sesame seeds, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker combine the potatoes, carrots, garlic, onion, green chile, gochujang, soy sauce, gochugaru, ginger, sugar and sesame oil.
