{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turnip Gratin", "description": "A turnip gratin can be a rich, creamy affair, but this lighter version made with low-fat milk is equally delicious and comforting. When you use low-fat milk for a gratin, you will find quite a bit of liquid in the pan when you pull the dish from the oven. Let it sit for 20 to 30 minutes and the turnips will reabsorb the moisture. If any liquid remains in the dish, it\u2019s delicious spooned over the gratin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/03/science/06recipehealth/06recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "gluten-free, healthy, nut-free, vegetarian, gruy\u00e8re, low-fat milk, turnip, side dish, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 154}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "966 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter or olive oil for the baking dish", "1 garlic clove, cut in half", "2 pounds turnips, preferably small ones, peeled and sliced in thin rounds", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "4 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated (about 1 cup tightly packed)", "2 1/2 cups low-fat milk (1 percent or 2 percent)", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
