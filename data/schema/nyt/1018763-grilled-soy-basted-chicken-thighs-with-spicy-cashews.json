{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Soy-Basted Chicken Thighs With Spicy Cashews", "description": "Here's a hack I performed on a recipe for an appetizer portion of skewered chunked chicken thighs that the great live-fire cooks and cookbook writers Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby wrote many years ago, and that I have slowly altered into a main-course grilled dinner. The skinless chicken browns nicely over a medium flame, and the sugary soy basting sauce lacquers it beautifully in the final few minutes of cooking. It's terrific with rice, or as a topping for a salad of sturdy greens. You may wish to double the recipe for sriracha-roasted cashews. Those are addictive, and for them you will find many delicious uses.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/14/dining/24GRILLS4/14GRILLS4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, barbecues, poultry", "keywords": "brown sugar, cashew, chicken thighs, soy sauce, sriracha, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1282}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup unsalted cashews", "2 tablespoons sriracha sauce", "3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons hoisin sauce", "1 tablespoon cracked black pepper", "Hot sauce, to taste", "2 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs", "1/4 cup brown sugar (light or dark) or molasses", "2 tablespoons peeled and minced ginger", "4 scallions, sliced thin", "5 or 6 springs cilantro, tough stems removed and roughly chopped (approximately 2 tablespoons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees.
