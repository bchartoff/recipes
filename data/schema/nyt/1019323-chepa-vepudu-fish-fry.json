{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chepa Vepudu (Fish Fry)", "description": "As the Indian cookbook author Archana Pidathala worked to translate and rewrite her grandmother\u2019s collection of recipes from Andhra, in southeastern India, one of the first dishes she mastered was chepa vepudu, a simple fish fry. In Kurnool, where Pidathala grew up, her family would eat the spicy, crisp fish dish when there was a fresh catch of murrel available, also called bull's-eye snakehead, a delicious freshwater fish. But almost any fish, cut perpendicular to the spine, into small steaks, will do nicely. Marinated quickly in a simple spice paste, and shallow-fried, the fish becomes golden and crisp all over, and takes on the flavors of caramelized ginger and garlic, browned coriander seeds and red chile. Be sure to use a nonstick pan, or a well-seasoned cast-iron pan, to keep the fish from sticking or the marinade from falling off.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/20/magazine/20Eat/20Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "seafood, main course", "keywords": "fish, garlic, ginger, turmeric", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 537}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 347, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "489 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large garlic cloves, peeled", "1 2-inch piece ginger, peeled and roughly\u00a0sliced", "1 teaspoon red-chile powder", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon turmeric", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 tablespoon lime juice", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour, rice flour or\u00a0semolina", "2 pounds fish steaks, such as bass, haddock, mackerel or swordfish, cut into\u00a0about 6 1-inch-thick slices", "6 tablespoons neutral oil", "1 lime, cut into wedges", "1 handful cilantro sprigs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a mortar and pestle or a food processor, grind the garlic and ginger into a smooth paste, using a splash of water if necessary to catch the blade.
