{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tarte Flamb\u00e9e", "description": "Traditionally, this onion and bacon tart was a baker\u2019s treat made from dough scraps leftover from bread baking. The scraps were rolled out, topped with raw onion, bacon and fromage blanc (a soft, yogurtlike cheese) and baked until the dough puffed and the onions singed at the edges. Now you\u2019re as likely to find this savory tart at a restaurant or coming straight from someone\u2019s kitchen as at a bakery. This version, adapted from the chef Gabriel Kreuther, uses a biscuitlike crust made with baking powder instead of the usual yeasted dough. Since you don\u2019t have to let the dough rise, you can have a tarte flamb\u00e9e on the table in under 45 minutes. Serve this as an appetizer, a light main course, or for an unusual brunch offering.
