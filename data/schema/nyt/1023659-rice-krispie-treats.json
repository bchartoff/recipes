{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Krispie Treats", "description": "These classic treats are salty-sweet and the perfect balance of crispy, gooey, soft and chewy. This version, inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11587-caramelized-brown-butter-rice-krispies-treats\">the one Julia Moskin adapted from the chef Colin Alevras</a> for The Times in 2007, is also enhanced by deeply browned butter. But here, a good amount of salt balances out the sweetness and includes a secret to achieving the perfect texture: the marshmallows are cooked gently to prevent the sugars from caramelizing, which can turn your treats hard and dry. You can easily double this recipe, and use a 9-by-13 pan, but you\u2019ll end up with slightly taller treats (which is not a bad thing). The rainbow sprinkles are optional, but highly recommended.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Scott Loitsch"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/12/multimedia/sl-rice-krispies-treats-1-a552/sl-rice-krispies-treats-1-a552-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, dessert", "keywords": "cookies and bars, make-ahead, unsalted butter, vanilla extract", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 345}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, preferably European-style, plus extra for greasing", "1 (12-ounce/340-gram) bag marshmallows (preferably standard size)", "1 1/4 teaspoons/5 grams kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "6 cups/180 grams Rice Krispies cereal", "Rainbow sprinkles (optional, but highly recommended)", "Flaky salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butter a 9-inch square baking pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat until it starts to foam, about 3 minutes.
