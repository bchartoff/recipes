{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Paillard With Black Olive Tapenade", "description": "Paillard is the French word for a thin slice of meat that cooks quickly. (Sometimes, a thicker piece of meat is pounded with a mallet to make it thinner.) This recipe is an easy way to make a chicken paillard without much pounding. Essentially, you butterfly a boneless, skinless chicken breast, slicing horizontally to make a flat, heart-shaped breast, then pound it lightly. Unfortunately, a chicken breast is often dry and tasteless, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Seasoned and cooked correctly, it should be tasty and moist. A dab of tapenade, a traditional Proven\u00e7al black olive paste, makes a perfect accompaniment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/dining/29kitchrex1/merlin_152372379_fc23c1f9-9852-485b-92de-2a69904e4558-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "anchovies, arugula, capers, chicken breast, lemon, olives, parmesan, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 238}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 635, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "43 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "56 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "759 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup pitted Ni\u00e7oise olives", "4 anchovy fillets", "3 garlic cloves, grated", "1 tablespoon capers, well rinsed", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley", "1/2 teaspoon orange zest", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 8 ounces each", "Salt and pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped thyme, plus a few sprigs", "8 wide strips of lemon zest, from 1 medium lemon", "5 ounces wild arugula (about 4 handfuls)", "A piece of Parmigiano-Reggiano or pecorino Romano, for shaving", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the tapenade: In the bowl of a food processor, place olives, anchovy, garlic, capers, parsley, orange zest, lemon zest, red-pepper flakes and olive oil.
