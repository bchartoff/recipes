{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi Cheddar Biscuits", "description": "Regardless of where, or even when, you\u2019re eating a biscuit, the formula\u2019s the same: a little flour, a little water, frozen butter. A pair of deft, knowing hands and an oven to bring them home. A biscuit can be a side dish of little note, or it can characterize an entire place and time, etching its own corner in your memory. The acidity and crunch of ripe kimchi meld deeply with Cheddar here, and also in versions from Kay Chun and Joy Cho, resulting in a biscuit that traverses multiple flavors from bite to bite. For the best results, chill your butter in the freezer and your buttermilk in the refrigerator for at least an hour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Bryan Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/10/dining/10EAT-kimchi-cheddar-biscuits-1/merlin_209070054_633dc2f9-cf89-4b45-b6f0-e288dc321219-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "6 biscuits", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "biscuit, buttermilk, cheddar, kimchi", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 351}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/145 grams drained kimchi, finely chopped", "2 cups/258 grams all-purpose flour (see Tip)", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "2 tablespoons brown sugar", "3/4 cup/66 grams shredded sharp Cheddar", "6 tablespoons/85 grams cold unsalted butter, plus more for baking sheet", "1 cup/240 milliliters cold buttermilk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir-fry the chopped kimchi in a stainless-steel pan over medium heat until the juices have evaporated and the kimchi smells even more fragrant, about 3 minutes.
