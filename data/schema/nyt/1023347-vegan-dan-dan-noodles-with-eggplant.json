Cutting the eggplant into relatively chunky pieces and covering the pot with a lid while cooking is the key to achieving the right texture: It locks in moisture, ensures that the pieces don\u2019t fall apart, and allows the flesh to become tender and smoky. Once tossed with the noodles and sauce, the eggplant breaks up and becomes creamy. If you don\u2019t have tahini, you can substitute it with smooth peanut butter or almond butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/20/dining/hm-vegetarian-dandan-noodles/merlin_209335521_89c2d137-7088-4f6d-a2e1-bdbebdcceb77-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "egg, tahini, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 585}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons soy sauce", "3 tablespoons black or rice vinegar", "1/4 cup tahini (or Chinese/Japanese sesame paste)", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated or chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated or chopped (about 1 tablespoon)", "2 to 3 tablespoons chile oil, chile crisp or doubanjiang", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 large eggplant (about 1\u00bc pounds), trimmed", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "12 ounces dried thin wheat noodles (see Tip)", "Neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "Black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorns (optional)", "2 scallions, white and green parts separated and finely sliced", "A generous pinch of granulated sugar", "Handful of cilantro leaves", "1 cup dry, unsalted roasted peanuts, roughly chopped", "Chile oil or chile crisp, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Combine the soy sauce, black or rice vinegar, tahini, garlic, ginger, chile oil and granulated sugar in a bowl, and whisk to combine.
