{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soft-Shell Crab Toast", "description": "Broiling is perhaps the easiest way to cook soft shell crabs. All you do is oil up the crabs, lay them on a baking sheet and broil them until crisp and bronzed on both sides \u2014 under 10 minutes. It's also one of the tastiest ways to cook them: their edges crisp and char while their bellies swell with sweet, saline juices. Here, the broiled crabs are laid on toast and served as open-faced sandwiches. The toast absorbs the crab juices and also heightens the crunch. If you're pressed for time, or if you're a purist, you can skip the parsley jalape\u00f1o sauce. A lemon wedge is all you really need to bring out the sweetness of the crab.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/19/multimedia/clark-crab-toasts/clark-crab-toasts-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 appetizer servings, or 3 main course servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, jalape\u00f1o, soft-shell crab, toast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 56}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 322, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "408 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups packed Italian parsley leaves", "2 jalape\u00f1o peppers, seeded and coarsely chopped", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon salt, more as needed", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "6  (1/2-inch-thick) slices country-style bread or pain de mie", "1 large garlic clove, halved and peeled", "Unsalted butter, as needed (optional)", "6  (3-ounce) wild jumbo soft-shelled crabs, cleaned", "Black pepper, as needed", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a blender, combine parsley, jalape\u00f1o, lemon juice and salt.
