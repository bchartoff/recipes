The key to achieving perfectly crisp \u201cfries\u201d is heating your sheet pan in a 500-degree oven for a good 10 minutes. When you toss the potatoes onto the blisteringly hot pan, magic happens: The potatoes sear and develop a truly crunchy crust. In terms of seasoning, we keep it simple with just salt and pepper, but feel free to experiment with adding a bit of chili or garlic powder, smoked paprika or cayenne to the mix.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/07/dining/07COOKING-BAKEDFRENCHFRIES/07COOKING-BAKEDFRENCHFRIES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, belgian", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 230}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 255, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "300 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes (about 3 large), cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick sticks", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange one oven rack at the lowest point.
