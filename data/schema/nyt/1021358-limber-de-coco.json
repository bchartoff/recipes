Lindbergh, who landed on the island in 1928.

In New York, this simple dessert may be one of the best things about summers in the Bronx. Serve it in cups \u2014 squeeze the cups, take your first lick, then turn the dessert upside-down \u2014 or as ice cubes. The cubes are especially nice in coconut-flavored rum after a long day.
