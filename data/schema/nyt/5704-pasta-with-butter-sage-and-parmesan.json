{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Butter, Sage And Parmesan", "description": "Like many simple sauces, this one takes less time to prepare than the pasta itself. Fresh, fragrant sage is my choice of herb here, but substitutions abound. Try parsley, thyme, chervil or other green herbs in its place. Or cook minced shallot or onion in the butter until translucent. You may even toast bread crumbs or chopped nuts in the butter, just until they're lightly browned. In any case, finish the sauce with a sprinkling of Parmesan, which not only adds its distinctive sharpness, but also thickens the mixture even further.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/03/dining/03COOKING-PASTAWITHBUTTER2/03COOKING-PASTAWITHBUTTER2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "quick, pastas", "keywords": "butter, parmigiano-reggiano, ziti", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 494}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 607, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "90 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "397 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound cut pasta, like ziti", "2 tablespoons butter", "30 fresh sage leaves", "1 cup or more freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil; salt it.
