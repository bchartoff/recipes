{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Sheet Cake With Molasses Cream-Cheese Frosting", "description": "This simple, warmly spiced pumpkin cake is enough to feed a crowd, making it a perfect holiday treat. It's also relatively versatile: You can serve it in the pan for an easy presentation, or transfer it to a platter for something a little more refined. The frosting is just enough to coat the cake in a thin layer, but, if you want more, you may want to more for a generous coating. And, for a more subtly flavored frosting, substitute an equal amount of dark maple syrup for the molasses, or skip the molasses entirely for pure cream-cheese flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/dining/10COOKING-PUMPKINCAKE1/10COOKING-PUMPKINCAKE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "One 9x13-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cinnamon, ginger, molasses, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 519}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter\u00a0(1 stick), softened but cool, plus more for the pan", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons ginger", "2 teaspoons cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 1/2 cups/330 grams light brown sugar, firmly packed", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters grapeseed or other neutral-flavored oil", "2 large eggs", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 (15-ounce/425-gram)\u00a0can pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "1/2 cup/4 ounces/113 grams cream cheese, softened but cool", "1/4 cup/57 grams unsalted butter, softened but cool", "2 cups/226 grams confectioners' sugar, sifted", "1 tablespoon molasses", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
