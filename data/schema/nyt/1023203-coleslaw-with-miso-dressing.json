This recipe makes a generous amount of dressing so that you can dress the slaw to your liking. Start by tossing the cabbage with half the miso mixture, then add more until it's dressed to your idea of perfection. Whatever you don\u2019t use can be tossed with other salad greens, drizzled over rice, or used as a dip for crunchy cucumbers, snap peas or carrots.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/25/dining/dp-cole-slaw-with-miso-dressing/merlin_206068122_84f158f7-1f44-47b5-b3e4-a868a658693f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "miso, peanut, red cabbage, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 404}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup rice vinegar", "1/3 cup vegetable or other neutral oil\u00a0", "2 tablespoons yellow or red miso", "2 tablespoons honey", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "Black pepper", "1 1/4 pounds red cabbage (about 1/2 large head), cored and thinly sliced (about 6 cups)\u00a0", "1 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1/2 cup roasted, salted peanuts\u00a0", "1 tablespoon lime juice\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, miso and honey.
