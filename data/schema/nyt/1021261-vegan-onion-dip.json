There is some down time in this recipe \u2014 soaking the cashews and letting the dip rest \u2014 but don\u2019t be tempted to skip those steps. The cashews need to soak so they blend as smoothly as possible, and the finished dip benefits greatly from some time to let the flavors come together. Prepare it a day in advance and refrigerate overnight for best results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/dining/ya-vegan-onion-dip/ya-vegan-onion-dip-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings (about 3 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, condiments, dips and spreads, finger foods, appetizer", "keywords": "cannellini beans, cashew, onion, white beans, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 888}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup raw cashews (about 4 ounces)", "3 cups chopped yellow onions (from 2 medium onions)", "1/4 cup olive oil", "Kosher salt and coarse black pepper", "1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained (about 1 cup)", "4 teaspoons lemon juice, plus more as needed", "4 teaspoons apple cider vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika", "Chopped chives, for garnish (optional)", "Potato chips or crudit\u00e9s, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the cashews to a bowl and cover with water.
