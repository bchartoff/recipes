{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arugula Pesto", "description": "To most people, pesto means one thing: pesto Genovese, the famous and fabulous basil paste from the Italian Riviera.  But there are sauces made with copious amounts of other herbs or greens not destined for pasta. They aren\u2019t called pestos, yet that\u2019s what they are \u2014 all made by grinding herbs and other ingredients to a paste, then thinning out and enriching with oil. This dish is inspired by one found in southern Italy. This sauce, like other forms of pesto, is all pungent with garlic. In addition to serving this vibrant pesto with pasta, it can be used with grains \u2014 risottos made with rice, barley, or wheat \u2014 and as a topping for tomatoes. It\u2019s great on its own, spooned onto a thick slice of country bread. Don\u2019t use a sharp olive oil with this, or it will overwhelm the arugula.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/08/31/health/31recipehealth_600/31recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Makes about 2/3 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, condiments", "keywords": "healthy, raw, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 237}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 851, "unsaturatedFatContent": "67 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "86 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "511 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 garlic cloves, cut in half, green shoots removed", "2 heaped tablespoons shelled walnuts", "4 ounces arugula, stemmed, washed and dried 2 cups leaves, tightly packed", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/3 to 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, as needed", "1/3 to 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn on a food processor fitted with the steel blade, and drop in the garlic cloves.
