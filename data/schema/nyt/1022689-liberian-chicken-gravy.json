{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Liberian Chicken Gravy", "description": "A staple of Liberian cuisine, this chicken tastes complex with its mix of spicy heat and richness, but comes together simply in just one pan. For the chef Thalmus Hare and other Liberians, this dish is part of the Thanksgiving table. (Liberia is one of the only countries outside the United States to celebrate Thanksgiving.) Peppers are staples in Liberian cuisine, and this recipe incorporates two kinds: sweet red bell peppers and more fiery habaneros. They\u2019re a satisfying counterbalance to the intense chicken flavor that\u2019s supercharged by both broth and Maggi seasoning. This shares similarities with Liberian pepper chicken, another popular dish, but is much saucier.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/10/dining/08liberian-thanksgiving-rex1/08liberian-thanksgiving-rex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, haba\u00f1ero, tomato paste, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 304}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1/4 teaspoon onion powder", "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 4)\u00a0", "1 large yellow onion, roughly chopped", "2 garlic cloves", "1 chicken-flavored bouillon seasoning cube, such as Maggi", "2 habanero peppers, stems removed\u00a0", "1 tablespoon olive oil\u00a0", "1/4 cup tomato paste\u00a0", "1 cup unsalted chicken stock, homemade or store-bought\u00a0", "1 red bell pepper, very thinly sliced", "Cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, mix together seasoned salt, black pepper, cayenne, onion powder and garlic powder.
