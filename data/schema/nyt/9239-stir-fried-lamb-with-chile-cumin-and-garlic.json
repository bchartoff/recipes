You can use loin if you prefer, but the dish will cost at least 10 times as much and it won\u2019t be any better. Marinate it dry (or nearly so; I use a little soy sauce, for complexity) for as long as you like \u2014 10 minutes, an hour, a day. The flavor will get a little stronger, though not much.\n\nMore important than the length of time is the freshness of your cumin. You absolutely need cumin seeds, not ground cumin. It\u2019s worth the two or three minutes it takes to toast the seeds before marinating the meat. You can grind them if you like, but I like the little bit of crunch the seeds add.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "cumin, lamb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 51}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds lamb shoulder", "1 tablespoon cumin seeds", "1/2 teaspoon crushed red chile flakes, or to taste", "1 tablespoon chopped garlic", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Peanut or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn, to film the bottom of the skillet", "1 cup trimmed and roughly chopped scallions, optional", "Chopped fresh cilantro leaves for garnish, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut lamb into 1/2-inch cubes (easier if meat is firmed in the freezer for 15 to 45 minutes).
