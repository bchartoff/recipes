Cumin, chile and Sichuan peppercorns are used generously, resulting in bold, not-for-the-faint-of-heart dishes that combine Chinese and Middle Eastern flavors. This recipe, which is adapted from \u201cTo Asia, With Love\u201d by Hetty McKinnon, is a vegan riff on the signature lamb dish at Xi\u2019an Famous Foods, a restaurant chain in New York, that is made with chunks of meat dry-fried in a heavy cumin spice mix.
