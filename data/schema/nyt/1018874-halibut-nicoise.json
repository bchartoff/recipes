Erin French, the chef at the Lost Kitchen in Freedom, Me., does just that with her Maine halibut ni\u00e7oise, in which the main components of a classic ni\u00e7oise are accounted for, but totally reconfigured. Beans and new potatoes are in a simple shallot dressing; eggs are poached so the yolks are still soft and runny; garlic and anchovies season a quick tapenade. If your cast-iron pan fits only two fillets comfortably, cook the fish in two batches to avoid overcrowding.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/02/dining/02ERINREX1/02ERIN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, seafood", "keywords": "egg, halibut, lettuce, olives, potato, tomato, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 146}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 594, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1361 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt, as needed", "1/2 pound green beans, trimmed", "1 pound baby or new potatoes", "1/2 cup mixed kalamata and green olives, pitted and finely chopped", "1 anchovy fillet, finely chopped", "1 garlic clove, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots", "2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "Ground black pepper, as needed", "1 large ripe heirloom tomato, cut into 8 wedges", "4 eggs", "4 halibut fillets (about 1/2 pound each)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 head bibb lettuce, leaves separated, washed and torn into bite-size pieces", "1 lemon, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large pot with water, season generously with salt, and bring to a boil.
