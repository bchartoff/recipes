{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta e Ceci (Italian Pasta and Chickpea Stew)", "description": "There is an incredible number of recipes for this classic Roman dish, and everyone has an opinion on how it should be prepared. This version is more stew than soup, but it can be loosened up with a bit more water if you prefer. It begins with saut\u00e9ing onion, tomatoes, garlic and rosemary in olive oil, then tossing in the chickpeas, and smashing a few to give the stew a creamy texture. Water is added, then uncooked pasta, which cooks as the stew simmers (and results in one less dish for you wash). Escarole is folded in right before serving. This flexible stew can go in a number of directions, so tweak it as you see fit, but don\u2019t forget to finish each bowl with grated pecorino and a drizzle of olive oil.
