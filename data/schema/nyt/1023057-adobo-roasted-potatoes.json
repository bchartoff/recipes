{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Adobo Roasted Potatoes", "description": "Using a classic Puerto Rican adobo seasoning \u2014 an island staple blend of garlic powder, oregano and black pepper \u2014 this recipe yields simple, savory roasted potatoes. They pair well with grilled meat and seafood, or make for a flavorful addition to any vegetable plate. The seasoning mix can be doubled or tripled (or more), with the rest stored in the pantry as an all-purpose seasoning, as it\u2019s often used in Puerto Rican cooking to add instant flavor to stewed meats, beans and more. Roasted potatoes will keep for at least a week in the fridge, so make a big batch to snack on, add them to salads and soups, or smash and fry them for breakfast home fries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/29/dining/vd-adobo-roasted-potatoes/merlin_204710316_564402af-52be-4e07-a653-1cf5a42f0a08-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "adobo seasoning, potato, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 172}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "2 teaspoons garlic powder", "1/4 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds whole baby new potatoes, scrubbed and dried well", "3 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and line a medium rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the adobo seasoning: In a small bowl, combine 1\u00bd teaspoons salt with the garlic powder, oregano, turmeric and pepper, and mix well with a fork."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put potatoes in a large bowl and randomly poke a few small holes in each with a fork.
