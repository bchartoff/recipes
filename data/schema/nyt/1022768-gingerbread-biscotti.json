{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gingerbread Biscotti", "description": "Have a hot cup of coffee ready for dipping these spiced, crunchy biscotti. Like most Tuscan biscotti, these include no fat, which makes for an extra-dry cookie. That means it saturates quickly when dunked, turning it into something like silken cake while also sweetening your coffee. Pops of chewy candied ginger and a slick of dark chocolate make this biscotti a little more special. And while the ingredient list may be longer than some, each item builds upon the last, creating a symphony of warming flavors and smells. To help keep track of the many spices while assembling your ingredients, measure them into small piles on a dinner plate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08COOKIES7-gingerbread-biscotti/merlin_198248850_1a09bdb6-7688-41cc-b99c-8a30f90adbfe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "1 dozen\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "christmas cookie, dark chocolate, espresso powder, ground ginger, semisweet chocolate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 609}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large egg plus 1 large egg white, at room temperature\u00a0", "2/3 packed cup/150 grams light brown sugar", "1/3 cup/70 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon ground ginger\u00a0", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom\u00a0", "1 whole star anise, finely ground (1/4 teaspoon)", "1 teaspoon instant espresso powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon almond extract", "1/4 teaspoon lemon extract", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour\u00a0", "1/4 cup/35 grams diced (1/4-inch) crystallized ginger\u00a0", "2/3 cup/113 grams dark or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped (4 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the egg, egg white, both sugars, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom, star anise, espresso powder, salt, baking soda, almond extract and lemon extract.
