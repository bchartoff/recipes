{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry Lattice Pie", "description": "Here's a showstopper of a summer pie if there ever was one. In this recipe that came to The Times in 1995, a generous pile of blueberries is tossed with sugar, cinnamon and orange zest then baked in a butter-shortening crust until the filling is bubbly and the crust golden brown. Don't be intimidated by the lattice top. Just take your time, and do your best. No matter what it looks like, it'll taste delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/11/dining/BLUEBERRYPIE/BLUEBERRYPIE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, blueberries, sugar, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 199}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 472, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "475 milligrams", "sugarContent": "28 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons plus 2 tablespoons sugar", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut in small pieces", "6 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening", "6 to 8 tablespoons ice water", "1 egg, beaten with 1 teaspoon water", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon grated orange zest", "6 cups fresh blueberries, cleaned"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the crust, combine the flour, 2 teaspoons of sugar and salt in a large bowl.
