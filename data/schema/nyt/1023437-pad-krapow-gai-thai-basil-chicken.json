While this popular Thai street food can be whipped up using a range of proteins, Mr. Yenbamroong refers to his riff as \u201clow-rent\u201d because it\u2019s prepared with ground chicken rather than pricier slices of meat. It\u2019s piled with basil; Thai basil or holy basil provide more assertive licorice notes, but sweet basil adds herbal bursts of brightness. Spiked with Thai seasoning (see Tip), the chicken mixture is salty on its own, but it\u2019s inextricably linked with rice, and imparts the right amount of salinity when dispersed.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/29/dining/aw-pad-grapow-gai-1/merlin_212088519_ef79d3f5-7496-448a-8cf4-009939701ed4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, quick, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "basil, chile, fish sauce, green beans, ground chicken, oyster sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2010}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1 pound ground chicken (preferably dark meat)", "2 teaspoons minced garlic (from 2 cloves)", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon minced fresh bird\u2019s-eye chile or other fresh chile (from 1 chile)", "8 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 1/2 cups)", "3 tablespoons oyster sauce", "2 tablespoons fish sauce", "1 tablespoon Thai seasoning sauce (such as Golden Mountain; see Tip)", "1 cup loosely packed basil leaves (preferably Thai basil or holy basil)", "Ground white pepper, to taste", "Steamed jasmine rice, for serving", "4 crispy fried eggs (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over medium-high, then swirl in the oil.
