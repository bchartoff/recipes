{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Lentil Soup With Sausage and Greens", "description": "The seasonings in Italian sausage \u2014 fennel, red pepper, garlic \u2014 pair beautifully with lentils, and here, they make for a punchy take on lentil soup. The sausage's flavors are reinforced by adding more garlic and pepper to the soup itself, for pops of flavor. Pleasantly firm but creamy on the inside, Beluga lentils (also known as black lentils) are worth seeking out for this hearty soup because they hold their shape when cooked, adding a lovely texture. But you can absolutely use regular green or brown lentils instead. Just know that they will fall apart, making the soup smoother. This recipe freezes well and is better after it rests in the refrigerator, so make a big batch to eat for days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/dining/sd-sausage-lentil/sd-sausage-lentil-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "fall, spring, winter, garlic powder, Italian sausage, lentils, onion powder, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1247}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 694, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1435 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound hot or sweet Italian pork sausage, loose or removed from its casing", "Olive oil, if necessary", "1 large red or yellow onion, chopped", "Kosher salt", "6 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "3 thyme\u00a0sprigs", "2 oregano sprigs, leaves only, or 1 teaspoon dried oregano", "Generous pinch of red-pepper flakes", "Freshly ground black pepper", "3/4 cup dry white wine", "1 bay leaf", "2 cups dried lentils, preferably black beluga", "1 (14-ounce) can whole\u00a0or chopped\u00a0tomatoes", "8 cups chicken stock", "5 ounces greens, such as baby spinach or kale, or 1 medium bunch greens, such as chard or kale, stemmed and chopped", "1 tablespoon red-wine vinegar", "Chopped fresh basil, for topping", "Grated Parmesan, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "\u00a0In a large, dry skillet over medium-high heat, cook the sausage, breaking it up with a spatula, until it is in small, coarse pieces, and starts to brown and sizzle in its own fat, about 8 minutes.
