{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dessert Galette Pastry", "description": "A galette is a free-form pie, more rustic than a tart, that is baked directly on a sheet pan or baking stone. Although they\u2019re usually made with classic buttery pie dough or puff pastry, I\u2019ve developed this yeasted dough recipe, which is delicate and tasty but not too rich. The yield is enough for two galettes, but has only 60 grams of butter (about four tablespoons). It\u2019s sort of a cross between a pizza dough and pie-crust dough, wholesome because of the addition of whole-wheat flour but not heavy. Almond flour contributes a nutty flavor and delicate texture, but it\u2019s optional. The trick is to roll it very thin, then freeze it right away so that it doesn\u2019t continue to rise and become too bready. Make sure to dust your work surface well before you roll out the pastry, and to let the dough rest for a few minutes after each few passes with the rolling pin so that it doesn\u2019t shrink back, as yeast doughs do. If you keep letting it rest, you won\u2019t have trouble achieving a thin 12- to 13-inch round.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/28/science/27recipehealth/27recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "Makes enough for 2 9 -inch galettes", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butter, flour, yeast, dessert, halal, healthy, kosher, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 91}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 821, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "122 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "627 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 grams (1 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast", "115 grams (1/2 cup) lukewarm water", "2 tablespoons plus 1/4 teaspoon sugar", "1 large egg, at room temperature, beaten", "135 grams (1 cup) whole-wheat flour", "155 grams (1 1/4 cups) unbleached flour", "25 grams (1/4 cup) almond flour (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "60 grams (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dissolve the yeast in the water.
