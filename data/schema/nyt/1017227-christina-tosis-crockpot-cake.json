Off the clock, though, her cooking runs to inspired simplicity, as in this simple, tangy, slightly-caramelized at the edges slow-cooker cake, a version of which appears in her cookbook from Clarkson Potter, \u201cMilk Bar Life.\u201d Slow-cooker recipes invariably tell you to make something at night and enjoy them in the morning, or to make them in the morning and eat them after work. That only works if you don\u2019t sleep much, or have a part-time job. This is a recipe for a weekend afternoon, or for cooking from the moment you get home until the very near end of a dinner party. It is a four-to-six hour affair.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/dining/18CROCKPOT2/18CROCKPOT2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, cakes", "keywords": "butter, cake flour, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 806}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 546, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "326 milligrams", "sugarContent": "38 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound/226 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/45 grams packed light brown sugar", "3 large eggs", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters buttermilk", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams cake flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put all but 1 tablespoon of the butter and the sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer and cream with the paddle attachment at medium-high speed, until the mixture is smooth and pale, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
