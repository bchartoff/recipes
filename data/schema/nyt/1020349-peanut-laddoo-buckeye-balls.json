It was dreamed up by Hetal Vasavada, the blogger and author of the dessert cookbook \u201cMilk & Cardamom,\u201d which combines the traditional Indian flavors she grew up with and the Western sweets she encountered as an American kid in New Jersey. The cardamom, ghee and jaggery provide both an interesting twist to the traditional flavor combination and a slightly grittier texture, which Ms. Vasavada likens to that of a Butterfinger candy bar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/16/dining/16burfirex-01/merlin_157887777_b8e434ca-3321-4fca-94a1-2e5501f899df-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "About 15 balls", "recipeCuisine": "american, indian", "recipeCategory": "snack, candies, cookies and bars", "keywords": "cardamom, coconut oil, ghee, milk chocolate, peanut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 130}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/150 grams roasted unsalted peanuts", "2/3 cup/95 grams jaggery powder or 145 grams dark brown sugar", "2 tablespoons/30 grams ghee, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon cardamom seeds, finely crushed", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/130 grams milk chocolate morsels", "1 teaspoon coconut oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium\u00a0skillet, toast the peanuts over medium heat, shaking the pan, until fragrant and slightly darkened, 3 to 4 minutes.
