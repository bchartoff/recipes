{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pure Potato Latkes", "description": "Perfect for Hanukkah or any time of year, these latkes bring out the pure flavor of potato, because that is basically the only ingredient in them. Making latkes can be a last-minute nightmare, with overeager cooks putting too many patties in hot oil, thus taking longer to fry and resulting in a greasy mess. But these can be prepared in advance. This recipe, adapted from the chef Nathaniel Wade of the <a href=\"https://www.outermostinn.com/\">Outermost Inn</a> on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, starts with parbaked potatoes, which are cooled, grated, seasoned with just salt and pepper, pressed into patties and refrigerated, then fried just before serving. You can either serve them with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream, smoked salmon and tiny flecks of chives, or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016867-brisket-in-sweet-and-sour-sauce\">traditional brisket</a> and homemade applesauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/16/dining/04latkerex/merlin_180333147_6a3d81ad-b056-4c35-b146-e1221f077e14-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 latkes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "fall, winter, hanukkah, plan-ahead, russet potatoes, smoked salmon, vegetable pancake", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2820}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large Idaho or russet potatoes, washed and dried", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Canola oil, for frying", "8 ounces sliced smoked salmon (optional)", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream, for serving (optional)", "Chopped fresh chives, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Adjust the rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350 degrees.
