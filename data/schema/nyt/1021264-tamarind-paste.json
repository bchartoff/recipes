{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tamarind Paste", "description": "Preparing tamarind paste is quite simple, and homemade paste has the added advantage of keeping for several months in the refrigerator, the result of its high acid content. Tamarind fruit comes in two forms: as blocks of fruit pulp or as whole fruit pods. If working with tamarind fruit pods, make sure they\u2019re unripe, which ensures a stronger degree of sourness and less sweetness. And don\u2019t forget to remove and discard the outer shell to use the pulp. Blocks of tamarind can be obtained from Indian and Asian grocery stores or online.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10Tamarindrex4-paste/10Tamarindrex4-paste-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "indian, thai, vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "tamarind, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 167}, "recipeIngredient": ["9 ounces tamarind fruit pulp (from a compressed block or from 15 to 20 shelled pods)", "1 1/2 cups boiling water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Separate the tamarind into small chunks and place the fruit into a medium heatproof bowl.
