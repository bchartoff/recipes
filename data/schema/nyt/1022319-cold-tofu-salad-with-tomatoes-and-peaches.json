{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cold Tofu Salad With Tomatoes and Peaches", "description": "Sweet, savory and refreshing for summer\u2019s hottest days, this is the salad to make when tomatoes and peaches are at their prime, on the verge of bursting. Inspired by Italian caprese salad and Japanese hiyayakko, it features juicy, ripe wedges of peaches and tomatoes seasoned with flaky salt, which draws out their juices to mingle with soy-balsamic dressing and creamy silken tofu. Top the salad with a shower of fragrant basil and mint, a nod to the shiso that often accompanies hiyayakko, and a few cranks of black pepper. Be sure to spoon the umami-rich dressing (the best part!) over the tomatoes, peaches and tofu so that it pools at the bottom of the serving platter.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a> newsletter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hana Asbrink"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/20/dining/ha-cold-tofu-salad/merlin_190839501_34d9e744-7e38-40db-a705-e4b49904d214-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "peach, tofu, tomato, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1031}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 to 14 ounces silken tofu, chilled", "2 to 3 ripe medium peaches", "3 to 4 ripe medium tomatoes", "Flaky sea salt", "1/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves", "2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves", "Black pepper", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar", "1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the tofu: Carefully drain the tofu in its packaging, then remove the tofu.
