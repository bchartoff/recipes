You\u2019ve fed it and watched it become bubbly and fragrant, with a light yeasty-boozy scent. Now it\u2019s time to bake bread. An easy way to start is with this adaptation of the baker Jim Lahey\u2019s storied recipe for <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread\">no-knead bread</a>, replacing commercial yeast with a little less than three-quarters of a cup of healthy, well-fed sourdough starter. Give the resulting dough a long, long rise and then plop it into a hot, enameled cast-iron pot with a lid. You\u2019ll have an incredible loaf within the hour, and may well find yourself addicted to the smell, the taste and the process alike.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/23/dining/23SOURDOUGH2/23SOURDOUGH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1D", "recipeYield": "1 loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "bread flour, sesame seeds, sourdough starter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 847}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 259, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "178 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 cups/425 grams bread flour", "1 teaspoon/6 grams kosher salt", "3/4 cup/180 grams <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013152-sourdough-starter\">sourdough starter</a>, \u201cfed\u201d", "2 tablespoons/9 grams sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small mixing bowl, stir together 300 grams (about 1 1/4 cups) lukewarm tap water with the sourdough starter, then pour the mixture into the bowl with the flour mixture.
