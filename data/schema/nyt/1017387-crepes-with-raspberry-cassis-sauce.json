The sauce, made by simmering raspberries in a rose-scented, cassis-spiked syrup, is what makes them special. While most of it is poured over the folded crepes, a bit is added to the yogurt, honey and lime filling, making it just sweet enough.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/06/dining/06MARTHA/06MARTHA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, pancakes", "keywords": "cr\u00e8me de cassis liqueur, raspberries, rose water, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 130}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 378, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "175 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters low-fat milk, such as skim or 1 percent", "2 large eggs", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 tablespoon/15 grams sugar", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/55 grams unbleached all-purpose flour, sifted", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/55 grams whole wheat flour or whole wheat pastry flour, sifted", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus butter for the pan", "1 teaspoon finely grated lime zest (from about 1/2 lime)", "1/4 cup sugar", "1/2 teaspoon rose water", "1 6-ounce box raspberries (about 1 1/4 cups)", "1 tablespoon cr\u00e8me de cassis liqueur", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters plain Greek yogurt (2 percent fat)", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon mild honey, such as clover or acacia (more to taste)", "1 1/4 teaspoons finely grated lime zest (from about 1/2 lime)", "1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lime juice (to taste)", "1 6-ounce box raspberries (about 1 1/4 cups)", "Powdered sugar for dusting (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make crepe batter, place milk, eggs, salt and sugar in blender.
