After he refused an officer\u2019s request to play a tune, Mr. Fanciulli was arrested for insubordination. But Fanciulli later had a cocktail named after him. The drink\u2019s origins are murky, but it is clearly in the manhattan family, the chief difference being a touch of the amaro Fernet Branca, perhaps a nod to the musician;'s childhood years in Italy. This recipe is from Philip Greene, a Washington-based cocktail historian.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/dining/09greenerex1/merlin_148844385_f7606274-8dbb-438c-8766-5ff0748f5028-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bourbon, fernet branca, sweet vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 17}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 181, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": null, "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "1 milligram", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces bourbon", "1 ounce sweet vermouth", "1/4 ounce Fernet Branca", "Lemon twist, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing glass half-filled with ice, combine the bourbon, vermouth and Fernet Branca.
