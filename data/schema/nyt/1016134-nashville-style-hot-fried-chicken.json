{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nashville-Style Hot Fried Chicken", "description": "This version of Nashville hot fried chicken, adapted from Peaches HotHouse in Brooklyn, will make your tongue sizzle and fill your eyes with tears from a combination of cayenne and ghost chile powders. (The latter is the hottest chile in the world, reaching 1,000,000 on the Scoville heat scale.) Note that the recipe calls for both granulated and powdered onion and garlic. Try to use both. The powdered stuff is stronger in flavor while the granulated has a little more texture to it. (However if you can\u2019t find both, either kind will work throughout the recipe.) The traditional way to serve this is on top of a piece or two of soft white bread, which helps mitigate the heat. A cold beer wouldn\u2019t hurt, either.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/dining/mc-nashville-hot-chicken/merlin_154348302_6054d377-9f8a-4a62-80f7-f2faa0efd2d2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 5 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "chicken, chili, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 329}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1079, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "73 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1033 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2  cup coarse kosher salt", "1/3  cup ground black pepper", "3  tablespoons onion powder", "3  tablespoons garlic powder", "3 tablespoons cayenne pepper", "3 tablespoons paprika", "3 1/2 pounds chicken, cut into 10 pieces", "3 tablespoons cayenne pepper", "1 to 2 teaspoons smoked ghost-chile powder or smoked hot paprika", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons granulated garlic", "3 tablespoons granulated onion", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons ground black pepper", "Safflower, corn or vegetable oil, for frying", "2 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the brine: In a large bowl, whisk salt and spices in 2 cups boiling water until salt dissolves.
