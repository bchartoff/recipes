{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hot Rum Punch", "description": "Nothing warms a cold body up like a quaff of hot rum punch. This version, spiked with cognac and infused with citrus and nutmeg, is exactly what you want to serve at a party once the temperature drops outside. If you\u2019re feeling flamboyant, you can flamb\u00e9 it, to the great amusement of your guests. Just make sure to use a fireproof bowl; silver or another metal is ideal, wood or even tempered glass is not. But even if you don\u2019t set it on fire, it\u2019s a rich, soothing and powerful libation. Serve it in small cups for the most civilized gathering.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/08/dining/Clark-new-hot-rum-punch/Clark-new-hot-rum-punch-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H20M", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "punches", "keywords": "cognac, demerara sugar, lemon, rum, tangerine, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 to 5 lemons", "1 tangerine, tangelo or other thick-skinned, small citrus fruit", "3/4 cup Demerara sugar", "1 1/4 cups amber or aged rum", "1 1/4 cups Jamaican rum (preferably 100-proof)", "1 cup cognac", "Freshly grated nutmeg, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest of 2 lemons and the tangerine in strips.
