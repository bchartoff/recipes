This recipe calls for making your own dukkah: You\u2019ll have more than you need, but keep any leftovers in a sealed container to sprinkle over salads, grilled meat or fish. A bunch of carrots from your farmers\u2019 market will work best here, but you can also use regular carrots that have been halved or quartered lengthwise. If you can\u2019t find bunches of carrots with their fresh tops, you can prepare the oil using parsley instead, or double the tarragon for an even more herbaceous version.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/19/dining/14Ottorex1/merlin_168725634_b46ec8ce-488c-486d-a1de-df8af7754d05-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "carrot, dukkah, greek yogurt, honey, olive oil, tarragon, side dish, spring, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 110}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 pounds/1 kilogram (6-inch/15-centimeter) carrots with greens attached", "3/4 cup/40 grams roughly chopped fresh tarragon leaves", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons/50 grams honey (runny honey)", "1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar", "1 2/3 cups/400 grams full-fat Greek yogurt", "1/4 cup/35 grams blanched hazelnuts, toasted", "1/4 cup/35 grams pine nuts, toasted", "2 tablespoons coriander seeds, toasted", "1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons black and white sesame seeds, toasted", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash and peel the carrots and trim the tops, leaving about 1 inch/3 centimeters of the greens attached.
