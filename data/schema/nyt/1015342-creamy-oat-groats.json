Like steel-cut oats, which are just pieces of groat that get broken during dehulling, groats have been prepared and eaten as hot cereal or gruel for centuries, sustaining generations of hard-working farmers and laborers. These days, it\u2019s fortifying the food elite.

Cook the shallot gently, without letting it color, until it is tender and aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cooled groats and stir well to reheat. When hot, turn off the heat and add about a cup of the hollandaise to create a creamy consistency; the quantity you add is your preference, but the groats should not become soupy or get lost in the sauce. Working quickly so that the heat of the groats doesn\u2019t split the hollandaise, add the lemon zest, herbs, and salt and pepper to taste.
