{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sancocho", "description": "Sancocho, a word often used as slang by Puerto Ricans to mean a big old mix of things, is a rustic stew eaten across the Caribbean and made with every imaginable combination of proteins and vegetables. My father cooked his with beef, corn and noodles; my mom with chicken breasts, lean pork and sweet plantains; my grandmother with beef, pork on the bone and yautia. As such, I\u2019ve rarely used a recipe, so this one is based largely on observation, taste memory and what I like. Pretty much every ingredient can be swapped out, and it also makes for a sumptuous vegetarian dish without meat. Sancocho epitomizes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/dining/puerto-rican-food.html\">the resilience of Puerto Rican people</a>, as it is often prepared in times of crisis \u2014 such as after a hurricane \u2014 and made with whatever you have on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/22/dining/22Puertoricanrex8-Guisada/merlin_184863222_11e57d4a-1d01-43c7-ab98-1d722c75733b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "meat, soups and stews, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "beef stew meat, calabaza, plantain, pork, spanish chorizo, squash, taro root, yuca", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium yuca", "1 medium white yautia (taro root)", "1 green plantain", "1 yellow sweet plantain", "10 ounces calabaza (pumpkin) or kabocha squash", "1 to 2 fresh ears sweet corn", "1 pound pork or beef stew meat, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 2-inch pieces", "1 pound boneless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 2-inch pieces", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022007-sofrito\">sofrito</a>", "10 cups pork or beef stock", "3 dried bay leaves", "1 cup thinly sliced Spanish chorizo", "Fresh bread or white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel and cut the yuca, yautia, green plantain and yellow plantain into 1-inch pieces.
