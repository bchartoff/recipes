{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Freekeh With Chicken, Almonds and Yogurt", "description": "Freekeh is unbelievably delicious. Just a bowl of it with a dab of yogurt would suffice, but for the full effect it should be topped with a savory stew of chicken or lamb. Freekeh is made from wheat that is harvested when the berries are still green and then burned to remove the chaff. It is often described as roasted, but when I say smoky, it really is. Use cracked freekeh as the whole-grain version takes longer to cook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/28/dining/23kitchenrex/merlin_158850912_6c0355af-9058-407c-90f6-e0167806f665-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "blanched almonds, chicken legs, freekeh, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 159}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups cracked freekeh", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup blanched almonds", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 teaspoon allspice", "1 (1-inch) stick of cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon salt", "5 cups unsalted chicken broth or water", "6 large chicken thighs, whole legs or a cut-up bird, about 3 pounds", "Salt and pepper", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon allspice", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 cups unsalted chicken broth or water", "A few sprigs flat leaf parsley", "2 cups plain yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pick over freekeh and rinse in cold water until water looks clear.
