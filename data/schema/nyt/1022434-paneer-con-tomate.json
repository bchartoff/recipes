{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Paneer con Tomate", "description": "Pan con tomate, the Spanish dish of grated tomato on grilled or toasted bread, is summery and extremely satisfying. Grating a tomato somehow emphasizes everything delicious about it, heightening sweetness and acidity. Paneer con tomate is built on the same principle, but swaps the bread for pieces of crisp-edged, lightly fried cheese. Here, the tomato pulp is seasoned not with olive oil, but with a glug of coconut oil infused with mustard seeds and curry leaves. If you\u2019ve got homemade paneer, which is looser and softer, then there\u2019s no need to fry it.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a> newsletter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/01/magazine/01mag-eat/01mag-eat-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings, as a snack or appetizer", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, for two, quick, snack, appetizer", "keywords": "curry leaves, paneer, tomatoes, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 481}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 to 2 big, ripe tomatoes\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon flaky salt\u00a0", "A few grinds of black pepper\u00a0", "1 (6- to 8-ounce) block firm paneer\u00a0", "3 tablespoons coconut oil", "1/4 teaspoon black mustard seeds", "1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds\u00a0", "1 sprig curry leaves (preferably fresh)\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using the large holes of a box grater, grate the tomatoes directly over a serving plate, pressing down with your palm so that all of the pulp goes through, and you\u2019re left with just the thin outer skin.
