Arrange 3 shrimp halves, cut side up, down the middle of the wrapper, leaving a 2-inch margin on the sides. Top with a handful of the carrot mixture, then with a handful of lettuce. Place a handful of rice over the lettuce. Fold the sides in, then roll up the spring rolls tightly, squeezing the filling to get a tight roll. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
