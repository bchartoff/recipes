{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Zucchini Agrodolce", "description": "Wherever the sun is powerful, it has been used to dry local produce. Sundried zucchini are commonly found in the markets in southern Italy, and this sweet-sour marinade, agrodolce, comes from even farther south, in Sicily. The flesh of the zucchini becomes dense and meaty when dried and, after frying, the slices perfectly soak up the aromatic, piquant, lively marinade. Served with slices of sopressata and a fresh orb of burrata, this dish is a delicious addition to an antipasto course. If you can use the sun to dry the zucchini where you live, do so; for the rest of us, the oven in your kitchen will do the trick.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/22/magazine/22mag-eat-copy/22mag-eat-copy-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "easy, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "cider vinegar, mint, zucchini, summer, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 224}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 firm medium zucchini, trimmed", "Kosher salt", "Good-quality olive oil", "Handful of fresh mint leaves", "1 cup cider vinegar", "1/3 cup granulated sugar", "2 pinches homemade or good store-bought chile flakes", "2 garlic cloves, slivered"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the zucchini: Heat the oven to 200 degrees.
