This combination of an especially lovely Spanish vermouth, fresh grapefruit juice, tonic, and bitters has become a fast favorite \u2014 and I've yet to serve it to anyone who doesn't love it, too. You could serve it in a highball, or a double old fashioned glass, but I like it best in a large wineglass, which makes it even more festive.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/09/magazine/09drink2/09drink2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "1 cocktail", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "grapefruit juice, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 15}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 oz.
