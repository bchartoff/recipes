{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Indian-Spiced Tomato and Egg Casserole", "description": "This dish, inspired by a traditional recipe from the Parsis (a group of Zoroastrians from Persia who settled in India sometime between the 8th and 10th centuries), is possibly one of the most fragrant and vivid casseroles you\u2019ll ever see. It starts with a highly spiced tomato sauce flavored with mint, green chiles and ginger. The sauce is then poured over a layer of sliced cooked fingerling potatoes and baked. At the end of the cooking time, wells are made in the sauce and eggs cracked into them to finish baking. The result is a tomato-rich casserole with runny yolk over each pungent bite. Serve it for dinner or for brunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/dining/30faqrex2/merlin_153975036_427d4d2c-bcf1-4707-aeab-d293cf45b71b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner", "keywords": "eggs, potato, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1503}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 274, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "782 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes", "Kosher salt", "1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1 yellow onion, diced", "1 poblano pepper, seeded if desired, finely chopped", "2 jalape\u00f1o peppers, seeded if desired, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons finely chopped peeled ginger", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground garam masala", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes", "1/4 cup chopped fresh mint, more for garnish", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro or basil, more for garnish", "6 eggs", "Black pepper, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with generously salted water.
