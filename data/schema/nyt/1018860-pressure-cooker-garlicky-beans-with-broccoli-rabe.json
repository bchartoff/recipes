It\u2019s used in the pot along with the simmering beans, and also fried in olive oil as a crunchy, pungent garnish. As a contrast, the broccoli rabe and red onion get very sweet when you saut\u00e9 them slowly until they are browned and caramelized. Alongside the soft, mild white beans, it\u2019s a satisfying and comforting dish with a garlicky kick.\n\n\n<i>This is one of <a href=\"/68861692/7716592-melissa-clark-dinner-in-an-instant\">10 recipes</a> from Melissa Clark\u2019s \u201cDinner in an Instant: 75 Modern Recipes for Your Pressure Cooker, Multicooker, and Instant Pot\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2017).</i>\n\n<i>Melissa Clark\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562277/dinner-in-an-instant-by-melissa-clark/9781524762964/\">\u201cDinner in an Instant\u201d</a> is available everywhere books are sold. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Instant-Recipes-Pressure-Multicooker-ebook/dp/B06XK41BQV/?tag=NYTBks-20&ascsubtag=dinnerinstant\">Order your copy today.</a></i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/25/dining/garlickybeansbroccolirabe/garlickybeansbroccolirabe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, beans, cookbook exclusive", "keywords": "broccoli rabe, cannellini beans, garlic, rosemary, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 366}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 392, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "357 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried cannellini or other white beans", "7 garlic cloves: 4 smashed, 3 thinly sliced", "4 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 large sprig fresh rosemary", "1 bay leaf", "1 carrot, trimmed", "1 large or 2 small red onions, halved and thinly sliced", "1 pound fresh broccoli rabe, woody ends trimmed", "1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the pressure cooker, combine the beans, 7 cups of water, the 4 smashed garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and 2 teaspoons of the salt.
