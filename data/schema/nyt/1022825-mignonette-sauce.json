{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mignonette Sauce", "description": "This simple recipe gives you a classic mignonette sauce for oysters, clams or other seafood, but you can play with the basic formula by changing the vinegar (try cider, malt, sherry, champagne), swapping the allium (try leeks, scallions or red onion), adding a squeeze of citrus juice or stirring in some fresh herbs like tarragon or mint. Let the mixture sit for at least 30 minutes before serving, so the flavors can blend and the sauce can be at its tangy, peppery best.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/22/dining/17oystersrex2-mignonette/merlin_199179765_20f0bcd3-ef62-432d-9e3d-fed1833e71dd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2/3 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "red wine vinegar, shallot", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 160}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup finely minced shallots (from 1 to 2 shallots)", "1/3 cup red-wine or white-wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon coarsely\u00a0ground black or white peppercorns", "Pinch of sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix together all the ingredients in a small\u00a0bowl or jar until well blended.
