{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Warak Dawali (Stuffed Grape Leaves)\u00a0", "description": "Stuffed grape leaves are so prevalent across the Arab world and the Mediterranean that it can seem like there are as many variations as there are families. This recipe is for traditional Levantine versions existing in Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, which generally have a warmly spiced beef and rice filling, are rich from being cooked with either meat at the bottom of the pot or chicken broth, and involve stuffed grape leaves that are rolled fairly thin and long. It\u2019s a hallmark of any celebratory or holiday table, and perfect served with a side of plain yogurt. Though they are time-consuming, warak dawali are a very fun project to embark on with family or friends, and leftovers store wonderfully, up to 3 days in the fridge or a couple of months in the freezer.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Reem Kassis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/14/multimedia/07kubbehrex1-warak-dawali-1-f5e3/07kubbehrex1-warak-dawali-1-f5e3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "allspice, ground beef, ground cinnamon, project, rice, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 58}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound short- or medium-grain rice", "4 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter (or a combination)", "1 tablespoon fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon tomato paste\u00a0", "1 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg\u00a0", "1 pound ground beef", "2 (16-ounce) jars grape leaves in brine (approximately 90 to 100 leaves for rolling; extras will be used to line the pot); see Tip", "8 bone-in lamb chops (about 1 1/2 pounds), 6 flanken-cut beef short ribs (about 2 pounds) or 1 3/4 pounds chuck roast (trimmed and cut into 6 to 8 even steaks); optional", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "3 medium tomatoes, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds", "4 cups chicken broth or water\u00a0", "1 tablespoon tomato paste\u00a0", "1 tablespoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\u00a0", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste", "Plain yogurt, to serve\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a kettle of water to a boil.

(Aim for leaves that are about the size of an adult\u2019s palm. If any are exceptionally bigger or smaller than that, set them aside to use for lining the pot later.) Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife, cut out each tough central stem. Place 1 scant tablespoon of the rice filling above the cut-out stem section of each leaf. Using your fingers, spread the filling horizontally into a 1/4-inch-thick log that is about 4 inches long, leaving a 1/2- to 1-inch border on either end. Fold the sides of the grape leaves over the filling, then, working from the end nearest to you, fold each leaf up to cover the filling, rolling away from you. Rolls should be tight enough that they hold but not so tight that there\u2019s no space for the rice to expand. (If rolled too tightly, rolls may burst during cooking.)
