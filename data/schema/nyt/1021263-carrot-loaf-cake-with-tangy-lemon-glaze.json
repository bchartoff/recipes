{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carrot Loaf Cake With Tangy Lemon Glaze", "description": "This easy, breezy one-bowl loaf cake makes the perfect afternoon snack \u2014 and a perfect breakfast the next day, too. It\u2019s lightly spiced and nut- and fruit-free, but feel free to add about 1/2 cup of chopped nuts or dried fruit, if that\u2019s how you like your carrot cake. There is an optional bit of grated carrot in the lemony glaze, which doesn\u2019t lend that much flavor, but provides a lovely light orange hue. If grating carrot for the glaze seems fussy, you can certainly skip it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/dining/ya-carrot-loaf-cake/ya-carrot-loaf-cake-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 (9-by-5-inch) loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, snack", "keywords": "cardamom, carrot, carrot cake, cinnamon, confectioners' sugar, flour, lemon, loaf cake", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 4317}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/180 milliliters neutral oil or mild olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 cup/225 grams packed light brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/2 packed cups peeled and grated carrots (about 6 ounces/165 grams, from 3 medium carrots)", "1 lemon", "1 cup/100 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 tablespoon finely grated carrot (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees and set a rack in the center.
