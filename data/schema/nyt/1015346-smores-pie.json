Pour 1/4 cup water into the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the gelatin on top.

Heat until a candy thermometer reads 260 degrees, or hard-ball stage. Remove from heat, turn stand mixer to medium speed to begin beating the bloomed gelatin, and slowly pour in sugar syrup, aiming it down the side of the bowl to prevent splatter, and scraping any remaining syrup from the pan with a heat-proof spatula. Slowly increase the speed of the mixer, and beat until the mixture is white, fluffy and doubled in volume. Add vanilla and beat for a few moments more. Pour the mixture on top of the cooled chocolate layer, gently spreading it to the edges of the crust with a spatula.

If using a torch, clear the area of any flammable items, ignite the torch, and slowly wave the flame over the surface of the marshmallow until you achieve the desired level of toastiness. If you do not have a torch, use the broiler of your oven.
