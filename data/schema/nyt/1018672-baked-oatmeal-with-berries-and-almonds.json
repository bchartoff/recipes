You can use any fruit here instead of \u2014\u00a0or in combination with \u2014\u00a0the berries. Cubed apples or pears, bananas, pineapple or even mango will add a sweet juiciness to the mix. And for something even richer, serve this doused in heavy cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/27/dining/27COOKING-BAKED-OATMEAL-BERRY1/27COOKING-BAKED-OATMEAL-BERRY1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "almonds, berries, nutmeg, oatmeal, high fiber, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 586}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 456, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "417 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 4 tablespoons melted butter, to taste", "3 cups berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries or a combination)", "2 cups oatmeal (not instant)", "1 cup toasted, unsalted almonds, coarsely chopped", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 cups milk (or substitute coconut or almond milk)", "2 large eggs", "1/2 cup turbinado sugar or light or dark brown sugar, plus more for topping, if you like", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "Heavy cream, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
