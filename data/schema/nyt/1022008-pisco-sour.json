{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pisco Sour", "description": "The pisco sour is sweet-tart, richly textured and crowned with a fluffy white top. The origins of the drink, a blend of pisco (a South American brandy), citrus, sugar and egg white, come with some debate as to whether it originated in Chile or Peru. But it is most commonly said to have been created in the early 20th century by Victor Morris, an American expatriate in Peru. While this recipe calls for using exclusively lime juice, a combination of fresh lime and lemon juice (1/2 ounce lemon, 1/2 ounce lime) works as well. Just don\u2019t skip the aromatic bitters, added as a final garnish and often in a decorative pattern: They contribute to the drink\u2019s final aesthetic and aroma.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/19soursrex1-pisco/merlin_185056041_5a11f4c2-0090-4475-8d74-8160cde41c9a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "angostura bitters, egg whites, pisco, simple syrup, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 105}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup granulated or turbinado sugar", "2 ounces pisco", "1 ounce fresh lime juice", "1 egg white", "3/4 ounce 2-to-1 simple syrup", "Ice", "3 to 4 dashes Angostura bitters"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the simple syrup: In a small saucepan, combine sugar with 1/4 cup water.
