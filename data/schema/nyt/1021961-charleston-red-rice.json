It often contains sausage, but this version, inspired by how the chef Millie Peartree\u2019s mother, Millie Bell, used to make it, relies on bacon for its depth. (Still, if you\u2019d like to add sausage, just let it sear with the vegetables in Step 3.) To start, the \u201choly trinity\u201d (bell pepper, onion and celery) is cooked in the bacon fat, infusing the cooking liquid. Then, the rice is baked to ensure it\u2019s perfectly cooked. Serve this alongside baked chicken or ham, green beans or collard greens, for a full, satisfying meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/01/dining/mp-red-rice/merlin_182011956_8f9f5ac7-81bc-43e1-83bb-564b94705c79-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, side dish", "keywords": "bacon, cajun seasoning, celery, hot sauce, onion, rice, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 767}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "6 bacon slices", "1 medium Vidalia or other sweet, Spanish or yellow onion, chopped", "2 celery ribs, chopped", "1 large green bell pepper, chopped", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 cups long-grain or Carolina gold rice, rinsed until water runs clear", "1 (14-ounce) can tomato pur\u00e9e", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock or water, plus more as needed", "1 tablespoon hot sauce", "1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Pinch of ground cayenne", "Parsley leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) heavy skillet over medium heat, fry the bacon until crisp, about 3 minutes per side.
