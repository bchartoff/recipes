Make the custard in advance, but wait to caramelize the topping about 10 minutes before serving. The sugar will not hold its signature crunch if subjected to much extra time in a humid refrigerator. While it may be a single-use gadget, a kitchen torch is an inexpensive tool worth the investment. It does the best job at caramelizing the top without warming the custard, and it\u2019s so fun to use.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/22/dining/22COOKING-EGGNOG-CREMEBRULEE2/22COOKING-EGGNOG-CREMEBRULEE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "bourbon, nutmeg, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 171}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 284, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "162 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup/101 grams granulated sugar, plus up to 1/2 cup/101 grams for sprinkling", "3/4 teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 cups heavy cream", "1 cup whole milk", "1 tablespoon bourbon\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
