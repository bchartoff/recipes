{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole-Wheat Chocolate Chip Loaf Cake", "description": "Nutty whole-wheat flour and semisweet chocolate are a winning pair in this easy-to-make one-bowl loaf cake. Whole-wheat flour gives this cake depth and a nubbly texture that is tastier than that of your average all-purpose flour, and semisweet chocolate makes it a special treat. You can use whatever type of chocolate chips you prefer, and chopped chocolate works, too, if that\u2019s what you have on hand. You can also use a greater proportion of whole-wheat flour if you like \u2014 up to about 1 cup/128 grams of the total 1\u00bd cups flour works well \u2014 but the cake will be a bit more dense. It will still be delicious, but it will have a slightly different texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/18/dining/ya-whole-wheat-chocolate-chip-loaf/merlin_205522503_39777bb5-34be-41be-8e85-aa42d96ae6fe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "1 loaf (about 8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "chocolate chips, loaf cake, make-ahead, one bowl, sour cream, whole wheat flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 272}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup/56 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup/150 grams light brown sugar", "1 cup/235 grams sour cream", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters neutral oil", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) or \u00bd teaspoon fine salt, plus more for sprinkling", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/64 grams whole-wheat flour", "1 cup/170 grams semisweet chocolate chips", "1 teaspoon turbinado sugar or granulated sugar, to finish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and butter a light-colored metal 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan.
