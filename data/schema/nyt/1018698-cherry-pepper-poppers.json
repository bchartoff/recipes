Though their charms are many, my favorite is their stuffable shape. The heat of the cherry pepper varies from fiery to mellow, though the riper red ones tend to be sweeter and none are as spicy as the jalape\u00f1o. Arrange them on a platter for the cocktail hour. They are supple and jewel-like, and incredibly easy to make.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/10/15/dining/cherry-pepper-popper/cherry-pepper-popper-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT12H10M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, cherry peppers, prosciutto, provolone, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 564, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1371 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 cherry peppers, a mix of red and green is nice", "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "2 tablespoons red or white wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup extra virgin olive oil, more if needed", "2 sprigs basil", "2 sprigs rosemary", "2 garlic cloves, smashed", "1/2 pound cheese such as provolone, fresh mozzarella or Gorgonzola, or a combination", "1/2 pound thinly sliced prosciutto"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a paring knife, trim tops off peppers and cut out their centers, including seeds and veins."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a quart jar (or one just large enough to hold the peppers), combine vinegars and salt, and stir well to dissolve salt.
