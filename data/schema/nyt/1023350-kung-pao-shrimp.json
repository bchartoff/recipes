{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kung Pao Shrimp", "description": "The name of this dish is now written in English as gong bao shrimp, and this recipe takes inspiration from the American Chinese versions that come from the Sichuan Province of China. Here, flashes of chile heat shine in a glossy swirl of a salty, sour and sweet sauce. With a confetti blend of shrimp, peppers and peanuts, each mouthful is a little spicy and chewy, savory and crisp. The deep malty tang comes from Chinkiang vinegar, a jet-black condiment from China that is traditionally fermented from grains and aged in clay. It\u2019s key to this dish and also delicious for dipping dumplings, saucing noodles and dressing vegetables. (Balsamic vinegar, similarly fermented and aged from grape juice in barrels, is a fun, fruity substitute.) With both vegetables and protein, this one-wok stir-fry is a complete meal with steamed rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/27/dining/22korex1-shrimp/merlin_210310542_ee8ce89f-bc6f-4038-87ec-0b9951ca4b1b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, Chinkiang vinegar, shrimp, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 491}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp, thawed if frozen", "2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine or dry sherry", "2 teaspoons cornstarch", "Salt", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons Chinkiang (black) vinegar or balsamic vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, coarsely ground, plus more to taste", "1 red or orange bell pepper", "5 garlic cloves", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed", "1/2 cup unsalted roasted peanuts", "3/4 cup small dried red chiles (23 grams; see Tip)", "3 large scallions, cut into 1/2-inch lengths"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix the shrimp, Shaoxing wine, 1 teaspoon cornstarch and a pinch of salt in a bowl until the shrimp are evenly coated.
