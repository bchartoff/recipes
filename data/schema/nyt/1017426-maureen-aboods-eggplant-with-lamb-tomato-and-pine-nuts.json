Even better, it\u2019s just as good served warm or room temperature as it is hot from the oven. It also reheats well, meaning that you can bake it the day before, and reheat it before serving if you like. Pull it out of the refrigerator, let it come to room temperature for an hour, then reheat it covered for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/27/dining/27COOKBOOK3/27COOKBOOK3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, casseroles, main course", "keywords": "eggplant, lamb, lebanese, make-ahead, mozzarella, tomato sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1686}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 478, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "854 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large firm eggplants, cut into 1/2-inch slices", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1 medium yellow onion, finely diced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 pound ground lamb or beef (80 percent lean)", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Black pepper", "1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1/2 cup pine nuts", "1 (28-ounce) can tomato sauce, or 31/2 cups homemade sauce (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017173-simple-tomato-sauce\">see recipe</a>)", "12 ounces fresh mozzarella, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat broiler and line a baking sheet with foil or parchment."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brush both sides of eggplant slices with 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt.
