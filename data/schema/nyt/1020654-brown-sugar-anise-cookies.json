{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Sugar-Anise Cookies", "description": "This big, irresistible cookie takes almost no time to make, and is great for those occasions when you want a delicious treat, fast. If you think you don\u2019t like anise seeds, you might enjoy their fragrant notes in this recipe, but you can always use sesame seeds instead. Or leave them out altogether \u2014 these cookies are still good with just sugar (use turbinado if you don\u2019t have sanding or sparkling sugar). You can keep the rolled-out dough in the freezer, and throw it in the oven for a dinner party. With a little sorbet or ice cream, you have a dessert ready for company.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/ss-anise-cookie/ss-anise-cookie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "About 30 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "anise, aniseed, brown sugar, butter, flour, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 292}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/3 cup/45 grams cornstarch", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), softened", "1/2 cup/110 grams light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla paste or extract, or scrapings from 1/2 vanilla bean", "1 egg white", "2 teaspoons anise seeds", "1/4 cup/50 grams sanding or sparkling sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
