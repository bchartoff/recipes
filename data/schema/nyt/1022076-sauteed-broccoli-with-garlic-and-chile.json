{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saut\u00e9ed Broccoli With Garlic and Chile", "description": "This speedy, two-step recipe yields broccoli \u2014 or practically any vegetable \u2014 that is perfectly browned and cooked all the way through. After florets and thinly sliced stems are seared, add a little water and cover so the broccoli steams in its own juices until fork-tender. Not only does this bring out the vegetable\u2019s inherent sweetness, but it softens whatever flavorings you add without burning them. This recipe embraces the prickly heat of chile and garlic, but you could also use ground spices, thyme or rosemary, ginger or scallions, capers or olives. Swap the broccoli for sliced carrots or sweet potatoes, cauliflower florets, broccoli rabe, or green beans, adjusting cook time and water as necessary.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/01/dining/as-sauteed-broccoli/merlin_184703334_fb3f13cc-a80d-4959-86d7-4ef4ca5918d0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "broccoli, garlic, red pepper flakes, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 422}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound broccoli, cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch-long florets, stems sliced 1/4-inch thick", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 garlic cloves, sliced", "Red-pepper flakes, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high.
