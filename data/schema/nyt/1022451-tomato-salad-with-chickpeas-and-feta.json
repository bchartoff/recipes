{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tomato Salad With Chickpeas and Feta", "description": "Peak summer eating doesn\u2019t get much easier than this fresh tomato salad. Ripe, in-season tomatoes are best, but if they are not in their prime, the simple technique of salting them first will draw out maximum flavor. Roasted nuts and seeds are excellent pantry items and make a perfect no-cook, savory-sweet crisp topping. The nut-seed-spice mixture is completely flexible; use what you have on hand, and add aromatic seeds like nigella or fennel if you like. The store-bought granola is optional, but it adds a surprising sweetness and even more crunch. (Opt for one that is as plain as possible and without dried fruits or chocolate.) Make extra topping and keep it in an airtight jar for sprinkling over salads and roasted vegetables.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a> newsletter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/02/dining/hm-tomato-and-chickpea-salad/merlin_192092781_568b4af1-5ef8-475b-8a6c-6b6d577bf123-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "chickpea, feta, tomato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 981}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes (any variety), cut into roughly 1- to 2-inch pieces", "1 garlic clove, grated", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained", "1 (7-ounce) block feta cheese, crumbled", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "Handful of basil leaves", "1/4 cup roasted, salted shelled sunflower seeds, roughly chopped (see Tip)", "1/4 cup roasted, salted pepitas, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup roasted, salted almonds, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup roasted, salted pistachios, roughly chopped", "1/2 cup plain oat granola (no fruit or chocolate added), roughly chopped (optional)", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon chile powder or red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place tomatoes into a large bowl and add the garlic and 1 teaspoon salt.
