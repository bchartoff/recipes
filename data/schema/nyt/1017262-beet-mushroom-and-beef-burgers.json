{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beet, Mushroom and Beef Burgers", "description": "I incorporated a roasted beet into the beef and roasted mushroom mix, allowing me to shave another couple of ounces of beef off the formula, and the resulting burger is a winner. The beet contributes moisture, texture and great color \u2013 almost a rare meaty look \u2013 to these almost-veggie burgers (I tried the grated roasted beets and mushrooms as a mix without the meat and it didn\u2019t hold together; I plan to work on a vegetarian version at a later date.) Meanwhile I love the texture of this patty and the herbal flavors of the mint and chives. If you want to splurge a little (after all there are only 2 ounces of beef in each patty), melt a little blue cheese or gorgonzola on top. I like to serve this with a spicy green, like baby arugula or mizuna.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/04/science/recipehealthbeet/recipehealthbeet-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers, vegetables", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low-sodium, nut-free, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 58}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 201, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "378 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 pound peeled roasted beets (1 medium)", "1/2 pound <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017259-roasted-mushroom-base\">roasted mushroom mix</a>", "1/2 pound lean ground beef", "1 tablespoon minced chives", "1 shallot minced", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice (more or less to taste)", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "Olive oil for cooking (no more than 1 tablespoon)", "1 tablespoon finely chopped mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate beet on large holes of a grater."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": ".
