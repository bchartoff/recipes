{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blackberry Apple Pie", "description": "Packed with spiced fruit, this feels like an old-fashioned apple pie, with a coziness beneath the modern lattice. Juicy blackberries highlight the tanginess of sweet-tart apples and tint the filling a mellow shade of pink. Wide dough strips, tightly woven, leave just enough of a gap in the top to allow a little steam to vent. Keeping the abundance of fruit mostly encased helps it bake through to tenderness and allows their juices to thicken to a jammy syrup. If you don\u2019t want to weave a lattice, you can simply cover the filling with a round of rolled dough and cut vent holes in it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/13/dining/13PIESREX-blackberry-apple/merlin_214872687_19d9a5c6-6bfa-43b1-8f61-81919b998e82-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "apple, apple pie, blackberry, lemon juice, pie, pie dough, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 329}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup/140 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/34 grams cornstarch", "2 teaspoons apple pie spice or your favorite blend of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021926-sweet-baking-spice\">baking spices</a>", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "12 ounces/340 grams blackberries (about 3 scant cups), cut into halves", "3 1/4 pounds/1 1/2 kilograms tart-sweet apples (about 8 medium), such as Ginger Gold and Honeycrisp, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 full recipe <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023573\">All-Butter Pie Crust</a>, chilled as 3 disks for a double-crust lattice pie", "All-purpose flour, for rolling\u00a0", "2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces", "2 tablespoons heavy cream", "Sparkling or other coarse sugar, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a very large bowl, whisk the granulated sugar, cornstarch, spice and salt.
