Reduce the heat to medium low and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the wine. Increase the heat to medium high and simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 minutes. Add the barley and stir. Ladle in 1/2 cup of the hot broth and stir until all the liquid has been absorbed. Continue adding 1/2 cup of broth at a time, stirring until absorbed, until the barley is tender, about 30 minutes.
