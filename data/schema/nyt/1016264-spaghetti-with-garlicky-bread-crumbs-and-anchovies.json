{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaghetti With Garlicky Bread Crumbs and Anchovies", "description": "This is a take on a classic dish from Southern Italy that tosses pasta with toasted, seasoned bread crumbs called pangrattatto. In this version, the bread crumbs are saut\u00e9ed in olive oil with garlic and anchovies until golden and crisp, and the pasta is coated with egg yolks, hot sauce and Asian fish sauce for creaminess and depth. You can make the bread crumbs up to 3 hours ahead; longer than that and you risk letting them go soggy. Use good-quality bread crumbs here, either homemade or purchased from a bakery. The next best choice is panko, Japanese bread crumbs that you can find in large supermarkets. If you have any of the pangrattatto mixture left over, store it in the refrigerator and give it a brief saut\u00e9 to revive it before using.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/18/multimedia/clark-spaghetti-bread/clark-spaghetti-bread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, pastas", "keywords": "anchovies, bread crumbs, egg yolks, spaghetti, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 540}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 744, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "107 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "661 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "12 anchovies, chopped", "6 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1 cup good dried bread crumbs", "Black pepper and kosher salt, as needed", "1 pound spaghetti", "2  egg yolks", "1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce (optional)", "1 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste", "1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, warm oil.
