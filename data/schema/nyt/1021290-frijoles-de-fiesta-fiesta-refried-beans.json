{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Frijoles de Fiesta (Fiesta Refried Beans)", "description": "Fiesta refried beans are a must for quincea\u00f1era celebrations in the state of Sonora, and variations can be found in just about every carne asada gathering, taqueria and home. They belong to the category of frijoles maneados, a name that comes from having to constantly use your hands, manos, to stir the pot to get the texture right. Maneados are made with creamy pintos or buttery mayocoba beans that are cooked, mashed and cooked again in lard or oil. As they thicken, melty cheese is added. Fiesta refried beans go a step further by including fresh, dried or pickled chiles, and meats like chorizo. This version gets its peppy flavor from Colorado chiles and its smoke and spice from chipotles in adobo sauce. Salty crumbled Cotija crowns the dish. Aside from being fundamental to Sonoran carne asada tacos, these beans can also be slathered on flour tortillas for burritos, dipped with chips, filled in quesadillas, layered on tortas, scooped next to grilled meats or have eggs sitting over them. They are so accommodating that they end up in almost every Sonoran meal, becoming essential.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10carneasadarex-frijoles/merlin_175265244_a5ee0099-c1d9-4094-b569-0d379634ba5b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "beans, side dish", "keywords": "chipotles in adobo, cotija, pinto beans", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 471}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried pinto beans, rinsed (see Note)", "1/2 large white onion", "1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt, plus more as needed", "4 dried Colorado chiles (also known as California or New Mexico chiles), or guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded", "1 to 2 whole canned chipotles in adobo, plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil or lard", "8 ounces asadero, quesadilla, Monterey Jack or Oaxaca cheese, grated (about 2 cups)", "1 ounce crumbled Cotija (about 1/4 cup), for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place pinto beans in a large pot and cover with 14 cups water.
