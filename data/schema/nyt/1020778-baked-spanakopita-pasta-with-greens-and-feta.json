{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Spanakopita Pasta With Greens and Feta", "description": "This baked pasta is inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020101-spanakopita?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=2\">spanakopita</a>, the classic Greek spinach and feta pie. This loose interpretation combines pasta with gooey mozzarella, briny feta, plenty of greens and a rich cream sauce, which is then piled into a dish and baked until golden. The key to this dish is in the greens: Use at least three kinds \u2014 a mellow one, a peppery one and a fresh herb or two \u2014 to create an exciting mix of flavors. No need to saut\u00e9 them; just salt and massage them until they wilt slightly. This cozy dish might be the best way to eat your greens all year long.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/14/dining/as-spanakopita-pasta/merlin_166521339_8809a046-8555-498e-9eac-bfa50b773192-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, pastas", "keywords": "arugula, butter, cream cheese, dill, feta, mozzarella, parsley, pasta, scallion, spinach, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 848}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 cups chopped spinach, Swiss chard or other mild greens (tough stems removed)", "4 cups chopped arugula, watercress or other peppery greens", "1 cup chopped fresh dill or parsley leaves and tender stems, or a combination", "6 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced, whites and dark green parts separated", "1 pound tubular or curvy pasta, like rigatoni or fusilli", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "8 ounces cream cheese (1 cup), cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "4 ounces mozzarella, grated (1 cup)", "4 ounces crumbled feta (1 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
