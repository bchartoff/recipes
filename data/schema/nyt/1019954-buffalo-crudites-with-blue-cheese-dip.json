{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buffalo Crudit\u00e9s With Blue Cheese Dip", "description": "Doused in something spicy, crisp crudit\u00e9s can become habit-forming. Inspired by the Buffalo cucumber salad at Parm in New York, this recipe coats the traditional sidekicks to Buffalo chicken \u2014 celery, carrots and other raw vegetables \u2014 in the garlic-spiked hot sauce that is traditionally doused on wings. The result is finger food at its finest: crunchy, flavor-packed and begging for beer (and blue cheese). Buffalo chicken wings might be written off as a bar fixture, but they\u2019re a great example of contrasts: hot and cold, spicy and cooling, crisp and juicy. Like kimchi or chile-flecked melon, these crudit\u00e9s accentuate the play between spicy and fresh.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/dining/as-buffalo-crudites/as-buffalo-crudites-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "quick, snack, dips and spreads, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, blue cheese, hot sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 14}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 330, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1133 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces blue cheese, crumbled (about 3/4 cup)", "1/4 cup mayonnaise", "1/4 cup sour cream", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or apple cider vinegar", "1 to 3 tablespoons milk or buttermilk, or to taste", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup Louisiana-style hot sauce, such as Frank\u2019s", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large garlic clove, grated", "4 cups raw chopped vegetables, such as a mix of celery, carrots, cucumbers, radishes and snap peas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dip: In a small bowl, stir together the blue cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream and lemon juice.
