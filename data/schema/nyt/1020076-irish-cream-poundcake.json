{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Irish Cream Poundcake", "description": "This classic poundcake has a boozy twist that\u2019s perfect for parties, St. Patrick\u2019s Day and beyond. Irish cream liqueur \u2014 a rich blend of Irish whiskey, cream, sugar, vanilla and other flavorings \u2014 is added to both the batter and the glaze, which yields doubly flavorful results. The alcohol in the cake burns off during baking, but if you\u2019d like to mute the hint of alcohol in the glaze, simply bring the Irish cream to a simmer and let it cool before whisking it with the confectioners\u2019 sugar. Serve the cake alone, with a scoop of coffee ice cream or a hot cup of coffee (spiked with Irish cream, perhaps). The cake keeps well at room temperature, tightly wrapped, for up to 4 days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/04/dining/em-irish-cream-poundcake/em-irish-cream-poundcake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, irish", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, flour, Irish cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 501}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 616, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "75 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "268 milligrams", "sugarContent": "53 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 2/3 cups/215 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan", "2/3 cup/145 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters Irish cream", "1 1/4 cups/155 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3 tablespoons Irish cream, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
