And I'm sure they are right. But I'm just as sure that what turns sugar into caramel is magic. Not only is caramel simple, but it is also versatile. Caramelized sugar mixed with butter and cream makes candies soft as taffy or hard as lollipops; thinned with water, it makes a glaze; thinned with cream, it makes a sauce; added to chocolate, it provides complexity; and added to custards, it can provide all the flavor needed for a spoon dessert. This luscious, golden pudding is a perfect example.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/30/dining/30COOKING-CARATS-DE-CREME1/30COOKING-CARATS-DE-CREME1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "dessert, eggs, heavy cream, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 67}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 349, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "59 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups heavy cream", "1 cup whole milk", "3/4 cup sugar", "5 large egg yolks", "2 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in oven, and heat to 300 degrees.
