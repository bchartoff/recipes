This recipe is adapted from Michael Bao Huynh, a chef and restaurateur who came to the United States as a refugee in 1982. Thit kho to is traditionally made with pork belly, but it can also be made with pork shoulder butt (as shown in the photo) \u2013 a lighter though no less delicious alternative. Serve the meat over a pile of snowy white rice with a bottle of hot pepper sauce nearby.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dana Bowen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/05/dining/07COOKING-VIETNAMESE-PORK1/07COOKING-VIETNAMESE-PORK1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "main course, pork", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 719}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups sugar", "2 1/2 pounds pork belly or butt, sliced into thin, inch-long strips", "1 tablespoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup fish sauce", "2 heaping teaspoons minced garlic", "1 dash sesame oil", "1 medium Vidalia onion, sliced", "4 scallions, sliced, green part only", "Rice for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cover bottom of a large, heavy skillet with one cup sugar and place over medium low heat.
