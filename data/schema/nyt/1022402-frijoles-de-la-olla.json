It\u2019s so simple, yet so filling and delicious. Frijoles de la olla are beans cooked in a pot, and here, that pot is an electric pressure cooker, which makes preparation quicker and even more hands-off. Seasonings like dried chiles, garlic and dried mushrooms take the broth\u2019s flavor to another level. For a spicier version, toss in some chiles de \u00e1rbol, too. You can swap in dried black or flor de junio beans for an equally delicious and rich broth. Any leftovers would be great in enfrijoladas or chili.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/14/dining/jr-Frijoles-de-la-Olla/merlin_189647439_b38a2da3-2d33-4b43-80a4-080f1df888b1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, main course", "keywords": "dried mushrooms, guajillo chiles, instant pot, jalape\u00f1o, pinto beans, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 689}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups dried pinto beans (12 ounces)", "1 large dried ancho chile or 3 dried pasilla chiles, stemmed, seeded and rinsed", "2 large dried guajillo chiles, stemmed, seeded and rinsed", "1 dried avocado leaf", "2 dried bay leaves", "2 large black garlic or regular garlic cloves, peeled", "1/4 cup mixed dried mushrooms (1/4 ounce), coarsely crumbled if large", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste\u00a0", "2 jalape\u00f1os, halved lengthwise", "8 corn tortillas, for serving", "1/4 cup tightly packed cilantro leaves", "2 ripe Hass avocados, pitted, peeled and sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the beans, chiles, avocado leaf, bay leaves, garlic, dried mushrooms, salt and 8 cups water to an electric pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot), and set to cook for 40 minutes at high pressure."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "During the last few minutes of cooking, lightly char the jalape\u00f1os over the open high flame of a gas burner, or sear them on a comal or in a dry, heavy skillet over medium-high heat until blackened and beginning to soften, 3 to 5 minutes over a flame or about 10 minutes in a skillet.
