Like many other fried rice recipes, this version, from the chef Lara Lee\u2019s \u201cCoconut & Sambal,\u201d blends crunchy vegetables with piquant rice, but the addition of ginger and white pepper offer spice and aroma, while kecap manis, a velvety sauce, adds a slightly sweet balance to the dish. Don\u2019t skimp on the fried egg or the fried shallots; both add essential crunch and texture.
