{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Cheesecake With Graham Cracker Crunch", "description": "It\u2019s worth tasting a few brands of graham crackers to find one you particularly like \u2014 preferably one with whole-wheat flour and a good dash of salt and honey or molasses. Try a health-food store or Whole Foods for organic and low-sugar brands. (Graham flour was devised in the 19th century as a healthful alternative to white flour.) Fresh, fluffy cream cheese with a minimum of fillers and stabilizers is also worth seeking out for this recipe. This recipe works fine with supermarket cream cheese and graham cracker crumbs (or dark chocolate cookie crumbs) in the crust, but the filling must be made with top-quality chocolate to get the full effect: milky cream cheese, tangy sour cream and the slight bitterness of chocolate playing against the sweet crunch of the crust. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been made since 1984 at the Saltry restaurant in Halibut Cove, off the southern Alaska coast.  All of the ingredients (as well as the equipment, furniture, staff and customers) arrive by boat \u2014 except for the magnificent salmon, oysters, halibut, cod and mussels that are caught or harvested nearby.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/15/dining/15COOKING-CHEESECAKE1/15COOKING-CHEESECAKE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "brown sugar, chocolate, graham cracker, sour cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 367}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 570, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "359 milligrams", "sugarContent": "40 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/170 grams graham cracker crumbs", "1/2 cup/100 grams light brown sugar", "4 tablespoons/50 grams (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted", "1 cup/250 milliliters sour cream", "8 ounces/250 grams best-quality semisweet chocolate, preferably Callebaut, broken into pieces", "1 1/2 pounds/700 grams cream cheese", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "3 eggs", "3 or 4 graham crackers", "2 tablespoons/25 grams unsalted butter", "Chocolate ganache (optional; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1016615/chocolate-ganache.html\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 250 degrees.
