This version skips the food coloring, and instead infuses the candy coating with cinnamon and vanilla. If you're worried about your teeth, serve these by slicing them, rather than trying to take a bite, as the candy coating sets to be quite firm. Be sure to start with room temperature apples as cold apples will cause the candy mixture to harden too quickly making it difficult to work with.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/05/dining/em-candy-apple-horizontal/merlin_141964095_4351daa1-b8a4-4599-a6cf-bb4a9dba0aa7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, candies", "keywords": "apple, corn syrup, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium apples (about 1 1/2 pounds total), such as Granny Smith, McIntosh or Honeycrisp, preferably organic (see note), washed and dried, at room temperature", "4 (8-inch) sturdy treat sticks", "2 cups/405 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters light corn syrup", "1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped, or 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or a piece of lightly greased parchment paper.
