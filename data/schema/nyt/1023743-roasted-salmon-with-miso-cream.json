Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche spread all over the fish keeps it moist as it roasts and adds a savory richness when a dollop of miso is stirred into the mix. That same pair is gently warmed into a sauce that\u2019s finished with tart citrus juice so that it tastes both creamy and light. This can be served simply with salad and bread or be offered with other vegetables, like potatoes, asparagus or brussels sprouts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/21/multimedia/15korex3-salmon-1-a63b/15korex3-salmon-1-a63b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, seafood, main course", "keywords": "christmas, hanukkah, new year\u2019s day, cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche, ichimi togarashi, miso, salmon fillet, turbinado sugar, yuzu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 722}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (2 3/4-pound) whole salmon fillet (skin on or off), patted dry if needed", "Coarse sea or kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ichimi togarashi or ground cayenne", "1 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream (8 ounces)", "2 tablespoons shiro (white) miso (see Tip)", "2 teaspoons turbinado or other coarse raw sugar (optional)", "2 limes", "1 tablespoon yuzu or lime juice", "Toasted white sesame seeds, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
