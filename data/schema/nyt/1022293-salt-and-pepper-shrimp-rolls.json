{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salt and Pepper Shrimp Rolls", "description": "Inspired by jiao yan xia, the classic Chinese dish of head-on, fried shrimp finished with a Sichuan or white pepper salt seasoning, these shrimp rolls celebrate the flavors of salt and pepper. Peeled shrimp are seasoned, breaded with cornstarch and fried until super crunchy, then sprinkled with a black pepper-salt. Once cooked, they\u2019re tucked into toasted rolls smeared with a zingy garlic mayo. Fresh cilantro, sliced chile and a squeeze of fresh lime brighten the hearty sandwich. Store any leftover pepper-salt in an airtight container and use it as a seasoning for roasted meats and vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/kc-salt-and-pepper-shrimp-rolls/kc-salt-and-pepper-shrimp-rolls-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sandwiches, seafood, main course", "keywords": "black pepper, cornstarch, mayonnaise, salt, shrimp, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1655}, "recipeIngredient": ["Vegetable oil, for frying (about 2 1/2 cups)", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "1/4 teaspoon grated garlic", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 hot dog buns, preferably top-split", "1 pound peeled and deveined jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 shrimp), tails removed", "1/4 cup whole (or 2-percent) milk", "1 cup cornstarch", "2 Fresno chiles, thinly sliced", "Tender cilantro sprigs, for garnish", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 12-inch cast-iron or heavy skillet, heat 1 inch of oil over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine mayonnaise and garlic; mix well.
