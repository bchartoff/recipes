{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cornmeal Plum Scones", "description": "Scones with jam is classic. But in most cases the jam is served alongside; here, we\u2019ve baked it right into the pastry. This recipe calls for a whipping up a quickly made plum and honey jam scented with bay leaf (you can substitute a rosemary sprig or cinnamon stick if you\u2019d rather). If that seems like one step too many, use any prepared jam you like, though something on the less sweet side works best. Or bake the cornmeal scones unfilled. They are moist, lightly sweet and perfectly satisfying all on their own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/23/multimedia/clark-cornmeal-scones/clark-cornmeal-scones-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 scones", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack, pastries", "keywords": "cornmeal, plum, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 169}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 376, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "186 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons/45 milliliters honey", "1 bay leaf", "3/4 pound plums/1/3 kilogram, halved, pitted and then cut into 1-inch cubes", "3/4 cup/175 milliliters heavy cream, more as needed", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 2/3 cups/275 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/60 grams fine cornmeal", "3 tablespoons/35 grams sugar", "2 teaspoons/7 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon/2 grams kosher salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter at room temperature, cubed, plus more for serving if you like"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put honey and bay leaf in a medium skillet over medium heat.
