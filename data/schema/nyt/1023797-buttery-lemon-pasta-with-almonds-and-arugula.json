{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttery Lemon Pasta With Almonds and Arugula", "description": "Brown butter, crunchy almonds and tangy lemon make a rich but balanced sauce for this pantry-friendly pasta. The arugula lends freshness and rounds out the pasta, turning this into a quick one-pot meal. If you want to increase the vegetables, you can double the arugula. (Just add a little more lemon juice.) And if you don\u2019t have baby (or wild) arugula on hand, spinach or baby kale are fine, though slightly milder, substitutes. Don\u2019t stint on the red-pepper flakes; their spiciness helps bring together the flavors.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/11/multimedia/05Apperex-pasta-1-2f99/05Apperex-pasta-1-2f99-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "almond, arugula, brown butter, lemon juice, linguine, red pepper flake, rosemary, spaghetti, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1691}, "recipeIngredient": ["Fine salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound linguine or spaghetti", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup sliced almonds", "2 fresh rosemary sprigs", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest", "4 to 5 ounces baby or wild arugula, coarsely chopped, or use baby kale or spinach (4 to 5 cups)", "Grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil.
