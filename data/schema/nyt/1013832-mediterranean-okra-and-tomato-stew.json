{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mediterranean Okra and Tomato Stew", "description": "Until lately, I hadn\u2019t been a fan of okra. But then I learned how cooks in the eastern and southern Mediterranean treat this popular vegetable: they cook it whole, after tossing it with salt and vinegar and marinating it for an hour to make it less, well, slimy. Some regional cooks dry okra in the sun after salting it.Okra is low in calories, very high in dietary fiber, and a great source of vitamin A, vitamin C, B vitamins and the phytonutrients glutathione, xanthin, lutein and beta carotene. For the best texture and flavor, buy the smallest pods you can find. Okra is stewed with tomatoes and onions throughout the Middle East and in Greece, where the vegetable goes by its Arabic name, bamyeh or bamyies. Traditionally, the stews are made with about three times as much olive oil as I use here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/13/science/12recipehealth/12recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves four as a main dish with rice, six as a side", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, okra, onion, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 96}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 268, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1145 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds small okra", "Salt", "1 cup red wine vinegar", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 medium onions, cut in half lengthwise then sliced thin across the grain", "3 to 4 garlic cloves to taste, minced", "1 pound tomatoes, preferably plum tomatoes, seeded and grated, or else peeled, seeded and chopped; or 1 14-ounce can, with juice", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon tomato paste diluted in 1/2 cup water", "1 teaspoon ground allspice", "1 teaspoon sugar", "2 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, to taste", "1/4 cup finely chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the stems off the okra, and place in a large bowl.
