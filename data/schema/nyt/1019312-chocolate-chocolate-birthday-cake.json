After boxed cakes, ice-cream cakes, a cake in a Darth Vader mold (that year, the party\u2019s theme was \u201cMay the Fours Be With You), this cake hit the spot and remains a favorite.\u00a0It\u2019s a double-layer devil\u2019s-food cake made with cocoa and bittersweet chocolate, the same pair that makes the frosting so luscious.\u00a0\u00a0You can make the layers ahead of time, wrap them and freeze them for up to a month.\u00a0\u00a0As for the frosting, it\u2019s best spread between the layers and over the cake when it\u2019s just made.\u00a0Once assembled, the cake can be refrigerated overnight.\u00a0It cuts most easily when it\u2019s cold but tastes best when it\u2019s at room temperature, which is about what it will be once the candles are blown out and the slices put on plates.\u00a0Ice cream alongside is unnecessary but nice.\u00a0Hey, it\u2019s a birthday!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/13/magazine/13OnDessert/13OnDessert-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, buttermilk, confectioners' sugar, unsalted butter, unsweetened cocoa powder, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 982}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 683, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "322 milligrams", "sugarContent": "59 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 sticks (226 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature (plus more for the pan)", "2/3 cup (56 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder (plus more for the pan)", "2 cups (272 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/4 cups (250 grams) sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1 cup (240 ml.) buttermilk, well shaken", "4 ounces (113 grams) bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled", "3 1/3 cups (405 grams) confectioners\u2019 sugar", "4 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 sticks (339 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "6 ounces (170 grams) bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled", "4 1/2 tablespoons buttermilk", "Small decorations to scatter over the cake, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and preheat it to 350.
