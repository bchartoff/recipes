{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Steam Roast", "description": "Traditionally served at wedding banquets in Pakistan, the chicken steam roast has found its way into Punjab\u2019s street food scene, and the recipe is replicated by home cooks all across the country. Marinated chicken legs steam slowly in their own juices in a deep pot with a little bit of fat. A tawa or thin metal griddle (a metal comal would also work) is used to temper heat from the stove so it can be applied evenly and for longer. Steam accumulating in the closed pot raises its temperature high enough to cook the chicken through. Patience and faith are key ingredients in this recipe. Resist checking on the chicken periodically and have some faith in the cooking process; you\u2019ll ultimately be rewarded. The result: tender, flavorful, falling-off-the-bone chicken legs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zainab Shah"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/22/dining/17chickenrex/merlin_194652171_2bbe3336-29a8-4ba2-81ba-449ce2f1904c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "pakistani", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "chicken legs, greek yogurt, thai chili", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 638}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup full-fat Greek yogurt", "1/2 teaspoon paprika", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 teaspoons ground red chile", "1 teaspoon ginger paste or finely grated fresh peeled ginger", "1 teaspoon garlic paste or finely grated fresh garlic", "6 to 8 Thai green chiles, stemmed and chopped", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "6 bone-in chicken legs (3 to 4 pounds), skin removed, meat scored to the bone", "Ghee or neutral oil, for cooking", "Chopped cilantro, chile flakes, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022061\">mint chutney</a> and lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix the yogurt, spices, ginger paste, garlic paste, chopped green chiles and salt in a large bowl to make a pasty marinade.
