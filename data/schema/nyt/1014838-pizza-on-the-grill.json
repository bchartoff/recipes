{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pizza on the Grill", "description": "Pizzas made on the grill are really more like topped flatbreads. They get plenty of direct heat, so the surfaces brown nicely, but not enough ambient heat, even with the lid closed, for a crumb to develop on the rim of the pizza. Stretch out or roll the dough very thin, with no raised edge, so that the pizzas won\u2019t have a doughy texture. It\u2019s much easier to work with smaller pies, and it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t weigh down your pizzas with ingredients, especially marinara sauce, or they\u2019ll be difficult to get on and off the grill and they\u2019ll be soggy. A thin layer of marinara \u2014 1/4 cup \u2014  will be plenty for a 10-inch disk.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/01/science/01recipehealth/01recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "3 10-inch pizzas", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pizza and calzones", "keywords": "halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 615, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "90 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "719 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 grams (2 teaspoons) active dry or fresh yeast", "225 grams (1 cup) warm water", "5 grams (1 teaspoon) sugar", "12 1/2 grams (1 tablespoon) extra virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing the \n\n\n\npizza crusts", "185 grams (approximately 1 1/2 cups) whole wheat flour", "125 to 185 grams (approximately 1 to 1 1/2 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour", "10 grams (1 1/4 teaspoons) salt", "3/4 cup marinara sauce made with fresh or canned tomatoes", "5 to 6 ounces mozzarella, shredded if fresh, sliced if low-moisture", "Fresh basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer, or in a large bread bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water.
