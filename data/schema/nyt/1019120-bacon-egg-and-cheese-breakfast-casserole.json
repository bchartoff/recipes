{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bacon, Egg and Cheese Breakfast Casserole", "description": "Falling somewhere between a frittata and a tortilla espa\u00f1ola, this breakfast casserole has everything you love about a classic bacon, egg and cheese sandwich: smoky bacon, perfectly set eggs, sharp Cheddar and, if you want (and you definitely do), tangy hot sauce. Thinly sliced potatoes are added for structure and heft, and cooking them will be the most time-consuming part of this whole dish. The great news is that it\u2019s as delicious (if not more so) the next day, rewarmed or not. If you like, you can bake the casserole the night before and refrigerate, covered, when cool. To reheat, cover with foil and place in a 325-degree oven until warmed through, 25 to 30 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/24/dining/ar-bacon-egg-cheese-casserole-2/ar-bacon-egg-cheese-casserole-2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 619}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 572, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "692 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound thick-cut bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, unpeeled, sliced 1/4-inch thick or cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced into rings", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "10 large eggs", "6 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar or Monterey Jack", "Hot sauce (optional)\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
