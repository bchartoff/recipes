{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Savory Suzhou Mooncakes", "description": "Mooncakes are pastries timed to the Mid-Autumn Festival, a holiday that celebrates the commencement of the harvest season, and this variety is specific to Suzhou, China, a city on the outskirts of Shanghai. Stuffed with juicy ground pork, these savory, glazed mooncakes burst with the flavor of sweetened soy sauce. The shells are crisp and flaky, a texture achieved by layering then rolling two types of dough with lard. This recipe comes from \u201cMy Shanghai: Recipes and Stories From a City on the Water\u201d by Betty Liu, whose mom made them each year when autumn rolled around. Traditionally, the pastries are cooked on the stovetop in a giant cast-iron skillet, but popping them into the oven ensures an even bake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clarissa Wei"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/dining/03MOONCAKEREX2-savory-suzhou-mooncakes/merlin_194033442_06251b50-f70f-4a20-a77d-3a747533dbe0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "16 mooncakes", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "pork", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 159}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large scallion, trimmed", "1 thin (2 1/2-inch-long) slice ginger, plus 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger", "1/2 pound/225 grams ground pork", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine", "1 tablespoon light soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons dark soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon sesame oil", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "Pinch of ground white pepper", "1 cup plus 3 tablespoons/158 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/110 grams pork lard or softened unsalted butter", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "3 tablespoons pork lard or softened unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Pinch of kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters boiling water, plus more as needed", "1 large egg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the filling: In a blender, blend the scallion, sliced ginger and 1/4 cup water on high until pur\u00e9ed.
