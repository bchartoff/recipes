{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Vegetables", "description": "The key to roasting all kinds of vegetables is to know the right temperature for cooking them. Dense, low-moisture vegetables (like the roots and squashes in this recipe) need lower heat and more time in the oven than vegetables with more moisture, like eggplant or zucchini. Then simply toss your vegetables with oil and season with salt and pepper before roasting. Top your roasted vegetable with a couple of fried eggs or a dollop of yogurt, or both, and you have a meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/23/dining/23ROASTEDVEGETABLES/23ROASTEDVEGETABLES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, vegetables", "keywords": "egg, root vegetables, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 863}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 pounds root or dense vegetable, peeled if you like and cut into 1-inch chunks or wedges (carrots, beets, potatoes, sweet potatoes, turnips, radishes, rutabaga, winter squashes)", "Oil (olive, coconut or grapeseed)", "Salt and pepper", "Fried eggs and/or plain yogurt", "Fresh herbs, torn or chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
