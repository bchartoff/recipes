This is a snacking cake, mighty sweet, which benefits from a cup of coffee or another bitter drink to cut through the sugar. It might remind you of Jamaican black cake. Pour some rum on top if you so desire.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jean Hewitt"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/12recipemess1/merlin_173126490_e160dbc9-db8a-4f28-8008-64b7d7caabe4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "48 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "buttermilk, carrot, carrot cake, crushed pineapple, flaked coconut, mother\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 126}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams flour", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams sugar", "2 teaspoons cinnamon", "3 eggs", "3/4 cup/175 milliliters buttermilk", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters oil", "2 teaspoons vanilla", "1 (8 ounce/225 grams) can crushed pineapple", "2 cups/250 grams finely grated raw carrots (there should not be any liquid)", "1 cup/120 grams coarsely chopped nuts", "1 cup/85 grams unsweetened flaked coconut", "2/3 cup/135 grams sugar", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters buttermilk", "1/3 cup/75 grams butter", "2 tablespoons light corn syrup", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sift the flour, baking soda, salt, sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl.
