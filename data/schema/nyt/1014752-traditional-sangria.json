{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Traditional Sangria", "description": "Rafael Mateo, the proprietor of Pata Negra, a Spanish wine bar in the East Village, formulated this sangria that is winelike and very refreshing, with a keen balance of tart and fruity flavors. \n\nUnlike many recipes, which specify Rioja made from the tempranillo grape, Mr. Mateo prefers using garnacha from Campo de Borja in central Spain, which he said has backbone without being overly tannic. He lightens the blend by adding ros\u00e9, and sweetens it with orange liqueur and orange soda rather than with fruit pur\u00e9e, a common addition, which he dislikes because, he said, it gives the sangria a grainy texture. He experimented with orange juice rather than soda, but found it, too, changed the texture. Finally, he allows the punch to knit together overnight and adds cut fruit only at the end, as a garnish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Asimov"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20HIT_TRADITIONALSANGRIA/20HIT_TRADITIONALSANGRIA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "10 1/2 cups (about 16 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, editors' pick", "keywords": "dry rosado, orange soda, red wine, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 532}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 145, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "9 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 bottles dry garnacha red wine", "1 bottle dry rosado (Spanish ros\u00e9)", "12 ounces orange soda (preferably a less-sweet brand such as Spanish KAS or San Pellegrino aranciata, or use Fanta)", "1 ounce Torres orange liqueur or Triple Sec", "2 ounces Romate or other Spanish brandy", "1 tablespoon sugar, or to taste", "2 apples, cored and diced, for garnish", "2 oranges, cut into wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large vessel, combine all liquid ingredients.
