{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Thighs With Sour Cherries and Cucumber Yogurt", "description": "If you\u2019re lucky enough to have more sour cherries than you need to make a pie, save them for this sweet and tangy chicken dish. The cherries are briefly simmered with sugar, vinegar and a bay leaf, then added to a sheet pan to roast alongside boneless, skinless chicken thighs and wedges of red onion. As they cook, the cherries absorb the chicken juices, becoming very savory and concentrated. Then, the whole thing is topped with dollops of cooling cucumber yogurt. Serve it with bread or rice to catch the juices at the bottom of the pan.\u00a0If you can\u2019t get sour cherries, you can substitute seedless red or green grapes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/08/dining/08apperex-chicken/merlin_209335341_90e39ff5-c889-4f67-b328-677fa649f197-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, cucumber, sour cherry, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 571}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 2 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1 large red onion, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch wedges", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons minced tarragon, plus more for serving", "2 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1/3 cup unseasoned rice vinegar", "3 to 4 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 bay leaf", "2 cups thinly sliced cucumbers, preferably Persian cucumbers", "2 cups sour cherries, stemmed and\u00a0pitted", "1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt", "Flaky sea salt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
