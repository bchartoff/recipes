Add the garlic, and continue to cook the mushrooms, stirring often, until they have softened a little more, about two minutes. Add the reconstituted dried mushrooms, the wine and rosemary (or thyme), and turn the heat to high. Cook, stirring often, until the wine evaporates and the pan is almost dry, five to 10 minutes. Stir in the mushroom broth.
