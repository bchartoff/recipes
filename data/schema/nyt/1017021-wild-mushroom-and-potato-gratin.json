{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wild Mushroom and Potato Gratin", "description": "Wild mushrooms add a luxurious dimension to this comforting, almost classic potato gratin. There is no cream here, just milk mixed with porcini broth (the result of soaking dried porcinis for 30 minutes in boiling water). You can use a mix of wild mushrooms, or just one type. Saut\u00e9 them with onion or shallots, garlic and savory herbs (thyme and rosemary or sage), season them well and toss with the potatoes. The gratin requires 1 1/2 hours in the oven; first you will doubt that all of the liquid will be absorbed by the potatoes, and about halfway through you will be convinced that the finished dish will be watery and the potatoes hard. But by the end, once all the bubbling has subsided, the soft potatoes will have imbibed all of the flavorful liquid in the dish, and the top and edges of the gratin will be crusty, the way a gratin should be.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/02/science/03recipehealth/03recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "french, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, winter, gluten-free, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 157}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 242, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "594 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 ounce (about 1/2 cup) dried porchinis", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 pound wild mushrooms, torn into smaller pieces if large, cleaned if necessary", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion or 2 shallots, minced", "2 garlic cloves, minced, plus 1/2 garlic clove, intact", "1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves, chopped", "1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary or sage", "Salt", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, golden potatoes or Yukon golds, scrubbed, peeled if desired, and sliced about 1/4 inch thick", "1 cup, tightly packed, grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese (4 ounces )", "Salt to taste", "Freshly ground pepper", "2-1/2 cups milk (whole or 2 percent)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the dried porcinis in a bowl or a pyrex measuring cup and pour on 1 1/2 cups boiling water.
