It\u2019s piquant, juicy and on the lighter side of a beefy main course.\u00a0Tenderloin works best here, but it's not generally considered kosher, so if you are making it for Passover, Rosh Hashana or another Jewish holiday, use a boneless rib roast or center cut London broil.  The magenta-colored beet horseradish keeps in the fridge for weeks, and it's also great on roast beef sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/08/multimedia/clark-beef-tenderloin/clark-beef-tenderloin-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beef stock, beef tenderloin, beet, horseradish root, root vegetables, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 54}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds center-cut beef tenderloin, boneless rib roast or center-cut London broil, trimmed", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated on a microplane or mashed", "3 large leeks, white and light green parts, trimmed, halved lengthwise and rinsed", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "5 cups mixed root vegetables, such as parsnip, carrot, turnip, celery root and rutabaga, trimmed, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch chunks (1 1/2 pounds trimmed)", "10 smashed and peeled garlic cloves", "6 cups good-quality beef stock (or chicken stock in a pinch)", "1 small bunch thyme, tied with kitchen twine", "1 bay leaf", "Lemon juice, as needed", "Coarse sea salt, as needed", "Chopped chives, for garnish", "1 medium horseradish root (about 10 ounces), peeled and cut into large chunks", "1 small raw beet, peeled", "2/3 cup white wine vinegar", "1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 large egg yolk, at room temperature", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the beef: Pat the beef dry and season all over with salt, pepper, lemon zest and grated garlic.
