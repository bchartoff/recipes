Adapted from \u201cMadhur Jaffrey\u2019s Instantly Indian Cookbook\u201d (Knopf, 2019), this recipe is a relatively fast way to a rich, satisfying dish. You can make your own garam masala (see Tip), or simply use store-bought. Don\u2019t skip the tarka: Thinly sliced onions are cooked in ghee until deep in color and then tossed with paprika and chile powder, adding a bright flavor that cuts through the rich dal. Serve it with Indian flatbreads, like naan, roti or parathas, though Ms. Jaffrey also recommends whole-wheat pita.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Krysten Chambrot"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/kc-buttery-dal/merlin_161002911_021cc13f-b34d-4748-a06a-4026265dea68-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, soups and stews", "keywords": "garam masala, ginger, heavy cream, red kidney beans, tomatoes, urad, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 190}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup whole urad with skin (sabut ma)", "1/2 cup dried red kidney beans (rajma)", "1 cup pur\u00e9ed or strained tomatoes, or passata", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated (about 4 teaspoons)", "1 large garlic clove, crushed", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon chile powder, such as ground cayenne, to taste", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1 teaspoon garam masala (see Tip)", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons peanut oil or ghee", "1/2 small onion, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "1/4 teaspoon ground paprika", "1/4 teaspoon chile powder, such as ground cayenne"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the beans: Wash urad and beans, and soak them overnight at room temperature, in water that covers them generously.
