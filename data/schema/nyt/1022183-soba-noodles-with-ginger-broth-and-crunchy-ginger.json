{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soba Noodles With Ginger Broth and Crunchy Ginger", "description": "This noodle dish celebrates the pungent, spicy notes of ginger by both infusing it in stock to create a warming broth and frying it with shallots and panko to create crunchy ginger crumbs you\u2019ll want to sprinkle onto everything: eggs, rice or even a savory porridge. Feel free to double the amount of the ginger crumbs, if you like; they\u2019ll keep in an airtight jar at room temperature for up to one week.
