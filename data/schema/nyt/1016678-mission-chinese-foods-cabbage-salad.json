{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mission Chinese Food\u2019s Cabbage Salad", "description": "Danny Bowien, the chef and an owner of Mission Chinese Food in San Francisco and sometimes New York, wanted to have a Chinese version of Caesar salad on his menu. The dish that he  and Angela Dimayuga, his executive chef, came up with is not Chinese in the least. Nor does it owe anything to Caesar save for a tin of anchovies. It is instead a Japanese ode to umami, the mysterious fifth flavor beyond sweet and salty, bitter and sour. Miso, tahini, soy sauce and dried seaweed provide a riot of flavors, and fried kasha and the raw vegetables provide copious crunch. Serve the dish alongside simple grilled chicken or pork, with a bowl of white rice. These don't even have to be all that good. You could serve this recipe alongside a teriyaki-glazed laptop case and receive plaudits for the meal. Don't have one of the ingredients? Omit! \u2018\u2018If you don\u2019t have it, leave it out,\u2019\u2019 Bowien said in an interview. \u2018\u2018It still works.\u2019\u2019", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/27/magazine/27eat/27eat-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "anchovies, beet, cabbage", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 282}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 head red cabbage", "1 medium-size beet, ideally\ncandy-striped", "Juice of 1 lemon", "1 teaspoon dried hijiki seaweed", "1 teaspoon ume vinegar or\nred-wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons sweet white-miso paste", "3 tablespoons tahini", "1 teaspoon unseasoned rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon shiro shoyu or\nlight soy sauce", "8 anchovy fillets, coarsely chopped", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola", "1/2 cup kasha", "2 tablespoons aonori seaweed, green\nseaweed or finely shredded nori", "3 tablespoons toasted white\nsesame seeds", "1 tablespoon shio kombu or salted\nkombu, optional", "Pinch of salt, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut cabbage in half, and remove core.
