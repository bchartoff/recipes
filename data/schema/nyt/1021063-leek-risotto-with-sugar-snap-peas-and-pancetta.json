During the cooking process, the rice should always be lightly coated in liquid and bubbling energetically, and the liquid needs to be added gradually: Add just before the rice threatens to stick to the bottom of the pan. For the creamiest results, stir more frequently and more vigorously during the second half of the cooking, when the grains begin to release their starch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/07/dining/ss-leek-risottao/merlin_172221669_c4cc9d42-4e88-43eb-a1e9-0497b7515c91-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, main course", "keywords": "arborio rice, chicken stock, leek, pancetta, pecorino, snap peas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 979}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil", "3 ounces thinly sliced pancetta or bacon", "1 quart chicken stock", "3 large leeks, white parts only, split lengthwise, sliced 1/4-inch thick and thoroughly washed (about 3 cups)", "2 garlic cloves, smashed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 cups arborio rice", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 ounces grated Pecorino (about 3/4 cup), plus more for topping", "8 ounces sugar snap peas, strings removed, snap peas halved lengthwise", "1/2 cup snipped chives (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add 1/2 tablespoon oil to a large, wide saucepan, and add the pancetta slices.
