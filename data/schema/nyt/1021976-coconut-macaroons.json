{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Macaroons", "description": "If you are a coconut lover, you\u2019ll want to make these moist, chewy macaroons all the time. Crisp on the outside and pillowy within, they take only a few minutes to put together and keep extremely well. Their perfect texture comes from fluffy sweetened coconut for softness and crunchier unsweetened coconut for more chewiness. Coconut flour, ubiquitous now because of gluten-free baking, is very absorbent and works beautifully to absorb the extra liquid that would otherwise run out of the macaroon, but matzo cake meal can be used during Passover and all-purpose flour any other time of year. Just double check that whatever you use is kosher for Passover.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/dining/12Passoverrex5/merlin_184703217_f97e0064-aad5-41e1-b250-5b7ba27e90c3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "About 18 macaroons", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "chocolate, coconut, egg whites, passover", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 655}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large egg whites", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/151 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon melted virgin coconut oil or neutral oil, like safflower or grapeseed", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or seeds from 1/2 vanilla bean (see Tips)", "1 1/2 cups/128 grams sweetened flaked coconut (see Tips)", "1 1/2 cups/128 grams shredded unsweetened coconut", "2 tablespoons coconut flour, matzo cake meal or all-purpose flour (see Tips)", "4 ounces/113.5 grams bittersweet chocolate, chopped", "Flaky salt, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position racks in the top and bottom of the oven and heat oven to 325 degrees.
