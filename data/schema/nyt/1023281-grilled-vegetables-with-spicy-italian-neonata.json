{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Vegetables With Spicy Italian Neonata", "description": "Summer squash, bell peppers, eggplant and greens are the stars of this greenmarket grill party. The spicy vibrant finishing sauce is inspired by Calabrian neonata, a preserved condiment made with hot peppers and baby fish. The condiment is often drizzled onto pasta, pizza or grilled bread. Here, briny anchovies, salami and olives season the sauce with salty, meaty notes to contrast with the spicy pickled cherry peppers and cool, crunchy celery. The fiery, tangy dressing, which can be made a few hours ahead, provides a lively boost for the smoky, tender veggies. Leftover neonata keeps for a week and makes a great sandwich topping the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/27/dining/kc-summer-vegetables-with-neonata/merlin_209008500_b1ed1b2a-3ffd-496a-b304-80be3da23024-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, bell pepper, eggplant, lettuce, olives, zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 279}, "recipeIngredient": ["Neutral oil, for greasing", "4 bell peppers of any color (2 pounds), halved, seeded and sliced into 1-inch strips\u00a0", "3 zucchini (1 1/2 pounds), sliced 1/4-inch thick on the diagonal\u00a0", "3 Italian baby eggplants (1 1/2 pounds), sliced lengthwise 1/4-inch thick", "1 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "3 heads sturdy lettuce, such as romaine or radicchio, quartered through the core", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "5 anchovy fillets, minced into a paste", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 1/2 ounces sliced salami or soppressata, finely chopped (about \u2153 cup)", "1/2 cup jarred sliced hot cherry peppers, finely chopped", "1/2 cup pitted manzanilla or Cerignola olives, chopped", "2 celery stalks, finely chopped (1 cup)", "1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a grill to medium and oil the grates.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On two large sheet pans, divide bell peppers, zucchini and eggplant.
