{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Cherry-Pistachio Salad With Charred Scallion Vinaigrette", "description": "The experience of biting into a juicy black cherry embodies summer. For cherry recipes, dessert may come to mind first, but how about something savory? Bursting bites of cherry star in this five-ingredient salad, with scallions, pistachios, oil and vinegar. The recipe puts scallions to work in two ways: Their raw greens bring bright, grassy notes, while the charred bottoms bring sweetness and bitterness when pulverized into paste. Raw, coarse chopped pistachio lends an interesting chew that develops into a complex fat for the salad. This salad is elegant and simple \u2014 and deserves to be among your new summer classics. Use your best extra-virgin olive oil, and try adding fresh, organic rose petals to the dish for a delicate strawberry-rose flavor, and a Baroque, sensual layering of flavors.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Angela Dimayuga"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/dining/27Cherryrex/merlin_174807387_f56121da-3993-46ec-ac6c-985e88a80402-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings, side dish", "keywords": "apple cider vinegar, cherries, cherry, pistachio, scallion, sea salt, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 639}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds black cherries, washed", "1/2 cup raw pistachios (about 3 ounces)", "1 bunch scallions", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Ice water, as needed", "Flaky sea salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a knife, score all the cherries in half at the seam.
