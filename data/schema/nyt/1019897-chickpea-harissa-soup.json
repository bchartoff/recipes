Harissa, a North African chile paste, packs a punch right out of the jar (brands range in heat levels, though, so adjust quantity to taste). Dump in 2 cans of chickpeas: The starchy, seasoned liquid thickens the soup quickly. Besides that, additional vegetables and toppings you want to add are up to you: Soup should bend to your life, not the opposite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/07/dining/as-harissa-soup/as-harissa-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, beans, soups and stews", "keywords": "chickpea, harissa, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 972}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 393, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "609 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large yellow onion, diced (about 1/2 cup)", "1 large carrot, diced (about 1/4 cup)", "Kosher salt", "6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 to 2 tablespoons harissa, or to taste", "2 (14-ounce) cans chickpeas", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Honey, to taste (optional)", "Toppings (optional): More lemon juice, celery, celery leaves, herbs (cilantro, parsley, mint), capers, pitted olives, croutons or bread crumbs, soft-boiled egg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat.
