{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soba Salad", "description": "For most people, even experienced cooks, weeknight dinners are not so much a result of careful planning but of what\u2019s on hand \u2014 and what can be accomplished fairly quickly.  Noodles of all kinds are easy and beloved. But soba noodles, a Japanese staple, are special: they usually take no more than 3 to 4 minutes to cook and, because they\u2019re made from buckwheat, have a slightly firm texture and a nutty flavor. Traditionally, soba are served hot and cold, making them a flexible partner for almost any fresh ingredients you have in the kitchen. In this case, they are paired with shelled frozen edamame, carrots and spinach and a light dressing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/11/dining/mb-soba-salad/mb-soba-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "quick, salads and dressings, times classics", "keywords": "main course, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1096}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1134 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "3 to 4 ounces soba noodles", "1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped", "2 cups edamame (frozen are fine)", "2 to 3 tablespoons soy sauce", "Juice of one lime", "2 tablespoons white or light miso", "1 tablespoon mirin or 1 teaspoon sugar, or to taste", "1 10-ounce package fresh spinach, washed and trimmed", "1/4 cup chopped scallion", "1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it.
