{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Home Fries", "description": "The great thing about this recipe is that it can be cooked in just one skillet \u2014 and it eliminates the time-consuming task of blanching your potatoes first. Water, oil and salt are combined in one pan. Once the potatoes enter the skillet, the lid is added and the potatoes steam, cooking evenly and absorbing the flavors of the salt and oil. Once the lid comes off, the water evaporates yet the oil remains, so the potatoes pan-fry until crispy. The results? Crunchy home fries with pillowy centers. If cooking for a crowd, double or triple the recipe, but do cook in batches, to avoid crowding the pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Roze Traore"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/22/dining/rt-home-fries-1/merlin_211376484_288da972-64e9-4b89-9f2b-6ed6bae0f03a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings (about 1 1/4 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, for two, quick, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "cast iron, yukon gold potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 350}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup vegetable oil", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 medium Yukon Gold potato (about 7 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the oil, salt and 1/3 cup water to a medium cast-iron skillet; whisk to combine."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the potato cubes in an even layer.
