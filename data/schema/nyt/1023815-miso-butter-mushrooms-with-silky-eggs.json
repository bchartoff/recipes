{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso-Butter Mushrooms With Silky Eggs", "description": "This dish brings all-day breakfast vibes. The earthy, robust flavors of mushrooms are intensified with an unapologetically savory miso butter. (Tip: Make extra and store in the fridge to season roasted veggies or noodles.) Leaving the mushrooms whole saves preparation time and also ensures that they remain plump and juicy inside. The silky eggs are made like Australian cafe-style scrambled eggs, where they are barely cooked, for only seconds, resulting in a custardy finish. If you are looking for some greenery, stir spinach leaves through the hot mushrooms and let the residual heat wilt them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/09/multimedia/hm-miso-butter-mushrooms-lqcz/hm-miso-butter-mushrooms-lqcz-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "egg, egg dish, garlic, miso, mushroom, sesame seeds, unsalted butter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 154}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "24 ounces small cremini or button mushrooms, brushed clean and trimmed\u00a0", "2 tablespoons white miso paste", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened at room temperature for 10 minutes", "2 garlic cloves, grated\u00a0", "1 tablespoon toasted white sesame seeds (optional)", "6 large eggs\u00a0", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "4 to 8 slices of bread, toasted, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the mushrooms: Heat a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over medium high.

Continue to push the eggs in a circular motion for 5 to 10 seconds, just until the center is slightly wet looking and the egg looks rippled. The whole process only takes about 20 to 30 seconds.
