{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saut\u00e9ed Salmon With Leeks and Tomatoes", "description": "Here is a fresh and simple way to prepare salmon that is ready in about 20 minutes. Most of that time will be spent preparing the vegetables. You do have to blanch, core and chop the tomatoes, but that is quick work. (We won't tell if you use the canned, diced sort instead. Just drain them first.) Once that's done, saut\u00e9 the fish and set aside. Throw tomatoes, leeks, lemon juice and freshly ground pepper into the pan and saut\u00e9 for a quick minute. Spoon over the fish and serve.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/salmon-with-leeks-and-tomato/salmon-with-leeks-and-tomato-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "leek, salmon fillet, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 795}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 489, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "889 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 skinless, boneless salmon fillets, about 1 1/2 pounds, at room temperature", "Salt to taste", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 leek, well trimmed", "2 or 3 red ripe tomatoes, about 1 1/2 pounds", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander or basil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If there are any bones in the salmon, pull them out with tweezers and discard.
