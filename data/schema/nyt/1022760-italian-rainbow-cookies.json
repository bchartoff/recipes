{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Italian Rainbow Cookies", "description": "Also known as Venetians, Neapolitans or tricolore cookies, these classic Italian-American treats are not really cookies at all, but thin, dense layers of brightly hued almond cake stacked with apricot jam, and coated with glossy chocolate. The layers are traditionally red, white and green to resemble the Italian flag, but, of course, you can play around with the colors depending on the holiday and what you have on hand. This version is adapted from Mary Carpino, from Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., who made them every Christmas for years. One of her granddaughters, Nicole Carpino Frasco, passed along the recipe to us. We increased the chocolate and salt slightly, but the festive spirit of the recipe remains. Mrs. Carpino stored them in her chilly winter attic, but if you don\u2019t have one of those, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, or in the freezer for up to 5 months.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08COOKIESREX19-RAINBOW/merlin_198248880_6e35a7d0-8dcf-4f9c-81f4-9166a0059a5b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 70 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bar cookie, christmas cookie, italian american, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 700}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray or neutral oil, for greasing the pans", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "1 (8-ounce/227-gram) package pure almond paste (not pastry filling) (see Tip)", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 cup/201 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, yolks and whites separated", "1 teaspoon almond extract", "Red and green food coloring, preferably gel", "1 (12-ounce/340-gram) jar apricot or raspberry preserves (not seedless)", "8 ounces/227 grams semisweet or bittersweet bar chocolate", "Sprinkles, for finishing (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange 2 racks in the center of the oven and heat to 350 degrees.
