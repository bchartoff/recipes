{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Condensed Milk Pound Cake", "description": "A dulce de leche swirl adds caramel sweetness to this light, moist pound cake, adapted from Margarita Manzke of R\u00e9publique in Los Angeles. Although Ms. Manzke makes her own dulce de leche, the jarred kind works just as well here, especially after being marbled into the vanilla-scented, buttery batter. This cake is best served within 2 days of baking. Store it, well-wrapped, in the refrigerator, then bring it to room temperature before serving to best appreciate its gentle flavors.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/dining/03bakingbookrex3/merlin_164785293_4b308a23-cfee-4ed2-9312-686e404d62ac-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, dulce de leche, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla bean", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 274}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature, plus more for greasing", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 cup plus 4 teaspoons/200 milliliters sweetened condensed milk", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "Seeds from 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 2/3 cups/215 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters dulce de leche"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
