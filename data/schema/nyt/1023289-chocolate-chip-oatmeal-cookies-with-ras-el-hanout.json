{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate-Chip Oatmeal Cookies With Ras el Hanout", "description": "Everyone loves a good oatmeal cookie \u2014 and this one will take you straight to Morocco. Ras el hanout is a common Moroccan spice blend and translates to \u201ctop of the shop\u201d in Moroccan Arabic, which suggests that the spices selected were the finest available in the merchant's shop at the moment. The fragrant and warming spices of ras el hanout pair beautifully with the sweetness of the oatmeal cookie and the sharpness of the dark chocolate. Because of the spice mixture, these cookies won't appear to brown much, so be careful not to overbake. You can use your favorite store-bought ras el hanout for your cookies or make your own blend (see tip).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nargisse Benkabbou"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/28/dining/nb-ras-el-hanout-cookies/nb-ras-el-hanout-cookies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "about 2 dozen cookies\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "chocolate chips, oats, ras el hanout", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 711}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 packed cup/146 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature", "1 large egg", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams old-fashioned rolled oats", "1 cup/120 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon ras el hanout (see Tip)", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/190 grams semisweet chocolate chips or chunks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the sugar, butter, egg and vanilla in a large bowl, and use a handheld electric whisk or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment to mix all ingredients until smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the oats, flour, ras el hanout, baking soda and salt; mix on a low speed until everything is just incorporated, about 30 seconds.
