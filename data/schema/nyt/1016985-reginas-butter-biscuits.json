She mixes traditional French culinary training with tricks passed on through generations of Southern bakers to create a layered, rich biscuit that has to be frozen to be at its flaky best. The dough will seem rough and the fat too chunky at first, but persevere. Using a tea towel as a base to move and manage the dough until it rolls out smoothly is a brilliant technique that makes the whole process easier and neater.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/dining/JPPREPARE3/JPPREPARE3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "3 dozen 2-inch biscuits, 12 servings marmalade butter", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, breads, quick breads", "keywords": "butter, buttermilk, marmalade, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 623}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 549, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "667 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "5 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/480 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/41 grams baking powder", "1/4 cup/50 grams sugar", "1/2 cup/120 grams (1 stick) salted butter, chilled and cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 1/2 cups/360 grams (3 sticks) salted margarine, chilled and cut into 2-inch cubes", "1 3/4 cups/420 milliliters buttermilk, chilled", "1/2 cup (1 stick)/120 grams salted butter, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons sweet orange marmalade"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the biscuits:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put flour, baking powder and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment.
