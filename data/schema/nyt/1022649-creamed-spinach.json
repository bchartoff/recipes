{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamed Spinach", "description": "The incredible mound of spinach called for here (3 pounds!) deflates quickly after an initial blanching, which helps maintain its deep green color. Shallots and garlic lend sweetness, while a mix of milk and heavy cream provides richness without being too heavy. Finally, tangy sour cream lifts and balances the dish. The spinach can be blanched, cooled and chopped a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator. Leftovers make a great omelet or quiche filling, and are also a terrific addition to pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/15/dining/kc-creamed-spinach/merlin_197626134_8eb94b90-0f55-4c02-857e-c22b97be3fb1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "christmas, thanksgiving, cream, milk, spinach, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 719}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds adult spinach (from five 10-ounce bags), tough stems removed", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup finely chopped shallot", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 cup whole milk", "1 cup heavy cream", "Salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup sour cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, bring \u00bd inch of water to a boil over high.
