{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bacon and Onion Pasta", "description": "Building off of the simple but powerfully flavorful Italian dish pasta aglio, olio e peperoncino\u200b\u200b, this wondrous pantry recipe gets much of its flavor from bacon fat and caramelized onions. The one-two-three punch of spicy red-pepper flakes, aromatic garlic slivers and savory herbes de Provence bloomed in fat provides the umami-rich base for this easy workday meal. Red vermouth creates a rich, jammy pasta sauce edged with sweetness. Don\u2019t sleep on angel hair pasta: It\u2019s got the right airy bounciness that\u2019s excellent at soaking up seasonings. Threaded with parsley and Parmesan, these generously oiled noodles are a dream to eat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/23/dining/EK-bacon-onion-vermouth-pasta-3/merlin_202627683_c598fe54-e410-4db6-a52f-9717173f3ad9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 863}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces bacon", "2 medium red onions", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 garlic cloves", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon herbes de Provence", "1 cup sweet red vermouth (vermouth rouge)", "1 pound angel hair or capellini", "1 cup finely chopped fresh parsley", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Take the bacon out of its packaging with the slices still stuck together and place on a cutting board.
