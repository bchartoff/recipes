It is almost literally a mashup: a meal that is kind of Korean, kind of Chinese, kind of Italian. If you don\u2019t like spicy food, use miso instead of the gochujang and don\u2019t use Sichuan peppercorns. (If you like really spicy food, add dried chiles or hot pepper flakes to the recipe at the point you add the gochujang.) And if you want to make it even more luxe than it is already, follow the lead of Chang\u2019s crew and stir 6 ounces of silken tofu into the sauce at the end.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/06/magazine/06eat/06mag-06eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 4-6", "recipeCuisine": "chinese, italian, korean", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "kale, pork, rice cakes, sichuan peppercorns, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1378}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 754, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "107 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "484 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola", "2 large onions, peeled and sliced", "Pinch of kosher salt, or to taste", "1 pound ground pork", "4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped", "10-15 frozen cylindrical rice cakes (optional), or rice noodles, or pasta, or steamed rice", "1 inch fresh ginger, peeled and chopped", "3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chili-bean paste)", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1 tablespoon brown sugar", "2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns (optional)", "1 bunch kale or any hearty cooking greens, roughly chopped", "4 scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a wok set over medium-high heat.
