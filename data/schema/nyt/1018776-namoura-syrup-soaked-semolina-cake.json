{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Namoura (Syrup-Soaked Semolina Cake)", "description": "Amanda Saab, a social worker and home cook who lives near Detroit, riffs on her Lebanese grandmother's recipe for namoura, a cake made from semolina flour, soaked in syrup while it's still warm. When she serves it at iftar dinners during Ramadan, Ms. Saab often doses the syrup with a little bit of lavender extract. You could follow her lead, or use another floral note like vanilla or rose. The cake has no eggs, but this version gets its rich flavor and texture from aerated yogurt, which goes bubbly within minutes of being mixed with a little baking soda.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/26/dining/31ramadanrex1-1/31ramadanrex1-1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "20 to 24 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, semolina flour, slivered almonds, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 278}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 247, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "149 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 1/4 teaspoons lavender extract, vanilla extract or rose water\u00a0", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), melted, plus more for coating the pan", "3 cups/490 grams semolina flour", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/227 grams plain whole-milk yogurt", "2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda", "1/4 cup/29 grams slivered almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan over high heat, boil sugar and 1 cup/240 milliliters of water, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
