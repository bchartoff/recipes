That\u2019s because it\u2019s a dairy-free version of the familiar bright-orange cheesy dip. The recipe is adapted from the cookbook \u201cAm\u00e1: A Modern Tex-Mex Kitchen\u201d by the chef Josef Centeno, whose Los Angeles restaurant serves Tex-Mex classics and modern variations. Though the texture of processed cheese is impossible to replicate, this cashew dip is delightfully creamy with layers of complex flavor. For best results, make sure to thoroughly toast the cashews, char the vegetables and blend until the dip is completely smooth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/dining/tr-cashew-queso/merlin_160427208_4d6b367b-aeea-4850-a891-098560678505-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, burritos and nachos, condiments, dips and spreads, finger foods", "keywords": "almond milk, cashew, chipotles in adobo, cilantro, tomatillo, turmeric, appetizer, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 222}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces tomatillos, husked and rinsed", "1 serrano chile", "1 shallot", "3 garlic cloves", "Fine sea salt", "1/2 bunch cilantro, coarsely chopped", "1 cup raw cashews", "1 chipotle pepper in adobo", "3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups unsweetened almond milk", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon finely chopped red onion, for garnish", "1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro, for garnish", "Tortilla chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the salsa: Put the tomatillos, chile, shallot and garlic on a foil-lined baking sheet and sprinkle with salt.
