{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mackerel With Lemon Olive Oil and Tomatoes", "description": "Mackerel is a sustainable, velvety, sweet-tasting fish that deserves more attention than it usually gets. Here, the pale fillets are roasted on a bed of fragrant basil leaves with a lemon zest-infused olive oil, chopped olives and juicy cherry tomatoes.\u00a0If you have a bottle of cold-pressed lemon olive oil on hand, you can use it here in place of making your own. If infusing your own oil, feel free to use either a regular lemon or a Meyer lemon. Leftover lemon oil is great on salads, tossed with vegetables, or drizzled over avocado toast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/dining/29appetite1/merlin_130340945_15de95a9-74f2-48b9-97cf-ec6c0067cc95-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, lemon, mackerel, olive oil, olives, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 405, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "605 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Finely grated zest of 1 large lemon (save naked lemon for garnish)", "6 to 8 large basil leaves, plus more for garnish", "1 1/2 pounds Atlantic mackerel fillets, or use cod or black sea bass (tautog) if unavailable", "Fine sea salt and black pepper, to taste", "1 to 2 tablespoons lemon olive oil, more as needed", "3/4 cup olives, preferably a mix of green and black, pitted and halved, or chopped", "1 cup halved or quartered cherry tomatoes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the oil: In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil and lemon zest until you see the first tiny bubble appear on the side of the pan.
