{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Linguine and Clams With Fresh Red Sauce", "description": "This weeknight clam pasta comes together easily under 30 minutes without compromising flavor. Canned whole clams, packed in valuable clam juices, are the pantry hero. Opt for whole canned clams, since they\u2019re more tender and delicate than the chopped or minced varieties. The key to achieving the most seafood flavor is finishing the pasta right in the clam sauce, so that the pasta absorbs all of the briny flavors as it cooks. The sauce gets a nice fresh boost from the addition of sweet cherry tomatoes, while Parmesan and butter stirred in at the end create a rich, silky sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/06/dining/kc-linguine-and-clams/merlin_189026370_c54217fd-7cf3-4ccf-9b8d-3d7a691ffcaa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "pastas, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, clams, linguine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 785}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound linguine", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound cherry tomatoes", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 (6-ounce) cans whole clams, juices reserved", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for garnish", "1/2 cup chopped fresh curly or flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish", "Red-pepper flakes, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.
