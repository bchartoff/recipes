{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Barley Risotto With Greens and Seared Scallops", "description": "A great vegetarian entree for fall, this creamy risotto can be served with scallops or seared halibut fillets; you could also add more leafy greens and top it with with slivers of aged cheese. Using barley instead of rice produces a nutty chew that works with the sweetness of root vegetables. You can use less butter and cream than the recipe calls for, but the end result won\u2019t be quite as deliciously runny and rich. The Saltry restaurant, in Halibut Cove in southern Alaska, is reachable only by boat or seaplane. Like a culinary Brigadoon, it appears every summer and evaporates each fall \u2014 and has done so since 1984, when Marian Beck, a native of the area, decided it was time for the food of Alaska\u2019s wilderness to move beyond canned corned beef hash and smoked fish. Modern dishes like this risotto, beet salad with savory sesame brittle, and black cod with dashi and paprika oil now sit comfortably on the menu with classics like house-pickled salmon, smoked cod chowder, and oysters and mussels raised just yards offshore.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/10/dining/20140910-HALIBUT-slide-X9AU/20140910-HALIBUT-slide-X9AU-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "barley, halibut, risotto, rutabaga, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 52}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large sweet potato or baking potato, peeled and roughly diced", "1 medium rutabaga, peeled and roughly diced", "1 medium yellow onion, peeled and roughly diced", "1 large carrot, peeled and roughly diced", "2 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed", "1 shallot, peeled and roughly sliced", "2 teaspoons salt, more to taste", "2 cups heavy cream", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "2 bay leaves", "Freshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon, more to taste", "8 ounces (2 sticks) butter", "2 medium yellow onions, peeled and minced", "1 tablespoon salt, more to taste", "1 pound pearled barley, picked over and rinsed", "2 cups vegetable stock", "3 bay leaves", "1 (12-ounce) bunch Swiss chard", "Vegetable oil, like grapeseed or canola", "6 7-ounce skinless halibut fillets or 30 plump dry sea scallops", "1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley, basil or cilantro, plus extra for garnish", "Sliced pickled hot peppers, like jalape\u00f1o, cherry or banana (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium-size heavy pot, heat oil over medium-low heat just until shimmering.
