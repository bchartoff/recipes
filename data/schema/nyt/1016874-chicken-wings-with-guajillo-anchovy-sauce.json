{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Wings With Guajillo Anchovy Sauce", "description": "At Ducks Eatery in the East Village, the chef, Will Horowitz, believes in the bar snack as a maximum-detonation flavor bomb. And he\u2019ll go to great lengths to achieve that: Many of the dishes at Ducks, including the restaurant's wings, shown here, depend on labor-intensive rounds of fermenting and smoking. For our version of the recipe, though, we asked him to reel in the effort without cutting back on the flavor. Think of the result (which involves anchovy fillets, Thai fish sauce, guajillo chiles, ancho chiles and ground chamomile) as a stealth way to sneak ambitious gastronomy into your next Super Bowl party.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/15/dining/20141015-WINGS-slide-TLPE/20141015-WINGS-slide-TLPE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15H25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, finger foods", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, chicken wings, guajillo chiles, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 50}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup brown sugar", "1/4 cup kosher salt", "1/4 cup lemon juice", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons Thai fish sauce", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon smoked paprika", "3 garlic cloves, peeled", "Stems from 1 bunch fresh cilantro", "16 large whole chicken wings", "3 dried guajillo chiles", "1 dried ancho chile", "5 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 small shallot, roughly chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons Thai fish sauce", "1 1/2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper", "Rinds and pulp of 2 juiced lemons, coarsely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika", "6 white anchovy fillets", "1 tablespoon finely ground chamomile flowers (finely ground pure chamomile \u201ctea\u201d may be used)", "1/2 cup fresh lemon juice", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste", "1/4 cup melted clarified butter or ghee", "Zest of 1 whole fresh lemon, or finely diced rind of 1 brined lemon", "Coarsely chopped leaves from 1 bunch cilantro, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Brine the wings:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the brown sugar, kosher salt, lemon juice, granulated sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce and smoked paprika.
