{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Enchiladas", "description": "This Mexican recipe came to The Times in 2002 by way of Amanda Hesser. It is a simply prepared casserole of shredded chicken rolled in corn tortillas underneath a mild, seed-speckled tomatillo sauce. Crumbled queso a\u00f1ejo, a sharp white cheese, is sprinkled over the top before it is baked until the cheese melts and the entire dish is heated through. You could serve it with rice and a medley of steamed beets, cauliflower and carrots, as a cook in Mexico might, but a crisp green salad would be welcome, too. (After reading several comments from readers who felt the sauce needed to be doubled, we retested the recipe and agreed. We've updated the amounts accordingly.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/06/dining/06COOKING-ENCHILADAS1/06COOKING-ENCHILADAS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "chicken breast, corn tortillas, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1035}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 861, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "81 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1662 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Sea salt", "4 skinless, boneless chicken-breast halves", "2 pounds tomatillos, papery skin removed", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 large white onions, peeled, 1 chopped, the other sliced into rings", "2 tablespoons minced jalape\u00f1o", "3 tablespoons chopped cilantro", "12 corn tortillas", "8 ounces queso a\u00f1ejo or cotija, crumbled", "Mexican crema or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a pan of salted water to a simmer and poach the chicken over low heat until just cooked through, about 9 minutes.
