It starts with ginger-scented chicken-cilantro meatballs that are browned, then simmered in a fragrant coconut milk broth that\u2019s inspired by tom kha gai, a Thai chicken-coconut soup seasoned with lemongrass, galangal, makrut lime leaves and chile. A heap of spinach is added for color and flavor, and a squeeze of lime adds brightness and punch. The soup is brothy, so serve it over rice or another grain to make it a full meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/13/dining/as-thai-chicken-meatball-soup/merlin_164331288_f7304b37-3bd7-4a8d-9d3f-d75abdf4df29-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry, soups and stews", "keywords": "cilantro, coconut milk, fish sauce, garlic, ginger, ground chicken, jalape\u00f1o, lime, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2644}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (4-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled", "6 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 jalape\u00f1o", "2 pounds ground chicken", "1 large bunch cilantro, leaves and stems finely chopped, a few whole leaves reserved for serving", "3 tablespoons fish sauce", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons vegetable or coconut oil, plus more as needed", "2 cups chicken broth", "1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "5 ounces baby spinach", "1 tablespoon lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving", "Steamed white or brown rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using the small holes of a box grater, or a Microplane, grate the ginger, garlic and jalape\u00f1o (or finely chop them by hand).
