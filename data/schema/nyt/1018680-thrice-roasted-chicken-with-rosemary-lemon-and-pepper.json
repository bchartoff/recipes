{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thrice-Roasted Chicken With Rosemary, Lemon and Pepper", "description": "This recipe from Justin Smillie, the chef at Upland in New York, is all about layering extra flavors, textures and fragrances onto a basic herb-roasted chicken. It\u2019s perfect for a dinner party: crowd-pleasing, but not at all boring. First you brine the chicken for juicy flesh; then air it out to get crispy skin; then rub it with an herb paste to give it flavor. This takes time \u2014 you'll need two days for the brining and drying \u2014 but the actual cooking is minimal. Don\u2019t be alarmed by the idea of \u201cthrice\u201d roasting \u2014 it\u2019s a basic restaurant technique of searing a protein on top of the stove, cooking it through in the oven, then bringing it back onto the stove for a final basting (with butter, of course). A large, heavy skillet is all you need to pull this off.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/29/dining/29SENSES7/29SENSES7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P2DT40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "chicken, rosemary, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 120}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bay leaf, preferably fresh", "4 fresh thyme or small rosemary sprigs", "1 cup kosher salt", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "1 lemon, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup black peppercorns, toasted and roughly crushed", "3 1/2 to 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (use whole breasts or legs, or a combination)", "1/2 teaspoon toasted black peppercorns", "1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 1/2 tablespoons apple cider or white wine vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 garlic clove, finely grated", "2 tablespoons anchovy paste", "Olive oil and kosher salt", "3 tablespoons butter", "1 bay leaf", "3 fresh thyme or rosemary sprigs", "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar (optional)", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, more to taste\u00a0(optional)", "Salt and ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brine the chicken: Using your fingers, rub bay leaf and thyme sprigs until fragrant.
