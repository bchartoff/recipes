{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Honey Ham", "description": "A little honey soaks into the slices and crackles on the brown sugar crust of this celebration ham, which ends up with a just-right salty-sweetness. Gently simmering presliced ham on the stovetop before blasting it quickly in a hot oven to caramelize its honey-mustard coating keeps the meat moist and makes it intensely flavorful all the way through. Warming a sliced ham with only an oven bake invariably dries it out and takes a long time. This faster method will give you a juicy ham with the surprising piney perfume of juniper berries and the warmth of cloves. You can double the ingredients below for a spiral-sliced half-ham and use a bigger pot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/13/dining/08korex-ham/08korex-ham-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "dijon mustard, ham, white wine, easter, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 354}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups Riesling or other semi-dry white wine", "1 tablespoon juniper berries", "1 teaspoon whole black or green peppercorns", "5 whole cloves", "3 tablespoons honey", "1 large onion, thickly sliced", "1 presliced quarter-ham (4 to 6 pounds), drained if needed", "1/2 packed cup brown sugar", "3 tablespoons whole-grain Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Choose a pot that fits the ham with enough space on top to close its lid and with space between the ham and the sides.
