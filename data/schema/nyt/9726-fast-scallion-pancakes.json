{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fast Scallion Pancakes", "description": "This isn\u2019t the dense scallion pancake you see served in Chinese restaurants, which is made with what amounts to bread dough. But this recipe is inspired by that pancake. Made with a simplified, scallion-laden batter, it is a fork-tender pancake reminiscent of a vegetable fritter. The flavor is great, and the preparation time is about 20 minutes, an improvement on the hours you\u2019d need to let typical scallion pancake dough rise. They are good not only as a side dish, but also as a platform for stews and juicy roasts \u2014 place a couple on a plate and spoon the stew on top. And although I still associate them with Asian-flavor dishes, omitting the optional soy sauce makes them a perfect accompaniment to braised foods that use European seasonings. (If you omit the soy sauce, also feel free to use any vegetable oil, or even good olive oil.) The same formula can be used to make pancakes with other members of the onion family, especially shallots and spring onions.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/17/dining/17COOKING-SCALLION-PANCAKES2/17COOKING-SCALLION-PANCAKES2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "eggs, flour, scallion, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 459}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 bunches scallions or spring onions, about 1 pound", "1 egg", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1/2 cup flour", "Peanut, canola or olive oil as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil while you trim the scallions.
