This version, made with ingredients from an American supermarket, follows the tradition of sandwiching two rounds of rolled-out dough with jam. In the Pays Basque, where the filling is sometimes pastry cream, the jam is usually local black cherry. Once baked, the texture of the \u201ccake\u201d \u2014 never mind that it\u2019s about as much cake as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018668-boston-cream-pie\">Boston cream pie</a> is pie \u2014 is a mix of crumbly, tender and chewy.
