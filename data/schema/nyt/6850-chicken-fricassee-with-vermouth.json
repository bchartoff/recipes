{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Fricassee With Vermouth", "description": "This is an elegant, velvety take on a traditional skillet-supper, perfect with a mound of fluffy white rice. Cooking this fricassee with the aperitif known as dry vermouth instead of the more traditional white wine results in a slightly sweeter and more aromatic sauce than you would ordinarily get. (White vermouth is composed of, among other things, white wine plus a bit of sugar, herbs and plants and, at times, the bark of trees.) But white wine will work as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Craig Claiborne And Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/07/dining/recipes-chickenfricassee/recipes-chickenfricassee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, times classics", "keywords": "carrot, chicken, dry vermouth, heavy cream, leek, poultry, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 538}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 501, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "647 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 three-and-one-half-pound, ready-to-cook chicken, cut into serving pieces", "Salt, if desired", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons butter", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped onion", "1 clove garlic, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons flour", "3/4 cup dry white vermouth", "1/4 cups chicken broth", "1 bay leaf", "2 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried", "1 cup carrots cut into fine, julienne strips, about two inches long", "1 1/2 cups loosely packed leeks cut into fine, julienne strips, about three inches long", "1/2 cup heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper to taste."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the butter in a skillet and add the chicken pieces skin side down.
