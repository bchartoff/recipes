{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoked Almond Pesto Spaghetti", "description": "Smoked almonds lend their signature salty, smoky flavor to this unique weeknight pesto pasta. The sauce is reinforced with smoked paprika for extra depth and brightened with a generous amount of fresh, herbaceous parsley. Peas are added to the pasta during the last couple minutes of cooking; broccoli florets would also work nicely. The versatile sauce can be doubled and stored in the fridge for about 5 days. It\u2019s great on roasted chicken, fried eggs or even potato salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/16/dining/kc-smoked-almond-pesto-spaghetti/merlin_210911790_ae5a80bb-2376-496c-a357-23fe551125a9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "almonds, basil, spaghetti, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 447}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 pound spaghetti", "1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen peas", "3/4 cup/4 ounces smoked almonds", "2 garlic cloves", "1 1/2 packed cups/1\u00bd ounces fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish", "1 packed cup/1 ounce flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for garnish", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "3/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "2 tablespoons lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
