{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tea-Soaked Drunken Chicken With Cilantro-Scallion Oil", "description": "Made from fermented glutinous brown rice, Shaoxing wine is what gives this dish its slightly sweet flavor and nutty fragrance. The dish relies heavily on the wine's aroma and flavor, so if you can\u2019t find it, substitute with a good quality dry sherry (a Manzanilla variety will work well). Here, the chicken is poached instead of simmered, guaranteeing a moist bird that soaks in the flavor of its cooking liquid. But if it's a more intense flavor you're looking for, allow the chicken to chill in the poaching liquid overnight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/dining/drunken-chicken/drunken-chicken-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "black tea, chicken breast, ginger, rice wine, dairy-free, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 273}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 932, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "73 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "57 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1147 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups short-grain brown rice", "2 cups Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)", "5 unflavored black tea bags (such as English breakfast)", "3 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "3 tablespoons turbinado sugar", "1 (5-inch) piece ginger, scrubbed and thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns", "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1/2 pound each)", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped scallions", "1/2 cup safflower or other neutral oil", "1 tablespoon lime juice", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, combine rice and 2 1/4 cups water and bring to a boil.
