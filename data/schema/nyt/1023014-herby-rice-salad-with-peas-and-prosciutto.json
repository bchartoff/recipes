{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herby Rice Salad With Peas and Prosciutto", "description": "This bright, lemony salad laced with fresh herbs is a passport to spring. Simmering the rice in plenty of salted water just until it\u2019s al dente and then cooling it well is key. Blanched fresh peas are terrific if you can find them, but frozen work just fine. The trick is marinating them in lemony olive oil, a technique borrowed from the Michigan chef Abra Berens, who uses it in her comprehensive book \u201cRuffage: A Practical Guide to Vegetables\u201d (Chronicle Books, 2019). The prosciutto adds a nice salty hit, but you could sub in a dollop of creamy ricotta or leave both out for your vegan friends. Either way, the recipe delivers a bright salad that can stand in for a light meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/23Nunn-Herby-Rice-Salad-a/merlin_203820966_b740bcc5-6d55-474f-b34d-71074c7622bf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, grains and rice, salads and dressings, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "peas, prosciutto, rice, ricotta, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 190}, "recipeIngredient": ["Flaky sea salt", "2 cups long-grain white rice", "3 cups shelled peas, briefly blanched (if fresh) or raw (if frozen)", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "A few thick slices of red onion (these will be removed, so you want them big enough to locate for removal; they are like the booster rockets you leave behind on your way into rice-salad outer space)", "2 lemons, zested and juiced, plus additional lemon wedges", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 cup slivered basil, plus more to taste", "1/2 cup slivered mint, plus more to taste", "1/4 cup chopped parsley, plus more to taste", "2 or 3 tablespoons sliced chives (or 1 to 2 tablespoons of finely chopped red onion), plus more to taste", "12 to 16 slices of prosciutto (optional)", "Fresh ricotta (preferably a local or all-natural brand), for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the rice: Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and salt it.
