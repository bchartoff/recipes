{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Tofu With Balsamic Tomatoes", "description": "You don\u2019t need to fry tofu to get it crisp-edged and golden brown. Drizzling it with a mix of cornstarch and oil, then roasting it will deliver a closely crunchy approximation that won\u2019t splatter oil across your countertop. Here, the tofu is roasted alongside balsamic-glazed cherry tomatoes, sliced garlic and red onions, all of which caramelize as they cook. Top everything with a handful of fresh herbs, then serve it over rice, quinoa or another grain for an easy, plant-based meal. Note that the recipe serves only two to three. To double it, use two sheet pans and add a few extra minutes to the cook time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/30/dining/30appetite-3/merlin_199407099_b0479456-485d-4818-86ac-8c80cf6c3af7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, weekday, weeknight, beans, main course", "keywords": "balsamic vinegar, cherry tomatoes, extra-firm tofu, firm tofu, red onion, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2370}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14- to 16-ounce) package extra-firm or firm tofu, cut crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved if large, kept whole if small", "1 large red onion, cut into 1/4-inch wedges (about 2 cups)", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 1/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, plus more for finishing", "1/2 cup fresh cilantro or parsley leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange tofu slices on a clean kitchen towel or on paper towels.
