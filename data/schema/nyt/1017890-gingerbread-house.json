The recipe came to us from Genevieve Meli, the pastry chef at Il Buco Alimentari in Manhattan, and it works just as well for cookies as it does for a gingerbread house. This recipe makes one small house, so you may consider doubling the recipe for a larger structure, but note: only one recipe at a time will fit in the bowl of a standard stand mixer, so plan ahead. (Ms. Cooke John and Ms. Meli also built a gingerbread structure for us, and you can watch that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/dining/100000004089384/gingerbread-dream-team.html\">here.</a>)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/10/dining/10COOKING-GINGERBREADHOUSE/10COOKING-GINGERBREADHOUSE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H20M", "recipeYield": "1 small gingerbread house", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 100}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/120 milliliters dark corn syrup", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters molasses", "3/4 cup/160 grams dark brown sugar", "10 tablespoons/142 grams margarine or shortening", "4 1/2 cups/540 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out the dough", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "4 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "2 1/4 teaspoons ground cloves", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground star anise, from 2 to 3 stars (optional)", "Royal icing, <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017887-royal-icing\">see recipe</a>", "Candy, such as gumdrops, licorice and candy canes, for decorating"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the gingerbread: Combine the syrup, molasses, brown sugar and margarine in a saucepan over medium heat.
