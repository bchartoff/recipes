Feel free to reach for whatever frozen berries you might have on hand, and cinnamon, cardamom or any other sweet spice in place of the star anise. You could serve this with Greek yogurt instead of the cream or, if you\u2019d like, some homemade or store-bought custard. Serve this as a brunch dish or as a late afternoon treat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/dining/27Ottorex/merlin_174750138_c0382319-1a33-41a6-ad1e-246b5accbf72-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, weeknight, pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "apple, berries, brown butter, butter, rolled oats, sourdough, star anise, vanilla", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 473}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds/680 grams Braeburn or Gala apples (3 or 4), each peeled, cored and cut into 6 wedges", "1 cup/100 grams superfine/caster sugar", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/130 grams unsalted butter", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground star anise or cinnamon", "4 ounces/115 grams stale, crustless sourdough, roughly torn into 1/2-inch/1-centimeter pieces (about 2 cups)", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/100 grams rolled oats", "1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt", "1 pound/450 grams frozen mixed berries", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters heavy cream (double cream), chilled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit/200 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the apples, half the sugar, 2 tablespoons/30 grams butter, 3/4 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon star anise to a large, ovenproof skillet, and stir to combine.
