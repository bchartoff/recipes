{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Aligot (Mashed Potatoes With Cheese)", "description": "Somewhere between buttery mashed potatoes and pure melted cheese lies aligot, the comforting, cheese-enhanced mashed-potato dish from central France. The key to getting a smooth, airy texture is to rice the potatoes while they're still hot, then incorporate cold butter, hot milk and grated cheese over low heat. To build up the stringiness of that melting cheese, Ham el-Waylly, a chef at the Brooklyn restaurant Hail Mary, suggests whipping it with confidence, speed and vigor. This is what will create aligot's characteristic cheese strings: long and sheer, with some elasticity. \"They should fight with you,\" Waylly says. While fresh tomme or Cantal is traditional, Gruy\u00e8re or Comt\u00e9 work well, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/20/magazine/20eat-copy/20eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butter, cheese, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 283}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 630, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "sodiumContent": "531 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound russet potatoes, peeled and quartered", "1/4 pound cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1/2 cup cream, heated", "1/2 pound Comt\u00e9 or Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Simmer the potatoes in water until very tender to the point of a knife, about 15 to 20 minutes.
