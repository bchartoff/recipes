It is during this month that bakeries start making the pastry for these stuffed pancakes, and the lines spill into the street as people wait their turn to buy them. Golden underneath and speckled with bubbles on top, qatayef are cooked only on one side. They can be large or small. The large ones are normally stuffed with nuts or cheese and folded over, then fried or baked, and drenched in sugar syrup. The small ones, called qatayef asafiri (or little bird qatayef), are stuffed with a creamy filling, only half closed, then dipped in pistachio and drizzled with thick, faintly floral sugar syrup. The batter is very simple; the key is to make sure it is the right consistency, like that of heavy cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Reem Kassis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/30/dining/29qatayefrex/28qatayefrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 30 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "pancakes, pastries, dessert", "keywords": "mascarpone, orange blossom water, pistachio, rose water, semolina flour, ramadan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 252}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "A squeeze of fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon orange blossom water or rose water, or a combination", "1 cup/125 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/40 grams fine semolina flour", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon instant or quick-rise yeast", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon ground mahlab (optional, see Tip)", "1/4 teaspoon orange blossom water or rose water (optional)", "1 cup/8 ounces mascarpone", "1/2 cup/120 grams heavy cream", "3 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 teaspoon orange blossom water or rose water, or a combination", "1/4 cup/about 1 ounce finely ground unroasted, unsalted pistachios, preferably Turkish, for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, lemon juice and 1/4 cup water.
