You can play around with the mix of greens; switch out beet greens for spinach, or some of the chard for kale (kale will require a minute or two more of blanching). I have kept the seasonings to a minimum as you have plenty to prep, but a Proven\u00e7al cook would probably add chopped parsley and perhaps savory or rosemary.
