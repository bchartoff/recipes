Halloumi is a springy Cypriot cheese that bronzes when hit with intense heat, but you must pat it dry before grilling. Pile the singed cheese atop sliced tomatoes, which are seasoned here with salt and olive oil to concentrate their flavor. The salt will also extract water from the tomatoes, creating a light dressing. Finally, for texture, everything is sprinkled with a combination of crushed coriander and cumin seeds, red-pepper flakes and a touch of sugar. (You could also use a store-bought or homemade <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014696-peanut-dukkah\">dukkah</a> if you have it on hand.)
