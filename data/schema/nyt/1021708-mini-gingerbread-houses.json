{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mini Gingerbread Houses", "description": "If you\u2019re looking for the sturdiest of gingerbread houses, this recipe will get you there. (Here's a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/mini-gingerbread-houses/0212db588eb57244/full.pdf\">printable cut-out template</a>.) A high quantity of shortening is the secret to a strong house that will last for weeks (or more). If you like to nibble on your gingerbread house, use unsalted butter in place of shortening for a tastier and more cookie-like flavor. Whichever you choose, be sure to bake the cookies until they\u2019re very crisp; doing so will reduce the moisture in the dough, which is important for the house\u2019s stability. This recipe will produce more dough than you need for one large house or three small houses. Re-roll the scraps and make an extra small house, or create decorative elements like a door, window ledges, shutters, a chimney, or gingerbread people to snack on while you decorate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/07/dining/ejm-gingerbread-village/merlin_180930123_4a3f05c0-f63a-4567-8626-0cef3090a636-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 3 1/4 pounds/1475 grams dough (3 small houses or 1 large house)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "allspice, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, molasses, nutmeg, shortening, christmas, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 167}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 1/2 cups/700 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "6 ounces/170 grams shortening, at room temperature", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters molasses", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 large egg yolk, at room temperature", "Royal icing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, baking soda and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed, cream the shortening, butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes.
