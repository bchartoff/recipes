The brightness of this pickle has lately elbowed its way out of Morocco\u2019s tagines. New York chefs add the minced peel to salads and garnish fried seafood with it; the cured-lemon flavor is particularly friendly to salmon, carrots, olives, parsley and potatoes. The lemony brine is great in a bloody mary.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/lemonspreserved/lemonspreserved-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 413}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 81, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "612 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["9 organic lemons ", "Kosher salt", "1 heaping teaspoon black peppercorns", "2 bay leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Scrub 3 to 5 organic lemons, enough to fit snugly in a medium jar with a tight-fitting lid (have 2 to 4 more ready on the side).
