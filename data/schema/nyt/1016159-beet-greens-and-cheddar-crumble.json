{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beet, Greens and Cheddar Crumble", "description": "This unusual, savory crumble is reminiscent of macaroni and cheese, but vegetable matter (beets and beet greens) standing in for the pasta. The vegetables are bound with a rich b\u00e9chamel laced with grated clothbound cheddar, and the whole thing is topped with peppery oatmeal crumbs. As written, the recipe is at once comforting and sophisticated. If you like things on the fiery side, a squirt of sriracha does the trick. And if you or your family feel the need for meat to complete the meal, a side of grilled sausages would fill the bill beautifully.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/26/dining/26CASSEROLE4/26JPCASSEROLE4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beets, cheese, greens, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 678}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 368, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "578 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound medium beets", "3 sprigs fresh thyme branches plus 3/4 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/4 pounds beet greens, Swiss chard or a mix of both", "11 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, more for greasing pan", "150 grams all-purpose flour (1 1/3 cups)", "2 cups milk", "9 ounces sharp Cheddar, grated (2 1/4 cups)", "2 to 3 tablespoons English mustard powder, to taste", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce", "1/2 teaspoon Tabasco sauce, more as needed", "25 grams rolled oats (1/4 cup)", "20 grams toasted hazelnuts, chopped (3 tablespoons)", "1 1/2 teaspoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine beets, thyme branches, garlic and peppercorns in a large pot.
