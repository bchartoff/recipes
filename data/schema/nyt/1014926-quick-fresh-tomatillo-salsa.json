{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quick Fresh Tomatillo Salsa", "description": "Tomatillos, which are closer botanically to the gooseberry than to the tomato, have a wonderful acidic tang. To get the best out of them they should be simmered or grilled for about 10 minutes, until they\u2019re soft and the color has gone from pale green to olive. You can use them for a quick, blended salsa (like the one in this recipe) and also for a cooked salsa, which has a rounder, seared flavor. Use on tacos, or as chip or vegetable dip, or alongside grilled chicken or pork.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/29/science/recipehealth29/recipehealth29-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 cups, serving 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low calorie, low-carb, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, jalape\u00f1o, tomatillo, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 114}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 21, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "170 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound tomatillos, husked and rinsed", "2 to 4 jalape\u00f1o or serrano chiles, seeded for a milder salsa, coarsely chopped", "1/4 cup chopped onion, soaked for 5 minutes in cold water, drained and rinsed", "", "1/4 to 1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro (to taste)", "Salt to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon)", "1/4 to 1/2 cup water, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the tomatillos in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil.
