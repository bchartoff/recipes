{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Scallop Pasta With Burst Tomatoes and Herbs", "description": "Although usually designated as a \u201csomething special\u201d ingredient, scallops make a perfect weeknight dinner because they cook in minutes. To get a good, crisp sear, be patient (it's hard for us, too) and let the pan get quite hot before adding the scallops. Once you do, leave them alone to ensure a deeply golden crust. Toss them with pasta and candy-colored cherry tomatoes that burst and get coaxed into a jammy sauce. Finish with a showering of fresh, tender herbs and a drizzle of olive oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/04/dining/ch-pasta-with-scallops-tomatoes-and-herbs/merlin_149536239_0aa05c95-efc8-4938-a0d4-77cea46458b6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, quick, weekday, weeknight, pastas, seafood", "keywords": "dairy-free, herbs, pasta, scallops, shallot, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1006}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 453, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "679 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound linguine fini or other long, thin pasta", "4 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "2 shallots, thinly sliced into rings", "1 1/4 pounds Sun Gold, cherry or grape tomatoes", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1 pound large sea scallops, patted dry", "1 1/2 cups roughly chopped mixed herbs, such as tarragon, mint, parsley and chives, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil.
