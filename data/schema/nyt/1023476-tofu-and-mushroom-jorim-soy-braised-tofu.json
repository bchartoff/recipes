This version highlights tofu\u2019s ability to absorb the aromatic salty-sweet sauce like a sponge; earthy shiitake mushrooms add depth and a meaty texture that contrasts the tofu\u2019s softness. The dish is as delicious cold as it is hot, so it\u2019s a great make-ahead meal; simply cool and chill overnight in an airtight container.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/11/dining/kc-tofu-and-mushroom-jorim/merlin_213609903_ae93793a-7157-471c-af6d-4aca29250898-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, beans, main course", "keywords": "firm tofu, fresh ginger, garlic, make-ahead, quick, shiitake, skillet, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 580}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced", "2 scallions, cut into 1-inch pieces, plus more thinly sliced scallions for garnish", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "2 tablespoons turbinado or light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 (14- to 16-ounce) block firm tofu, drained and cut into 1-inch cubes", "6 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced into \u00bd-inch-thick pieces", "Salt", "Steamed rice and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023416-kimchi\">kimchi</a> (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, combine soy sauce, garlic, ginger, scallions, oil, sugar, pepper and \u00bc cup water; mix well.
