{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stewed Lentils With Sausage", "description": "In Italy, lentils are traditionally eaten at midnight to bring luck in the coming year. Because lentils are round, resembling coins, they are believed to bring prosperity to those who eat them. For this one-pot preparation, sausages are fried in oil to brown and release a bit of fat. Next, the soffritto and tomatoes come together, lentils are added, then the dish simmers until the legumes are tender and the liquid is saucy and thick. Like most stews, this dish can be made a few days ahead and reheated for company.\u00a0\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Anna Francese Gass"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/12/multimedia/afg-stewed-lentils-1-ded9/afg-stewed-lentils-1-ded9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, one pot, main course", "keywords": "brown lentil, italian sausage, make-ahead, pecorino romano, tomato pur\u00e9e, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 202}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound large (sweet or hot) Italian sausages", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch dice", "2 celery stalks, cut into 1/4-inch dice", "1 small yellow onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 cups vegetable stock", "1 (15-ounce) can tomato pur\u00e9e", "2 cups dried brown lentils (about 14 ounces), rinsed and picked over (see Tip)", "2 dried bay leaves", "1/2 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium.
