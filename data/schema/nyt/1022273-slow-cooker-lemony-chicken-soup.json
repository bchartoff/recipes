{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Lemony Chicken Soup", "description": "This lemony, herbal take on chicken soup highlights produce, but the basic technique is useful any time you want chicken soup with minimum effort. Slow-cooking chicken in stock creates a richly flavored, double-concentrated stock. Homemade stock is ideal, but you can also use your favorite store-bought stock or bouillon cubes. This recipe is flexible: If peas and asparagus aren\u2019t available, substitute two cups of quick-cooking vegetables, like fresh or frozen corn, baby spinach or arugula, or thinly sliced zucchini. Instead of tortellini, you can add an equivalent amount of cooked pasta or grains.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/27/dining/sd-slow-cooker-lemony-chicken-soup/merlin_188173083_773006d8-13bc-4087-b384-4173d30d32a2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, main course", "keywords": "chicken, chicken soup, lemon, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 903}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups chicken stock or broth", "1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "2 leeks, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise then thinly sliced crosswise (about 2 cups)", "2 carrots, sliced about 1/2-inch thick", "2 celery stalks, sliced about 1/2-inch thick", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "Black pepper and kosher salt", "1 lemon, juiced (2 to 3 tablespoons)", "1 cup sliced asparagus (about 12 ounces, trimmed and sliced 1/2-inch thick)", "1 cup fresh or frozen peas", "9 ounces refrigerated spinach-cheese tortellini (optional; see Tip)", "1/2 cup chopped soft fresh herbs, such as dill, mint, tarragon, parsley, chives or a mixture"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the stock, chicken, leeks, carrots, celery, garlic, red-pepper flakes, onion powder and several generous grinds of black pepper.
