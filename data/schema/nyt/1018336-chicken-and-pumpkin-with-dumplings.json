{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Pumpkin with Dumplings", "description": "Asha Gomez moved to the American South from Kerala, a region of southern India. This recipe, from her book \"My Two Souths: Blending the Flavors of India into a Southern Kitchen,\" marries Southern-style dumplings made with rice flour and Indian flavors. The dish relies on stewing the chicken, a technique common to both cultures. Although smaller, dense pie pumpkins work here, they can be stringy and have less flavor than other forms of pumpkins and hard squash. Ms. Gomez likes calabaza squash, also known as West Indian pumpkin, which has a mottled skin that can range from dark green to light orange mottled with amber. The dusty blue-gray Jarrahdale pumpkin works well, too. In both cases, you will have a lot of pumpkin meat left over to cook, pur\u00e9e and freeze for baking or soup. The kabocha squash, or Japanese pumpkin, which has a dull, deep-green skin with some celadon or white stripes and averages about two to three pounds, is another option.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/12/dining/12PUMPKIN4-WEB/12PUMPKIN4-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, dumplings", "keywords": "chicken, coconut milk, ginger, pumpkin, rice flour, thai basil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 115}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1046, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "105 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "1106 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 small fryer chicken (2 1/2 to 3 1/2 pounds), cut into 8 pieces", "1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour", "3 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 1-inch piece peeled fresh ginger, thinly sliced", "2 cups of raw pumpkin, such as kabocha, Jarrahdale or red kuri, seeded, peeled and diced", "2 stalks celery, rough cut into large chunks", "2 fresh bay leaves", "2 sprigs fresh thyme", "1 teaspoon turmeric powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "4 cups chicken stock", "2 cups coconut milk", "15 fresh Thai basil leaves, for garnish", "2 cups rice flour", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the chicken: Put the olive oil in a large Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid and heat on medium until the oil is hot.
