Rich with chocolate, coffee and bourbon (a full half cup!), it makes for a decadent dessert that's perfect for any grown-up celebration or holiday party. (This batter is very liquid, so Ms. Heatter calls for dusting the pan with fine bread crumbs. This guards against sticking better than flour, and we promise you won't notice them in the finished cake. If you don't have bread crumbs, you can use flour; just be generous and meticulous.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Moira Hodgson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-CHOCCAKE/19COOKING-CHOCCAKE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, bourbon, unsweetened chocolate, dessert, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 171}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup (approximately) fine dry bread crumbs", "5 ounces unsweetened chocolate", "2 cups sifted all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/4 cup instant espresso powder", "Boiling water", "Cold water", "1/2 cup bourbon", "1/2 pound unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups granulated sugar", "3 large eggs", "Additional bourbon (optional)", "Confectioner's sugar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Adjust rack one-third up from bottom of the oven and preheat oven to 325 degrees.
