But bu\u00f1uelos are most popular around the Christmas season when many people make them on Nochebuena, or Christmas Eve. The ingredients in bu\u00f1uelos vary depending on the region, but this version is adapted from Mely Mart\u00ednez, a food blogger and the author of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mexican-Home-Kitchen-Traditional-Home-Style/dp/1631066935/\">The Mexican Home Kitchen: Traditional Home-Style Recipes That Capture the Flavors and Memories of Mexico</a>.\u201d The dough is rolled out flat, and though it\u2019s not called for here, can be laid on an inverted bowl covered with a pastry cloth or parchment to stretch it even thinner (similar to when women flattened the dough on their knees) to make a crispy, paper-thin bu\u00f1uelo. The finished bu\u00f1uelos are topped with granulated sugar and spiced syrup made with cinnamon, anise, orange zest and piloncillo, a raw form of cane sugar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Christina Morales"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/13/dining/13Bunuelos-Mexican-Flour-a/merlin_198717315_fe09ffb3-7e63-4fb8-9768-6ed9753a3a29-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 bu\u00f1uelos", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, pastries, project, dessert", "keywords": "anise, cinnamon, orange, piloncillo, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 106}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (12-ounce/340 gram) piloncillo cone, chopped into chunks or slivers (see Tip)", "1 cinnamon stick", "6 guavas, fresh, or frozen and thawed, cut into quarters (optional)", "1/4 teaspoon whole anise seeds", "1 (3-inch) strip orange peel\u00a0", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 tablespoon/13 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "1/2 teaspoon table salt", "1 large egg", "1 tablespoon/15 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Up to 3/4 cup/180 milliliters warm water, as needed", "2 cups/475 milliliters vegetable oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the piloncillo syrup: In a medium saucepan, heat 1 cup/240 milliliters water and the piloncillo over medium-high until the piloncillo dissolves, the liquid has thickened slightly and is caramel-colored, about 5 minutes.
