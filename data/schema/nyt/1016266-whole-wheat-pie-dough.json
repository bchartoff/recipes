With French quiches, however, I prefer  a crust that resembles classic French pastry. However, I always use at least half whole-wheat flour \u2013 which is not so French \u2013  not only for its nutritional superiority, but also because it gives the resulting shell  a nuttier, richer flavor that is particularly welcome in a savory tart. This dough, adapted from Jacquy Pfeiffer\u2019s recipe for p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e in \u201cThe Art of French Pastry,\u201d involves more butter than you\u2019re used to seeing in my recipes, but an occasional butter-based crust, especially when it\u2019s made with whole-wheat flour and contains a filling that is all about vegetables, is not going to kill us. Instead, it\u2019s   a vehicle for the foods  that we want to move toward the center of our plates.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/21/dining/Whole-Wheat-Pie-Dough/Whole-Wheat-Pie-Dough-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 9-inch pastry shells, 6 to 8 servings each", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "recipeIngredient": ["222 grams French-style butter such as Plugr\u00e1 (8 ounces, 1 cup), at room temperature", "175 grams whole-wheat flour or whole-wheat pastry flour (approximately 1 1/2 cups less 1 tablespoon)", "175 grams unbleached all-purpose flour (approximately 1 1/2 cups less 1 tablespoon)", "7 grams fine sea salt (1 teaspoon)", "92 grams water (6 tablespoons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place butter  in the bowl of a standing mixer.
