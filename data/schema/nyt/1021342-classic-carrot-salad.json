{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Carrot Salad", "description": "Maybe your family has made carrot salad forever, or maybe you\u2019ve seen it at potlucks, but if you\u2019re not familiar with this Southern classic, your inner voice might be screaming, \u201cRaisins don\u2019t belong in salad!\u201d But relax: This just might be the only time they do. The soft, sweet raisins complement the crunchy carrots, which are finished with a tangy dressing. Soak the raisins in hot water to give them a different, more plump texture. If you aren\u2019t a fan of mayonnaise or yogurt, use 2 tablespoons avocado oil or olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon lemon or lime juice, and add some chopped fresh parsley. Let the crunchy-sweet flavors roll over your tastebuds as you realize you\u2019ve made a simple, and delicious, dish in less than 15 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/04/dining/mp-southern-carrot-salad/merlin_174968760_87e57a61-8e0a-4bce-ad56-7618a916ddc7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings (about 4 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "carrot, mayonnaise, pineapple, raisins, easter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 502}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (8-ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained (about 1 cup)", "1/2 cup golden or brown raisins", "1/4 cup mayonnaise or plain yogurt", "1 tablespoon honey (optional)", "1 tablespoon fresh orange zest, (optional)", "6 medium carrots, peeled and grated (about 4 cups), or 1 (10-ounce) bag of carrot matchsticks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, add pineapple, raisins, mayonnaise, honey and orange zest (if using).
