{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tofu and Cabbage Stir-Fry With Basil", "description": "Tofu and cabbage make ideal partners in a stir-fry, bringing contrasting soft and crisp textures. For best results, the tofu is pan-fried until golden, then stirred in at the end to maintain its shape and preserve its creamy texture. Scrambled eggs add fluffy bites, while fresh basil perfumes and brightens the dish. The hot mustard sauce complements the caramelized cabbage. Green cabbage is used here, but Napa or Savoy varieties are fantastic alternatives.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/20/dining/kc-tofu-and-cabbage-stir-fry/merlin_213113004_5f78bcf8-9142-4b1f-aa24-b4179f977c41-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course, side dish", "keywords": "basil, bean, lentil, and tofu, firm tofu, green cabbage, mustard, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 675}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1 (14-ounce to 16-ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 tablespoon jarred hot mustard (such as Colman\u2019s or Ka-Me)", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons minced garlic (from 6 cloves)", "2 large eggs, beaten", "1 pound green cabbage (from 1/2 large cabbage), chopped into 1-inch pieces (6 cups)", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1/4 cup chopped or torn basil, plus more for garnish", "A few pinches red-pepper flakes (optional)", "Steamed rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium.
