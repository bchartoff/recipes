{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Korean Bulgogi Bolognese", "description": "In this recipe, Korean grilled barbecue meets Bolognese, the classic Italian meat sauce. Ground beef is simmered in a sauce that starts with a traditional base of saut\u00e9ed onion, carrots and celery, to which scallions, garlic, ginger and soy sauce are added. As the sauce cooks, the flavors of the tomato paste and soy sauce meld, creating a deeply salty-sweet mixture, while the addition of chopped mushrooms provides depth and complexity. Be sure to use egg pasta here as the richness contrasts nicely with the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/21/dining/chun-korean-bolognese-horizontal/chun-korean-bolognese-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "button mushrooms, ground beef, pappardelle, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1065}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 820, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "90 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1926 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "1 cup finely chopped onion", "1 cup finely chopped carrot", "1 cup finely chopped celery", "7 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons peeled, minced ginger", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 pound ground beef", "4 ounces white button mushrooms, finely chopped (about 2 cups)", "3/4 cup finely chopped scallions", "3/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/4 cup turbinado sugar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "12 ounces dried egg pasta (tagliatelle or pappardelle)", "Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat.
