{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carne Guisada (Stewed Beef)", "description": "Among the most recognizable dishes of my culture, carne guisada will cure what ails you. Beef is slowly braised with aromatic <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022007-sofrito\">sofrito</a> and tomatoes, producing a rich, delicious dish you\u2019re likely to eat too much of. For those who have lived in Puerto Rican enclaves such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago or Orlando, Fla., this is a daily staple at cafeteria-style lunch counters, as it is on the island.
