{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pulled Pork", "description": "This is party eating \u2014 and still easy enough to pull off for dinner whenever you want. Saucy and satisfying, it\u2019s the type of dish that feels festive. Pulled pork from the American South ranges in styles, but usually balances the natural sweetness of the meat, slowly cooked until it slouches into tenderness, with tanginess and spice. Here, ground and whole dried chiles season the meat and blend into a sauce with fruity complexity and mild heat. The preparation is as inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016087-pulled-pork\">barbecue pulled pork</a> as it is by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021732-carne-con-chile-rojo-chuck-braised-in-chile\">carne con chile rojo</a>.
