{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Skirt Steak With Garlic and Herbs", "description": "Grilling might just be the best way to cook up a skirt steak. The intense heat gives the succulent and flavorful cut a rich char that\u2019s smoky and crisp at the edges. The trick is to get the fire hot enough and dry off any marinade before placing the meat on the grill. This will give you the deepest sear.  Here, the meat is marinated in a garlicky herb paste flecked with pickled pepperoncini chiles. Other pickled peppers will work, too, so feel free to substitute pickled jalape\u00f1os if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got. Or use a fresh jalape\u00f1o and a dash of pickle juice to get a similar hot and vinegary punch. Lastly, be sure not to overcook the meat. Rare to medium rare guarantees tender beef.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/05/multimedia/clark-skirt-steak/clark-skirt-steak-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, steaks and chops", "keywords": "basil, garlic, scallions, skirt steak, thyme, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 594}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 341, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "376 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup basil leaves, more for garnish", "3 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced, more for garnish", "2 tablespoons lemon thyme leaves, more for garnish", "2 fat garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons coarsely chopped peperoncini (1 to 2 peppers), pickled jalape\u00f1o or other pickled peppers", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon", "Juice of half a lemon", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 1/2 pounds skirt steak"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a blender or food processor, combine basil, scallions, lemon thyme, garlic, peperoncini, salt and lemon zest and juice.
