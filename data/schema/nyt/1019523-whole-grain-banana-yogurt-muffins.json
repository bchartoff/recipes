{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole-Grain Banana Yogurt Muffins", "description": "Whole-wheat flour gives these muffins a rich, nutty flavor that\u2019s extra satisfying on fall days. Even though this recipe uses all whole-grain flour, the muffins stay light and tender in texture and delicate in taste. Combining the dry ingredients with a large proportion of wet \u2014 bananas, yogurt, oil and honey \u2014 keeps these from being dry and heavy. Plus, the acidity of yogurt and honey help mellow out the tannic taste of whole wheat. Because these muffins are so tender, their flat tops crack a bit instead of doming. You can adorn them and add crunch by sprinkling with oats, seeds, chopped nuts, grated coconut or cacao nibs before baking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/08/dining/ko-banana-muffins-horizontal/ko-banana-muffins-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, quick breads", "keywords": "banana, whole wheat flour, yogurt, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 463}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 170, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "157 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/150 grams whole-wheat flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup mashed ripe bananas (from about 2 large bananas)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters plain whole-milk yogurt", "1 large egg", "1/2 cup/110 grams packed light brown sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters honey", "Old-fashioned oats, seeds, chopped nuts, grated coconut or cacao nibs, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
