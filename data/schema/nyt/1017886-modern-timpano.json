{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Modern Timpano", "description": "A timpano is a highly festive, drum-shaped, baked pasta torte filled with all kinds of delectable goodies \u2014 meatballs, cheeses, sausages or rag\u00f9, hard-boiled eggs and penne, all coated in a rich Sunday-gravy-type tomato sauce. This updated version is more streamlined, nixing the eggs and meatballs in flavor of roasted squash and saut\u00e9ed garlicky broccoli rabe, and using purchased fresh pasta sheets instead of homemade. It\u2019s lighter, a little easier and a lot more colorful, without sacrificing the cheesy, meaty essence of the dish.\n\nMaking a timpano is undeniably a project, but you can do much of the work a few days ahead, including making the sauce and cooking the vegetables, which can be made up to 2 days ahead. Then set aside half an hour before baking to layer everything in the mold. Serve this at a dinner party when you\u2019re looking to impress.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/10/multimedia/clark-timpano/clark-timpano-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "pastas, project", "keywords": "broccoli rabe, butternut squash, dry red wine, Italian sausage, pasta, ricotta, salami, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 193}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 654, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "985 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "3/4 pound sweet or spicy Italian sausage (or a combination), sliced 1/2-inch thick \u00a0", "4 peeled, smashed garlic cloves, plus 2 additional cloves thinly sliced", "1 onion, peeled and diced", "Pinch red chile flakes", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1/3 cup dry red wine", "1 (28-ounce) can pur\u00e9ed tomatoes", "1/4 cup chopped basil, plus 1 large basil sprig", "1 medium butternut squash (about 1 3/4 pounds), peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "1 pound (about 1 bunch) broccoli rabe, thick stems discarded", "12 ounces fresh ricotta", "1 egg", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/8 teaspoon nutmeg", "12 ounces penne rigate pasta", "10 ounces buffalo mozzarella (drained weight; usually about 2 balls), torn into bite-size pieces", "4 ounces salami, cut into 1/2-inch dice, or 2 ounces prosciutto, sliced into 1/2-inch strips", "Unsalted butter, as needed", "1 pound fresh pasta sheets (usually sold for lasagna)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of oil.
