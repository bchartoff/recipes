When the paella is removed from the oven, the rice should be slightly underdone. A tent of foil is then placed on top, and the paella allowed to rest at least 10 minutes, so the rice can finish cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "chicken stock, monkfish, shrimp, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 77}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 693, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "57 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1514 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups stock, half chicken and half seafood or shrimp", "1/2 tablespoon saffron threads", "12 monkfish medallions, about 1 1/2 pounds total", "4 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 onion, chopped", "6 garlic cloves, chopped", "1/4 pound chorizo, skin removed, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "3 cups short-grain rice, preferably Spanish", "2 cups fresh green peas", "1 small red bell pepper, seared over flame to blacken skin, then peeled, cored and cut in strips", "1 small green bell pepper, seared over flame, peeled, cored and cut in strips", "18 large shrimp, peeled and deveined, about 1 pound", "1 pound medium-size mussels", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place stock in saucepan and bring to a simmer.
