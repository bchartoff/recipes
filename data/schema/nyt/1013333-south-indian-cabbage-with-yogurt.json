I\u2019ve seen other vegetarian recipes for cabbage cooked with dal (which I\u2019ve made optional here, so you don\u2019t have to go to a special Indian market), spices and coconut, but this one is the only one I\u2019ve seen that\u2019s enriched at the end with warmed yogurt. Make sure that you don\u2019t let the yogurt get too hot or it will curdle. For a vegan dish, omit the yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/03/science/05recipehealth/05recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "cabbage, gluten-free, healthy, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 95}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 96, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "167 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons peanut oil or canola oil", "2 teaspoons black mustard seeds", "2 teaspoons split, peeled urad dal, or 1 teaspoon each urad dal and channa dal, soaked for 1 hour and drained (optional)", "1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "2 dried red chilies, or 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne", "2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds", "1/2 teaspoon turmeric", "1 medium onion, cut in half root to stem, then thinly sliced across the grain", "1 small cabbage (or 1/2 large), cored and shredded", "Salt to taste", "3 to 4 tablespoons grated coconut (to taste)", "1 cup plain low-fat yogurt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil over medium heat in a 14-inch wok or 12-inch skillet, and add the mustard seeds and dal (if using).
