{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Caramel-Apple Crisp", "description": "The caramel sauce does double duty in this warm, comforting crisp. First, it lends sweetness to the apple filling, and second, it yields a lot of leftovers to serve alongside. Use firm, tart apples like Mutsu, Jonathan or Honeycrisp, which will hold their shape during baking. Room-temperature apples work best here: If your apples are cold from the refrigerator, the caramel sauce may seize a bit. Save any extra caramel sauce in your fridge for a rainy day \u2014 that is, of course, if you haven't eaten it all.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/07/dining/ya-apple-crisp/ya-apple-crisp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "apple, caramel, oats, pecan, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 70}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), diced", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or extract", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 pounds/1,360 grams tart, firm apples, such as Mutsu, Jonathan or Honeycrisp (about 6 medium apples)", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/90 grams old-fashioned oats", "1/3 cup/40 grams chopped pecans (optional)", "1/3 cup/75 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), softened"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the caramel sauce: Add the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water to a 3-quart saucepan and stir to combine.

Store any remaining sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about a week. It can be rewarmed for later use in a saucepan over low heat."}]}
