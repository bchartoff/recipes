{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "German Chocolate Cookies", "description": "While a big slice of German chocolate cake may appeal to many, baking one from scratch may not. That\u2019s where these cookies come in. They satisfy the craving for deep, dark pools of warm chocolate, sweet pecans and fragrant coconut with only a fraction of the work. To toast the coconut, spread it out on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 5 to 10 minutes. Take it out of the oven when the edges and some of the coconut in the center are deep golden brown. It\u2019s fine if some of the coconut is still pale.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/dining/02COOKING-CHOC-COCONUT1/02COOKING-CHOC-COCONUT1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, coconut, pecans, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 362}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 190, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "86 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/47 grams natural cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1/2 cup/101 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/110 grams packed dark brown sugar", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/128 grams lightly toasted, sweetened shredded coconut", "1 cup/170 grams chopped bittersweet chocolate", "1 cup/119 grams chopped pecans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
