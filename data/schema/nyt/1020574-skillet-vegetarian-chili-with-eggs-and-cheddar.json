Eggs are nestled right into the chili, so the whites cook and the yolks stay molten, in a preparation similar to a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014721-shakshuka-with-feta\"><span>shakshuka</span></a>, another popular eggs-for-dinner dish. Shower the chili with Cheddar, simmer for a few minutes and there you have it: a hearty vegetarian meal.

If your chili is thick enough, make four divots evenly spaced in the chili and crack an egg into each divot.
