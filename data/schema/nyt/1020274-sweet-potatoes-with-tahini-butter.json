{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potatoes With Tahini Butter", "description": "Carla Lalli Music, a food writer and editor, is vehemently opposed to roasting sweet potatoes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people are constantly roasting them,\u201d she says. \u201cRoasting just makes them more fibrous and leathery, and they never, ever really get crispy.\u201d Instead, she posits that steaming performs a kind of alchemy on sweet potatoes that roasting never does \u2014 the moist heat fluffs them into absorbent clouds. And to make up for the inherent blandness of the cooking method, she slathers them with a rich tahini butter spiked with soy sauce, which immediately melts into a mouth-smacking sauce. Her simple recipe ends with a shower of golden sesame seeds and a torrent of lime juice. Try it \u2014 every bite will surprise you with crunch, salt, umami and acidity to counterbalance the sweetness of the pillowy potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/26/dining/nosrat-sweet-potatoes-with-tahini-butter/nosrat-sweet-potatoes-with-tahini-butter-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "butter, lime, sesame seeds, sweet potato, tahini, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1330}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes of any color (about 4 medium), washed", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 stick), at room temperature", "1/4 cup well-stirred tahini", "2 to 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice, plus lime wedges, for serving", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "1 clove garlic, finely grated or pounded smooth with a pinch of salt", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons white sesame seeds", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a medium pot fitted with a steamer basket or footed colander.
