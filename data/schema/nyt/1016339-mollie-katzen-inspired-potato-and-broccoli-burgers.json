Mollie, with her delicious Walnut-Coated Broccoli-Speckled Mashed Potato Cakes, was way ahead of me on that idea. I loved her idea of coating the burgers with ground walnuts and barely cooking the finely chopped broccoli before incorporating it into the mix. I\u2019ve made a variation on Mollie\u2019s burgers, using red potatoes and sticking with the Indian seasonings I\u2019ve been using in other burgers this week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/13/science/13recipehealth/13recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "9 patties", "recipeCuisine": "american, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers", "keywords": "fall, spring, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 59}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 263, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "417 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups finely minced broccoli florets (about 6 1/2 ounces, or 2 good-size crowns; see note)", "Salt to taste", "1 1/2 pounds red potatoes, scrubbed and quartered", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "2 teaspoons toasted cumin seeds, lightly crushed in a mortar and pestle", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon nigella seeds", "1 teaspoon garam masala", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/4 cup ricotta", "1 cup ground walnuts (about 3 ounces; pulse in a food processor until they resemble coarse bread crumbs, being careful not to grind to a paste; you will probably have some left over)", "1/4 cup grape seed oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and salt generously.
