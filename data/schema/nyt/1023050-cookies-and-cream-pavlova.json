{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cookies-and-Cream Pavlova", "description": "The story goes that Pavlova, a dessert which both Australia and New Zealand lay claim to, is named after the prima ballerina Anna Pavlova, who performed in both countries in the 1920s. Ms. Pavlova\u2019s tutu, billowing round with layers of lace, is the inspiration for the creamy meringue dessert. This simple version combines a crackled, speckled meringue disk \u2014 crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside \u2014 and a swoopy crown of salted whipped cream. Fans of the marshmallows in Lucky Charms cereal will delight in this four-ingredient Pavlova, whose flavor is reminiscent of those hearts, stars and horseshoes. Here, the \u201ccookies\u201d in cookies-and-cream are, as ever, Oreos, which lend that dreamy teeter-totter of milky white and bittersweet black.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/24/dining/EK-cookies-and-cream-pavlova/EK-cookies-and-cream-pavlova-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "egg whites, eggs, heavy cream, meringue, oreo cookies, oreos", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 606}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large egg whites", "Pinch of salt", "3/4 cup/151 grams granulated sugar", "10 chocolate sandwich cookies (113 grams), such as Oreos", "2 cups/480 milliliters heavy whipping cream", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Pinch of salt", "5 chocolate sandwich cookies (57 grams), such as Oreos"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 250 degrees.
