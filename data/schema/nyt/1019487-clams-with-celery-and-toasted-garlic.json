{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Clams With Celery and Toasted Garlic", "description": "One of the easiest and most satisfying ways to serve steamed clams is next to thick slices of toast that have been drizzled with olive oil and rubbed with a cut clove of garlic. Another option is to take a slotted spoon and remove all the clams, leaving all the juicy goods behind and using that liquid to heat up a drained and rinsed can of small white beans, or to finish cooking pasta like linguine or spaghetti. Once the beans or pasta are warmed through and have soaked up some of that clammy business, pour it into a large bowl and top with the clams. This recipe uses littleneck clams; look for ones somewhere between the size of a large grape and small apricot. Cockles are an excellent smaller, sweeter substitute; they are extremely similar to clams in anatomy, flavor and texture. Most clams you buy have already been scrubbed and soaked to purge any sediment, mud or sand, but it\u2019s still a good idea to give them another scrub once you\u2019re in your own kitchen. And the chorizo (or bacon, or pancetta) is optional; if you leave it out, the recipe is pescatarian.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/dining/22ROMANREX-01/22ROMANREX-01-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "chorizo, clams, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 82}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 203, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "448 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 pounds relatively small littleneck clams (about 24 to 30 clams), very well scrubbed \u00a0", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 ounces dried chorizo, bacon, pancetta or guanciale, chopped (optional)", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced, plus another clove for serving", "1/2 cup dry white wine (avoid anything overly oaky, sweet or \u201ccreamy\u201d)", "2 large stalks celery, trimmed and thinly sliced on the bias, plus leaves for serving", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper", "1/2 cup parsley, tender leaves and stems", "1/2 cup chopped chives", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon or lime zest, plus 1 tablespoon fresh lemon or lime juice", "Crusty bread or thick toast, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preferably using a natural bristle kitchen scrubber (a brand new kitchen sponge will work as well), scrub the clams well under running water.
