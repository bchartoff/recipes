{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Three Sisters Bowl With Hominy, Beans and Squash", "description": "There are quite a few legends within various Indigenous communities involving the three sisters: corn, bean and squash. The ancient and advanced farming techniques from the Cherokee and so many other tribes throughout the East Coast yielded countless strains of these ingredients, in many sizes, colors and flavors.
