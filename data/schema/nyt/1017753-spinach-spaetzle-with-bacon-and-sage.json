{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach Spaetzle With Bacon and Sage", "description": "Spaetzle, the delicious little German dumplings (sometimes called batter noodles), are easy to make, though it takes a bit of practice. I prefer to form them with a soup spoon, flicking tiny half-moons of batter one-by-one into the pot, or to put the batter on a board and cut off thin strips of batter with a wet knife. Many cooks use a special spaetzle-making tool that forces squiggles of the batter into a pot of boiling water. Others push the batter through the holes of a colander, but for this you need to make a slightly wetter batter. These are green spaetzle, made with spinach pur\u00e9e, sizzled with bacon and sage leaves. (Instead of spinach, you could add chopped herbs, but plain spaetzle are divine, too.) Spaetzle take only moments to cook and can be prepared in advance, then saut\u00e9ed in butter to serve.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/dining/21KITCHEN2/21KITCHEN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "austrian, german", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "bacon, egg, spinach, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 123}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 476, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "371 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ounces baby spinach leaves or equivalent quantity of larger leaves", "4 eggs", "4 egg yolks", "Salt", "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "4 ounces bacon or pancetta, cut crosswise into thin lardons", "4 tablespoons butter", "12 fresh sage leaves", "Grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drop spinach leaves into boiling water to blanch, then transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool.
