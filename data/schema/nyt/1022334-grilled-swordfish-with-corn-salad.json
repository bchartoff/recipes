{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Swordfish With Corn Salad", "description": "Swordfish is one of the easiest fish to grill. Because it\u2019s firm and thick, it can be cooked over hot coals for a while to pick up their smoky flavor, and it doesn\u2019t fall apart when flipped. Serve with anything you\u2019d eat with a steak or pork chop, like a bright and crunchy corn salad. Here, raw corn is mixed with long pieces of chives and cilantro in a move inspired by lao hu cai, or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013037-tiger-vegetable-salad\">tiger salad</a>, a Dongbei salad of cilantro and scallions, and buchu muchim, or Korean chive salad. When the salad is piled onto the fish, the rice vinegar and sesame oil dressing seasons the fish, and the corn and herbs soften slightly from the heat. The result is all at once fragrant, crunchy, juicy and satisfying.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/28/dining/28grillingrex1/merlin_189646131_c00b5135-6f4b-4a89-8882-de95139766ab-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, main course", "keywords": "chives, cilantro, corn, swordfish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 263}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6-ounce) swordfish steaks, 1- to 1 1/2-inches thick", "6 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar", "Neutral oil, such as grapeseed", "1 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more for serving", "2 ears of corn, kernels cut from cobs (about 2 cups kernels)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 ounce chives, cut into 1-inch lengths (about 1 slightly heaping cup)", "1 small bunch cilantro (about 2 1/2 ounces), leaves and stems cut into 1-inch lengths", "Flaky salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a charcoal grill for two-zone cooking over medium-high heat by pouring the coals onto one half of the grill.
