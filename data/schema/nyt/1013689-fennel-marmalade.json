Add the onion. Cook, stirring, until it begins to sizzle and soften, about five minutes. Add the fennel and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until it begins to soften, about five minutes. Turn the heat to low, cover and cook slowly for 45 minutes, stirring often. The mixture should melt down to a pur\u00e9e. Add the garlic, and taste and adjust salt and pepper. Stir together, cover and simmer for another 15 minutes until the mixture is lightly colored and very soft. Remove the lid, and if there is liquid in the pan, cook uncovered until the pur\u00e9e is thick and no more liquid remains in the pan. Stir in the lemon juice, adjust seasonings and serve. Alternately, allow to cool and serve at room temperature."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013689-fennel-marmalade"}
