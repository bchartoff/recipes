{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey-Zucchini Burgers", "description": "Consider this your dependable, blank-slate turkey burger that will always be juicy and well-seared no matter how you embellish it. Add ground spices, such as cumin or garlic powder; chopped herbs; or Worcestershire sauce or anchovies for umami \u2014 or leave the patty alone. With just a swipe of ketchup or mustard, it\u2019ll hold its own. Grated zucchini keeps the burgers moist, mayonnaise helps bind and brown them, and salting only on the outside ensures that the meat stays tender. (For a cheeseburger, drape sliced cheese on the patties during the last 2 minutes of cooking and cover the pan.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/01/dining/AS-Turkey-Zucchini-Burgers/AS-Turkey-Zucchini-Burgers-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, burgers, poultry, main course", "keywords": "ground turkey, zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 383}, "recipeIngredient": ["Neutral oil (such as grapeseed), for greasing", "1 pound ground turkey", "1/2 cup coarsely grated unpeeled zucchini (from 1 small zucchini)", "1 tablespoon mayonnaise", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "Hamburger buns, toasted", "Toppings and condiments, as desired\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly grease a plate with neutral oil and set aside.
