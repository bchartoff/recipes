{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon With Anchovy-Garlic Butter", "description": "Minced anchovies and garlic add a complex salinity to seared salmon, enriching and deepening its flavor. To get the most out of them, the anchovies and garlic are mashed into softened butter, which is used in two ways: as a cooking medium and as a sauce. Used to cook the salmon, the butter browns and the anchovies and garlic caramelize, turning sweet. When stirred into the pan sauce, the raw garlic and anchovies give an intense bite that\u2019s mitigated by the creaminess of the butter. It\u2019s a quickly made, weeknight-friendly dish that\u2019s far more nuanced than the usual seared salmon \u2014 but no harder to prepare.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/03/insider/clark-oven-salmon/clark-oven-salmon-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, salmon fillet, unsalted butter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3398}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 503, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "526 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "4 anchovy fillets, minced", "1 fat garlic clove, minced (or 2 small ones)", "1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "4 (6- to 8-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets", "2 tablespoons drained capers, patted dry", "1/2 lemon", "Fresh chopped parsley, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
