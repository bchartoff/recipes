Lunch can be more elaborate, with charcoal grilled meats, a whole sheep roast in an underground oven or stuffed lamb. Sajiyeh, a simple Jordanian and Palestinian dish of bite-size pieces of meat, is cooked in a saj pan \u2014 which is similar to a wok or cast-iron pan \u2014 over a wooden or charcoal grill. Cooking over fire does add a certain smoky aroma, but this version made on the stovetop in a cast-iron skillet very closely approximates the flavor with a fraction of the effort, making it more accessible to home cooks. It is best eaten with saj bread, which falls somewhere between <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017747-meera-sodhas-naan\">naan</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019621-sonoran-style-flour-tortillas\">flour tortillas</a>, so either of those would be a good substitute, as would <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016071-homemade-pita-bread\">pita</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Reem Kassis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/14/dining/14EID-Sajiyeh-a/merlin_190126701_da6dd426-1ffd-41c9-bf3b-29d4dab6789b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, one pot, main course", "keywords": "beef, bell pepper, onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 249}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 pound beef (such as sirloin, rib-eye, skirt steak or flank steak), cut into bite-size strips", "2 1/2 teaspoons Lebanese seven-spice blend (see Tip)", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1 small red bell pepper, halved, cored and thinly sliced", "2 jalape\u00f1os or 1 small green bell pepper, halved, cored and thinly sliced", "Saj bread, pita, naan or flour tortillas, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat olive oil in a cast-iron pan over medium until shimmering and hot, but not smoking.
