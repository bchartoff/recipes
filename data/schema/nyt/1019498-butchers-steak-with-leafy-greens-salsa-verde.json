{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butcher\u2019s Steak With Leafy Greens Salsa Verde", "description": "Butcher\u2019s steak is the name of a specific cut of steak, also known as hanger steak (and, occasionally, bistro steak). It\u2019s a cut that hangs off the cow\u2019s diaphragm, resulting in a steak that has the beefy flavor of a short rib, the fat marbling of a rib-eye and the tenderness of filet mignon. There is only one per animal, making it somewhat exclusive but not especially expensive. It is also a term used for the secret-ish cuts typically available only to butchers and restaurants; but a good butcher will gladly help you unlock those secrets. Other lesser-known, surprisingly affordable cuts that work well here include boneless short ribs, Denver steaks and center-cut top sirloin. These cuts are great with little more than salt and pepper, so you can truly assess their flavor. But a tangy, garlicky salsa verde made from dark leafy greens doesn\u2019t hurt. Serve with a squeeze of lemon and a bowl of salty potato chips for a truly faux-bistro experience.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/05/dining/05Romanrex2/merlin_143028852_04c4c45c-4f4f-4185-bb6c-b116f1967579-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, steaks and chops", "keywords": "kale, scallion, steak, low-carb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 301}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 471, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "579 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds hanger, thick skirt or flat-iron steak", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "6 scallions", "1/2 small bunch kale, Swiss chard, collard greens or mustard greens, leaves and stems very finely chopped (about 2 1/2 cups)", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "1/3 cup olive oil", "1 tablespoon canola or grapeseed oil", "1 lemon or lime, halved", "Flaky salt", "Potato chips (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season steak well with salt and pepper and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut 4 of the scallions into 2-inch pieces; set aside.
