{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Bebinca", "description": "Adapted from Nik Sharma\u2019s first cookbook, \u201cSeason,\u201d this lightly sweet pudding cake is an ideal fall dessert \u2014 a far less stressful alternative to a more labored pie. Here Mr. Sharma riffs on a traditional dessert from the Indian state of Goa, using a base of coconut milk, eggs and sweet potatoes that are roasted and then pur\u00e9ed, perfumed with nutmeg. Though he sweetens the bebinca with jaggery or muscovado sugar, alternatives like panela or dark brown sugar work too; the addition of maple syrup is a distinctly American touch. (Mr. Sharma likes to make this for Thanksgiving.) Be sure to leave time for the bebinca to cool and set \u2014 at least 6 hours in the refrigerator, but preferably overnight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mayukh Sen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/dining/sharma-bebinca-horizontal/sharma-bebinca-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "cakes, custards and puddings", "keywords": "coconut milk, dark brown sugar, jaggery, maple syrup, muscovado, sweet potato, turmeric, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 295}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 450, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "170 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 medium to large sweet potatoes (1 1/4 pounds total)", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan", "6 large eggs", "1 cup/200 grams grated jaggery, muscovado, panela or dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters maple syrup", "1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 (13.5-ounce/400-milliliter) can full-fat coconut milk", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
