{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso-Glazed Fish", "description": "Most recipes for miso-glazed fish are for salmon, because fatty fish are well suited for this preparation and salmon is particularly delicious. Nobu Matsuhisa is known for his miso-marinated black cod, which he marinates for two to three days. I can\u2019t imagine finding fish fresh enough to marinate for that long, so in my recipe I marinate the fish for a few hours before broiling and then finishing, if necessary, in the oven. The marinade is based on the Matsuhisa recipe, but I\u2019ve reduced the sugar considerably.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/14/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, kosher, nut-free, fish, miso, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 962}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 450, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "576 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup mirin", "1/4 cup sake", "3 tablespoons white or yellow miso paste", "1 tablespoon sugar", "2 teaspoons dark sesame oil", "4 salmon, trout, Arctic char, mahi mahi or black cod fillets, about 6 ounces each"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the mirin and sake in the smallest saucepan you have and bring to a boil over high heat.
