{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Clementine Confit", "description": "In the age-old French tradition of fruit confit, it takes many days and many pounds of sugar to make a whole clementine shimmer like a glass orb, preserving it for many and making it more of a conversation piece than anything you actually might want to eat. This is a decidedly fresher take that requires less sugar and time. Individual segments of the tart citrus take a long, warm oven bath in a light sugar syrup until chewy and translucent. They are a perfect topping for Ginger Chocolate Cake almost any dessert or even a bowl of yogurt, fruit and nuts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/09/dining/04leisurerex4-clementineconfit/merlin_180333021_225fa362-fd1d-4a98-8aa0-9cea604cd413-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "About 1/2 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "candies, project", "keywords": "christmas, new year\u2019s day, clementines, sugar, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 276}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 clementines (10 ounces), peeled and segmented", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 275 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange the clementines in a single layer in a small baking dish that fits them snugly.
