An immense amount of garlic cooks slowly alongside the chicken, reducing the pungency of the cloves and replacing it with a thrumming sweetness and intensity. Eat the chicken in its sauce, then spread the softened garlic on bread and dip it in the remaining juices.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 874, "unsaturatedFatContent": "48 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "68 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "919 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ribs of celery, cut into long strips", "2 medium-size onions, coarsely chopped", "6 sprigs parsley", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon", "2/3 cup vegetable oil", "16 chicken legs, any mix of drumsticks and thighs", "1/2 cup dry vermouth", "2 1/2 teaspoons salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "Freshly grated nutmeg", "40 cloves garlic, unpeeled", "French bread for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
