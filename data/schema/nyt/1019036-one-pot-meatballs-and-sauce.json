{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Meatballs and Sauce", "description": "Made with equal parts ground beef (for flavor) and pork (for fat), these meatballs use a time-saving technique involving softening bread crumbs in an egg-ricotta mixture. This keeps them impossibly light and fluffy while forgoing the usual step of soaking bread in milk, which many meatball recipes require. Aside from leaving you one pot fewer to clean, making your tomato sauce in the same dish you\u2019ve seared your meatballs in means you can take advantage of the flavorful bits left behind. Serve these however you see fit (this recipe makes enough sauce to dress four portions of spaghetti), but know that eating them out of the pot with a hunk of bread is also an option.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/28/dining/meatballs/meatballs-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings (about 12 meatballs)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meatballs", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 302}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 573, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "977 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large eggs", "1/3 cup finely chopped parsley", "1/3 cups whole-milk ricotta", "1/3 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino", "1/4 cup dry bread crumbs (not panko)", "4 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, plus more if desired", "1/2 pound ground beef", "1/2 pound ground pork", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes in pur\u00e9e", "1/2 cup fresh basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the eggs, parsley, ricotta, Parmesan, bread crumbs, 2 of the chopped garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes.
