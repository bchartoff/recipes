My addition is browned butter, an ingredient not so common in Southeast Asian cooking. This was one of my lola\u2019s signature dishes: She\u2019d cut the onions half-an-inch thick, sear them briefly, then add a little water to make the pan flare up, so they\u2019d get extra crisp. She would always plate it in a casserole dish, with enough pan sauce to sop up with rice. The beef fat should coat your lips, and then the citrus cuts through it. It\u2019s worth investing in good olive oil; every ingredient matters, because there are so few, and you can taste them all.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Angela Dimayuga"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipinorex1-Bistek/merlin_160617693_711de1c8-0f49-40d6-98e3-8ecc2cdffac9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, meat, steaks and chops", "keywords": "lemon juice, orange juice, rib eye steak, soy sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 181}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (1-inch-thick) rib-eye steaks (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "4 tablespoons good-quality olive oil", "10 fresh bay leaves", "8 garlic cloves, each clove smashed into 3 to 4 pieces", "1 large white onion, peeled and sliced crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick rounds", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 to 3 whole lemons)", "3 tablespoons fresh orange juice (from 1/2 orange)", "1/4 cup soy sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the steaks: Trim and discard any excess fat to your liking.
