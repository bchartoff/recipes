When a speck of flour dropped in the oil sizzles, reduce the heat to medium. Working quickly, dunk each parsley branch in the egg wash, dust completely with the seasoned flour and then fry on each side. The frying part is delicate; they can burn in the bat of an eye.

Will stay crisp for up to 3 hours."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5085-fried-parsley"}
