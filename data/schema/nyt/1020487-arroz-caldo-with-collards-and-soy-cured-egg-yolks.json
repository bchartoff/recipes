Add tripe and innards to lugaw, and it becomes goto; with chicken and saffron, it is arroz caldo. It\u2019s looser and soupier than Chinese congee, cooked until you can\u2019t see individual grains. I put in collard greens to make it a balanced meal and use wings because of the high bone-to-meat ratio and the jiggly skin. (Keeping the bones in will give the broth more flavor.) The soy sauce-cured yolks are probably best at the two-hour mark \u2014 they get firmer and saltier the longer they cure, so follow your taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Angela Dimayuga"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipinorex4-arrozcaldo/merlin_160617603_99d443d0-b625-4a6e-b439-198c745fc79d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings (makes 12 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, one pot, poultry, soups and stews", "keywords": "calamansi, chicken flats, collard greens, eggs, long-grain rice, saffron, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 79}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 eggs", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola", "1 medium yellow onion, minced", "8 garlic cloves, minced", "2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken flats and drumettes", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup jasmine or other long-grain rice", "10 cups chicken stock", "1 pound collard greens, leaves ripped off stems, stems discarded and leaves roughly chopped", "2 (2-inch) pieces skin-on ginger, each crushed into a few pieces, plus 1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and julienned, for garnish", "2 large pinches of saffron", "6 teaspoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons fish sauce", "6 fresh calamansi or lemon wedges, for serving", "1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cured egg yolks \u2014 and save your egg carton, as it is the perfect egg-curing holder. You\u2019ll want to first remove the top of the eggs: Working with one at a time, tap each egg on a sharp corner of your work surface around the top third of the egg to pop off the crown. Pour the egg into one palm and let the egg white sink through your fingertips to separate the yolk from the whites, discarding the egg whites or saving them for another use. Gently slide the egg yolk back into its shell, top it with 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and swirl the yolk in its shell so the soy sauce is fully distributed, settling under the yolk as well.
