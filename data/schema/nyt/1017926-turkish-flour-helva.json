{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkish Flour Helva\u00a0\u00a0", "description": "Flour helva, a thick, sweet pudding that tastes of warm, toasted flour and browned butter, is both a ceremonial and everyday dish in Turkey. It\u2019s essential at gatherings such as funerals and births, but is also often made as a staple family dessert. This version, from the Istanbul food writer Cemre Narin, was given to her by her mother-in-law, Ozden. It is much beloved for its deep brown butter and cinnamon flavor, as well as its comforting, smooth texture, with the contrasting crunchy almonds on top. It makes a filling warming dessert or snack that's especially lovely in winter.\n\nThe key here is patience. The dish takes a long time to come together, and while you don\u2019t have to stir it constantly, you won\u2019t be able to go far from the pot while it cooks. Make this when you're in the kitchen anyway, tending to other pans or projects. Be sure to get the flour deeply golden brown so it takes on a rich, nutty flavor, otherwise your helva may be bland. Pine nuts are often used here in place of the almonds. Feel free to use either one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/20/dining/20APPE/20APPE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 small servings", "recipeCuisine": "turkish", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "almonds, milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 16}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 498, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "28 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 stick/1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter\u00a0\u00a0", "1 cup/125 grams all-purpose flour\u00a0", "1 cup/200 grams sugar", "1 1/2 cups/350 milliliters whole milk", "Pinch of salt (optional)", "2 cups whole\u00a0blanched\u00a0almonds", "2 teaspoons cinnamon\u00a0\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a\u00a0medium\u00a0pot over medium\u00a0heat, melt the butter.
