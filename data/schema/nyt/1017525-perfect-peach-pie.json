{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Perfect Peach Pie", "description": "Eat a perfect peach under the summer sun and you'll experience the fruit at its messy, dripping, sugar-bright best. Rinse your chin and understand that no melon, apricot or blackberry can compete. But how often does this happen? For most of us, a great and truly perfect peach is a rare event. We can expect but one or two a season, for all our trying. Enter the pie. A peach pie can elevate good peaches to excellence and great ones to the sublime. Even a peach pie made with frozen fruit is a terrific thing. The addition of sugar helps; so, too, do a dash of lemon juice and a light sprinkle of nutmeg, which offers a slight bitterness to offset the sweet. Add a crown of vanilla ice cream for a perfect diner-style \u00e0 la mode effect.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/magazine/12eat1/12mag-12eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, peach, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 681}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 316, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "253 milligrams", "sugarContent": "36 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups or 300 grams all-purpose flour", "12 tablespoons or 169 grams unsalted butter, cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "Yolk of 1 egg, beaten", "1 teaspoon cider vinegar", "1/4 cup water, from 3/4 cup ice water", "White of 1 egg, beaten", "Pinch granulated sugar", "6 or 7 ripe peaches, peeled and sliced, approximately 5 cups", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1/4 cup or 30 grams all-purpose flour", "Pinch of ground nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pie dough.
