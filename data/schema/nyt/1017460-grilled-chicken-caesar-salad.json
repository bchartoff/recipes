Hitting the lettuce with a little fire is an unexpectedly brilliant trick; the green leaves char and crisp and the insides become slightly tender, but you still get the satisfying crunch everyone loves about romaine. If you're a pescatarian, try it with grilled tuna, salmon or scallops.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/17/dining/17PAIR2/17PAIR2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "anchovies, chicken breast, romaine, appetizer, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 421}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 620, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1059 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "4 salt-cured anchovies, rinsed and dried", "1/2 cup lemon juice", "3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "2 pounds skinless and boneless chicken breasts", "2 hard-cooked eggs", "1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano", "Salt and ground black pepper to taste", "2 heads romaine lettuce", "4 slices whole-grain bread, without crusts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small saucepan.
