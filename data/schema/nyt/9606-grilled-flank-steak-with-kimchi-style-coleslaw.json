{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Flank Steak With Kimchi-Style Coleslaw", "description": "It is easy enough to take the basic ingredients and flavors of kimchi and create a fast cabbage salad that puts ordinary coleslaw to shame. Use it as a bed for grilled beef \u2013 or anything else that has the flavor to stand up to it \u2013 and you have a great summer dish.  All kimchi packs a punch, thanks to plenty of garlic and chili peppers, and appropriate quantities are listed here. Increase the amounts if you like, though these should be strong enough. If you can get to a Korean market, buy some of the ground chili powder labeled <i>co chu karo</i>, which is hot but also flavorful. Otherwise substitute any good ground chiles or crushed red pepper flakes. Fish sauce is traditional, although you can use soy sauce if you prefer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/13/dining/13COOKING-GRILLED-FLANK-STEAK1/13COOKING-GRILLED-FLANK-STEAK1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops", "keywords": "fish sauce, flank steak, napa cabbage, low-carb, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 63}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 318, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1166 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small head Napa or Savoy cabbage, about 3 pounds", "Coarse salt", "3 spring onions or 6 large scallions, trimmed and chopped", "3 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste", "1 tablespoon co chu karo or crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste", "1 tablespoon peeled and minced ginger", "3 tablespoons fish sauce or soy sauce", "2 tablespoons rice wine or other vinegar", "1 flank steak, about 1 1/2 pounds", "Ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove tough exterior leaves of cabbage; core it by cutting a cone-shape wedge out of the stem end.
