I love it, but I never understood why nobody ever made it with cheese (cheese grits being one of the world's great creations), so I did. Purists will likely curse me, but I have to say that cheese spoonbread is possibly the most inspired idea I've ever had. It's great with sausage, but it would also pair well with country ham or any kind of stew or daube.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Reed"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/16/dining/16COOKING-SPOON-BREAD1/16COOKING-SPOON-BREAD1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "cornmeal, scallion, sharp cheddar cheese, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 68}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 283, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "364 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons butter, plus enough to grease the baking dish", "1/2 cup firmly packed, grated Parmesan cheese", "2 bunches scallions, white and light-green parts, thinly sliced", "2 cups whole milk", "1 cup half-and-half", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 cup white cornmeal", "1/2 cup firmly packed, grated sharp Cheddar cheese, preferably white", "4 eggs, separated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
