{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Velvet Fish With Mushrooms", "description": "Here\u2019s a recipe that takes its flavor inspiration from a dish served at Nancy Xiao\u2019s restaurant China Xiang, in the theater district of Manhattan: a sweet-salty rice wine sauce over velveted fish. Its preparation owes much to the teachings of the classic 1969 cookbook \u201cChinese Gastronomy,\u201d by Tsuifeng Lin and Hsiang Ju Lin, and the advice of the chef Jonathan Wu. It is what the Lins call \u201ctwo-passes\u201d cooking, with the fish cooked twice, first to velvet it, then to cover it with sauce. (It\u2019s important, Wu notes, not to think of it as stir-frying with high heat but as gentle, careful cooking that does not break up the fish.) It\u2019s great with flounder as at China Xiang, but also with tilapia, with halibut, with whatever firm-fleshed white fish you can find at the market. You can substitute firm tofu in place of the fish, or go half and half. It\u2019s a dish to fall in love with, to make your own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/09/magazine/09mag-eat-image1/09mag-eat-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "main course, mushroom, oyster sauce, rice wine, scallion, white fish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 375}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 212, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "742 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons egg white, lightly beaten", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon Chinese rice wine or sake", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 pound firm-fleshed, thick white fish fillets, like flounder, cod or halibut", "6 dried wood-ear mushrooms or shiitake mushrooms", "1 teaspoon plus 2 tablespoons neutral oil", "1 teaspoon oyster sauce", "1 tablespoon dark soy sauce", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1/4 teaspoon Chinese black vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon white vinegar", "3/4 teaspoon white sugar", "1 tablespoon sliced scallions, white part only", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour the egg white into a medium-size bowl, then add to it 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch, 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon rice wine and salt, and whisk until all the cornstarch has dissolved.
