{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pearl Couscous With Creamy Feta and Chickpeas", "description": "Baking pearl couscous with chickpeas, roasted tomatoes and garlic results in a one-pan vegetarian meal that\u2019s cozy and very savory, especially if you use a flavorful stock for cooking. Soft and almost porridgelike in texture, it satisfies the same urge as polenta or risotto. Lemon zest and fresh herbs make it bright, while feta, added at the end, gives the whole thing a creamy richness. Save leftovers to bring to work for lunch the next day; they pack up perfectly. If you feel like you need more vegetables here to round out the meal, serve this on a bed of baby spinach, some of which will wilt on contact with the hot couscous.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/dining/23apperex1/23apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, grains and rice", "keywords": "feta, grape tomato, parmesan, pearl couscous, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1359}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 614, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "85 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1019 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pint grape tomatoes, halved", "1/4 cup sliced scallions", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, plus more for serving", "2 fat garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for serving", "3 oregano, rosemary or sage sprigs", "2 cups vegetable stock or water", "1/3 cup chopped cilantro, dill or parsley, plus more for serving", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (from 1/2 lemon)", "3/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "8 ounces pearl couscous (1 1/2 cups)", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1 cup feta, crumbled (about 4 ounces)", "1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan (1 1/2 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
