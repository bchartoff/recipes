{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ginger Butterscotch Sauce", "description": "This recipe came to The Times from the pastry chef Pichet Ong, who developed it when he worked at Spice Market and 66 in New York. He served it over a kabocha squash pie with a lime graham cracker crust, but it would go equally well over cheesecake, key lime pie or chess pie. It takes about a half-hour of your time, and will add a buttery note to any dessert.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/27/dining/squashpie/squashpie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "3 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "dark brown sugar, ginger, heavy cream, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 636, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "sodiumContent": "297 milligrams", "sugarContent": "65 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dark brown sugar", "2 1/2 ounces (about 4 inches) fresh ginger root, peeled and sliced into coins", "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, pulp scraped", "10 tablespoons (5 ounces) unsalted butter, cubed", "2 cups heavy cream", "3/4 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place sugar, ginger and vanilla pod and pulp in a heavy pot set over medium heat.
