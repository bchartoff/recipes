{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cracked Green Olive, Walnut and Pomegranate Relish", "description": "This classic recipe from Paula Wolfert, who picked it up from her friend, the Turkish food journalist Ayfer Unsal, is a versatile relish that can be spooned alongside pork skewers, simply cooked fish or sliced steak. Each ingredient is important to the final relish. Leave one out and it will seem out of balance. A note: Rinse the olives with cool water before you use them, then taste one. If they seem too salty, soak them in lukewarm water for 30 minutes. Drain and rinse again.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/22/dining/22WOLFERT-REX/22WOLFERT-REX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings as a mezze or side dish", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, condiments", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, green onion, olives, parsley, pomegranate molasses, pomegranate seeds, walnut, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 102}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 140, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "592 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces cracked green olives, pitted, rinsed and coarsely chopped", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3/4 cup walnuts, finely chopped by hand", "2 green onions, white and light green parts, minced", "1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley", "1/8 teaspoon mild red pepper flakes, preferably Aleppo or Marash, or more to taste", "2 teaspoons pomegranate concentrate or molasses", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup fresh or thawed frozen pomegranate seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir to mix well.
