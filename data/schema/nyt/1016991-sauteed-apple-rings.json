{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saut\u00e9ed Apple Rings", "description": "I came across this utterly simple idea in Deborah Madison\u2019s \u201cVegetarian Cooking for Everyone.\u201d She serves hers as a dessert with ice cream, a lovely use for the apples (which she also embellishes with raisins and pine nuts). I think they make a great addition to the Thanksgiving buffet, to go with the turkey along with cranberry sauce. Or serve them with your latkes next month! Breakfast is another meal where these are welcome, right on top of your whole wheat buttermilk pancakes. I find that the apples will caramelize most efficiently if you don\u2019t crowd the pan, so I begin by saut\u00e9ing the apples in 2 batches, then I combine the batches for the final addition of vanilla and optional brandy or calvados. Both tender apples like McIntosh, Gala, Macoun and Cortland, as well as firmer apples like Braeburns, work well in this dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/18/science/19recipehealthrings/19recipehealthrings-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, snack", "keywords": "dessert, side dish, fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 93}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 122, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large apples", "1 lemon wedge", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon raw brown (turbinado) sugar", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 tablespoons calvados or brandy (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Core apples and rub inside with lemon wedge.

Cook, flipping apple rings often, until apples are caramelized, 10 to 12 minutes. Test, using the tip of a knife or the edge of a spoon, to see if the apples are soft all the way through.
