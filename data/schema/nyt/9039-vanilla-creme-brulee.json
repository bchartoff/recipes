One thing to note: Be sure to let the custard set for several hours in the refrigerator before br\u00fbl\u00e9eing the top, otherwise you'll end up with soupy custard.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/13/dining/15COOKING-CREME-BRULEE1/15COOKING-CREME-BRULEE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "dessert, eggs, heavy cream, vanilla bean, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1321}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 407, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "121 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups heavy or light cream, or half-and-half", "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "5 egg yolks", "1/2 cup sugar, more for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
