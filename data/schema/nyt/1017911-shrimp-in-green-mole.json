{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp in Green Mole", "description": "There are only three basic steps to making green mole: Whip up a pur\u00e9e of toasted pumpkin seeds, tomatillos and chiles in a blender; sear the pur\u00e9e in oil and cook it until it thickens slightly; then add chicken stock and simmer until the mixture is creamy. Once the sauce is done, you can poach shrimp right in it; it only takes five to eight minutes to cook them in the simmering mole. Better yet, you can make the sauce up to three days ahead and keep it refrigerated until you\u2019re ready to use it, or freeze it (whisk or blend to restore its consistency after thawing).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/06/dining/06MARTHA/06MARTHA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course, pumpkin seeds, serrano chile, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 132}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 262, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "774 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup hulled untoasted pumpkin seeds", "1/2 pound tomatillos, husked, rinsed and coarsely chopped", "1 serrano chile or 1/2 jalape\u00f1o (more to taste), stemmed and roughly chopped", "3 large romaine lettuce leaves, preferably the outer leaves, torn into pieces", "1/4 cup chopped white onion, soaked for 5 minutes in cold water, drained and rinsed", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "1/4 cup tightly packed chopped cilantro, plus cilantro leaves and sprigs for garnish", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock", "1 tablespoon canola or extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, ground", "Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste", "1 pound medium shrimp, shelled and deveined", "Rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a heavy straight-sided skillet or a saucepan over medium heat and add pumpkin seeds.
