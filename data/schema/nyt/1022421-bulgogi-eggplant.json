(A very hot skillet on the stovetop works in a pinch.) Bulgogi means \u201cfire meat,\u201d so this vegetarian adaptation is inspired by the flavors of the beloved Korean barbecue staple \u2014 soy sauce, garlic and sugar \u2014 and would taste wonderful alongside a handsome plate of char-grilled beef bulgogi.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a> newsletter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/28/dining/23bulgogi-rex-eggplant/merlin_190467426_18f6a945-8601-4492-a9a2-48dec394898d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "side dish", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 809}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound Asian eggplant, especially Korean (2 to 3 large), cut in half crosswise, then lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola, for grilling", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon maple syrup", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 scallion, thinly sliced on the bias, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the eggplant in a colander set inside the sink.
