For the home cook, little in the way of technique is required for similar results. Just add vinegar or citrus juice along with a bit of sweetener at the end of a quick saute of meat, fish, poultry or vegetables. The intensity of these flavors invariably allows salt to be omitted or used sparingly, and the sauces are low in fat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fava beans, honey, lime, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 42, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1202 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["25 to 30 fava bean pods (see note)", "3 quarts water", "Salt", "2 teaspoons honey", "3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed from stems", "Juice of 1 lime", "1 teaspoon unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Shell beans from pods.
