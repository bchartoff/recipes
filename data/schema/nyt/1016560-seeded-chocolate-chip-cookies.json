{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seeded Chocolate Chip Cookies", "description": "When I make chocolate-chip cookies, I always use a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014826/quintessential-chocolate-chip-cookies.html\">recipe from the pastry chef Sherry Yard</a>, with whom I wrote two cookbooks, as my touchstone. It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not I\u2019m adding ingredients like nuts and seeds, or using different types of flours. I always use a quality dark chocolate (70 percent or higher), and I cut it into chunks the way she does. I don\u2019t skimp on quantity when it comes to the chocolate, but in this adaptation I\u2019ve reduced the sugar by 25 percent and thrown in a good measure of rolled oats, sunflower seeds, chia seeds and pumpkin seeds. I\u2019ve made these cookies using half whole-wheat flour and using all unbleached all-purpose flour, and I prefer the whole-wheat version \u2014 and not just because it\u2019s healthier. I love the nutty flavor of the flour, which complements the nutty flavor of the seeds.\n<br/><br/>\nYou would think that adding wholesome ingredients like oats and seeds to a classic chocolate-chip cookie would result in something weighty, vintage 1970s, but on the contrary, the oats and seeds stretch the dough and make the cookies lighter than all-flour cookies. Bake them until they\u2019re nice and dark on the bottom, and when you rotate the trays halfway through, tap them on the oven racks to get the cookies to flatten a bit. The end result is a crisp cookie with no shortage of melting chocolate chunks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/03/science/05recipehealth/05recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 4 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chia seeds, chocolate, sunflower seeds, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 183}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 72, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "30 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/60 grams whole-wheat flour", "1/2 cup/65 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon/2 grams baking soda", "4 ounces (1 stick)/ 115 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/4 cup/50 grams organic granulated sugar (regular will work also)", "1/2 cup/80 grams packed light brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon/2 grams fine sea salt", "1 egg", "1 teaspoon vanilla/5 milliliters", "1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons/50 grams sunflower seeds", "2 heaped tablespoons/25 grams pumpkin seeds", "1 tablespoon/12 grams chia seeds", "1/2 cup (scant)/50 grams rolled oats", "8 ounces/225 grams bittersweet chocolate (or more if desired), cut in 1-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sift together flours and baking soda and set aside.
