{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Turkey With Garlic and Anchovies", "description": "In this flavorful recipe, a whole roasted turkey is seasoned like a Proven\u00e7al leg of lamb, with rosemary, anchovies and plenty of garlic. Cutting tiny slits into the turkey\u2019s legs helps distribute the garlic-anchovy paste, which perfumes the meat. You\u2019ll need to start marinating the turkey at least a day ahead, although, if you have the space in your refrigerator and the time, starting two or three days ahead is even better. Chilling the turkey uncovered helps dry out the skin, yielding a particularly crisp and golden bird.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/07/dining/07Turkeyrex1/merlin_144441174_a7ed06ff-a782-4a8a-bb69-c0823b605cf2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings with leftovers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, roasts", "keywords": "anchovies, capers, chicken stock, garlic, rosemary, turkey, wine, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 334}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 796, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "87 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1817 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 garlic cloves", "8 to 12 anchovy fillets, to taste", "1 tablespoon fresh rosemary", "1 tablespoon drained capers", "1 tablespoon ground black pepper", "Kosher salt, as needed", "1 (10- to 13-pound) turkey, giblets removed", "1 small onion, thinly sliced", "2 shallots, thinly sliced", "1/2 small fennel bulb, diced", "1/2 lemon, seeded and thinly sliced", "1 cup dry white wine", "1 to 2 quarts turkey or chicken stock, as needed", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 cup turkey or chicken stock, more as needed", "1 tablespoon tarragon leaves (optional)", "Kosher salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a blender, small food processor or large mortar and pestle, combine garlic, anchovies, rosemary, capers and pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt per pound of turkey (i.e. 5 teaspoons salt for a 10-pound turkey).
