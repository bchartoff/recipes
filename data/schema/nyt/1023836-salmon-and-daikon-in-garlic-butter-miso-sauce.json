{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon and Daikon in Garlic Butter Miso Sauce", "description": "A stunning one-pot meal that cooks in just 15 minutes, this salmon dish creates a silky miso sauce that tastes lavish. The recipe comes from Naoko Takei Moore, who co-authored \u201cDonabe: Classic and Modern Japanese Clay Pot Cooking\u201d with Kyle Connaughton (Ten Speed Press, 2015) and created <a href=\"https://toirokitchen.com/pages/about-toiro\">Toiro</a>, a Los Angeles shop that specializes in donabe and Japanese cookware. It\u2019s intended to be cooked in a donabe, a Japanese clay pot prized for its ability to retain heat and cook evenly, but also works well in a Dutch oven or other pot. Once you\u2019ve stirred together your miso sauce, seasoned your salmon and prepped your vegetables, the meal comes together with little effort, as you layer the vegetables, dashi, salmon and sauce in your pot then simmer until tender. Organize your prepped ingredients and the practice of cooking this dish feels as soul-soothing as the results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/18/multimedia/ntm-salmon-and-daikon-qchm/ntm-salmon-and-daikon-qchm-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, seafood, main course", "keywords": "daikon, dashi, mirin, miso, sake, salmon fillet, yuzu, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 160}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup miso\u00a0", "2 tablespoons sake\u00a0", "1 tablespoon mirin\u00a0", "1 teaspoon sea salt\u00a0", "1 pound salmon fillet, skin removed, cut into 6 to 8 pieces\u00a0", "1/2 pound daikon, halved lengthwise if thick, then cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices", "1 1/4 cups dashi, preferably <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023837\">kombu and bonito dashi</a>", "1 (7-ounce) package enoki mushrooms, trimmed then torn into small clusters (about 5 ounces)", "1 small carrot, peeled, cut into 2-inch segments then sliced into 1/8-inch-thick matchsticks", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced\u00a0", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into 6 to 8 pieces and chilled", "Fresh or bottled yuzu juice (or Meyer lemon juice), to taste (optional)", "Chopped dill, for serving (optional)", "Shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven-spice powder), for serving", "Freshly cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the miso sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the miso, sake and mirin; set aside.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the salmon: Sprinkle the salt on both sides of the salmon.
