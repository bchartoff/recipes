{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kalimotxo", "description": "Some might consider the kalimotxo (pronounced cal-ee-MO-cho) a guilty pleasure; I\u2019ve received more than a few skeptical glances when I\u2019ve ordered it at bars in New York. But I don\u2019t feel an iota of contrition when I drink this Basque-country classic. It couldn\u2019t be easier: equal parts red wine (some say the cheaper the better, but that\u2019s up to you) and cola. I like a squeeze of lemon juice for a little brightness, and maybe a slice of lemon or orange to dress it up. But purists might consider even those modest additions a little fussy. The overall effect is surprisingly sangria-esque, minus all that fruit-chopping and waiting, and wonderfully refreshing. \n<br/><br/>\nIf you can find cola made with cane sugar rather than corn syrup, all the better, but the drink is still fine with whatever you\u2019ve got on hand. The soda\u2019s caffeine actually makes the kalimotxo a fine pick-me-up: an ideal afternoon drink when you know you\u2019ve still got a long day, and night, ahead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/20/dining/summerdrinks-winecola/summerdrinks-winecola-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cola, red wine, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 29}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 122, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "8 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 or 4 ounces dry red wine (preferably Spanish)", "3 or 4 ounces cola", "1 squeeze lemon juice", "Lemon or orange slice, to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a glass filled with ice, combine 3 or 4 ounces dry red wine (preferably Spanish) with an equal amount of cola and 1 squeeze lemon juice.
