{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Hot Honey Ribs", "description": "These simple, snackable ribs are slow cooked until they are very tender. Then the ribs are brushed with spicy honey, and broiled for 2 minutes to caramelize. Don\u2019t worry that the ribs go into the slow cooker without liquid; the heat is gentle enough that the ribs do not burn, and the meat releases liquid as it cooks, so it braises in its own spiced juices. (You could also make these ribs in a pressure cooker by following <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020483-pressure-cooker-hot-honey-ribs\">this recipe</a>.) One thing to note: Red chiles taste best in this recipe because green chiles are less sweet and can taste grassy. Any spicy red chile will work beautifully, and red-pepper flakes work in a pinch. If you prefer green chiles, however, you can use them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/sd-slow-cooker-hot-honey-ribs/sd-slow-cooker-hot-honey-ribs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, finger foods, meat", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, baby back ribs, honey, lime, paprika, thai chile", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 175}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons sweet paprika", "1 tablespoon hot smoked paprika", "1 tablespoon mustard powder", "2 teaspoons garlic powder", "Black pepper", "2 racks baby back ribs (about 4 pounds total)", "2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "Vegetable oil or cooking spray, for greasing", "2/3 cup honey", "5 red Thai chiles or 2 red jalape\u00f1o or serrano chiles, stemmed and thinly sliced (or 2 tablespoons red-pepper flakes)", "3 (1-inch) strips lime peel and the juice of 1/2 lime (about 1 tablespoon juice)", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add\u00a0the sweet and hot smoked paprika, mustard and garlic powders and several generous grinds of black pepper to a small bowl; mix to combine."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the ribs from the packaging and pat them dry with paper towels.
