{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tacos With Spicy Tofu, Tomatoes and Chard", "description": "In these tacos, tofu stands in for meat in a vegan picadillo, cooked in a modified salsa ranchera. I\u2019ve never been one for meat \u201csubstitutes,\u201d and I normally don\u2019t advocate using tofu in anything other than Asian dishes. But I find this pretty irresistible, a sort of vegan picadillo. You can make it spicier by adding more chiles, milder by using less. The tofu is cooked in a modified salsa ranchera; being tofu, it absorbs the sweet and spicy flavors of the tomatoes and chiles. I used firm tofu and mashed it with the back of my spoon. Silken tofu is also a good choice, though then you will have something more akin to Mexican scrambled eggs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/19/science/22recipehealthalt/22recipehealthalt-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 tacos, 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, tacos", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 129}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 334, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "862 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound tomatoes", "1/2 pound Swiss chard, stemmed, leaves washed in 2 changes of water", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon grapeseed oil", "1 small or 1/2 medium red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon lightly toasted cumin seeds, ground", "1 teaspoon mild chili powder", "1 to 2 serrano or jalape\u00f1o chiles (to taste), seeded if desired and minced", "1 14-ounce box firm tofu, drained and cut into medium-size cubes", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro (more to taste)", "8 warm corn tortillas", "Salsa fresca (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat broiler with rack set about 4 inches from the heat.
