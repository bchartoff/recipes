{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tangy Braised Short Ribs", "description": "This bright, sweet and salty recipe for braised short ribs will work with bone-in or boneless meat, as long as the short ribs are thick (at least 1 1/2 inch), and not the thinly sliced Korean style. Seasoning your meat with salt and pepper at least 24 hours in advance will greatly improve the flavor of the finished product. And, if you can spare an extra 24, making them a day ahead of serving will make them even better, with all that braising liquid flavoring the meat as it sits. Finishing with herbs and lemon are hardly a revelation in the braised meat department, but they are especially welcome here. The fresh lemon juice at the end transforms the braising liquid into a bright, brothy, spoonable sauce good enough to drink.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/dining/30Roman8/merlin_170265405_0a959f02-2f74-41cc-aaa8-0308f3619ce9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "meat", "keywords": "chicken broth, honey, short ribs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 138}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 pounds bone-in short ribs, at least 1 1/2-inch thick, cut into single bone portions (or 3 1/2 to 4 pounds boneless, at least 1 1/2-inch thick)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoon vegetable or canola oil", "2 large yellow onions, quartered", "2 heads garlic, halved crosswise", "3 tablespoons honey", "1/2 cup apple cider vinegar", "1/2 cup soy sauce or tamari", "4 cups chicken, beef or vegetable broth", "4 thyme sprigs", "2 cups parsley, leaves and tender stems, finely chopped", "1/2 bunch chives, finely chopped", "Flaky sea salt", "3 lemons, halved, for juicing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season short ribs with salt and pepper at least 1 hour (at room temperature) and as much as 48 hours (covered and refrigerated) in advance."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees.
