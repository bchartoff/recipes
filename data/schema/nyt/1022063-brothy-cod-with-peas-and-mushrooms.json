{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brothy Cod With Peas and Mushrooms", "description": "In this recipe, tender, flaky cod is poached in a light, flavorful broth that optimizes bottled clam juice, a versatile yet underused ingredient. The juice is perfect for weeknight cooking, when shortcuts to big flavor are key, and it adds a subtle, briny backbone to any broth. This broth is also infused with rich shiitake mushrooms, aromatic garlic and a generous boost of bright ginger. Pearl couscous gets toasted before boiling, adding nutty notes to the soup. It also contributes delightful chewiness, but other small pastas like ditalini or orzo are also good substitutes, though cook time may need to be adjusted accordingly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/05/dining/kc-brothy-cod/kc-brothy-cod-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, seafood, soups and stews, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "clam juice, cod, couscous, ginger, israeli couscous, mushroom, peas, scallion, shiitake, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 629}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 small yellow onion, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "6 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced 1/4-inch thick (about 2 cups)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup pearl couscous", "1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice", "1 1/2 pounds skinless cod fillet, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "1 cup thawed frozen peas", "1/4 cup chopped scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium.
