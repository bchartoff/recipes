Parsley, obviously, works in abundance: it\u2019s clean-tasting, pleasantly grassy and almost never overwhelming. You can add literally a bunch (bunches!) of it to salad, soup, eggs, pasta, grains or beans. The same is largely true of basil, and you can use other mild herbs \u2014 chervil, chives, cilantro, dill, shiso \u2014 by at least the handful. (Mint is also useful but will easily take over a dish if you add too much of it. But all of these are great for making herb pastes, or pestos, alone or in combination. Use the same technique you use for basil pesto.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/dining/pastameatballs/pastameatballs-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, pastas", "keywords": "fresh herbs, ground sirloin, pasta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 166}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 750, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "89 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "549 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups finely chopped fresh basil", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh chives", "1 thin slice white bread", "1/4 cup milk", "1/2 pound ground sirloin, pork or lamb or a mixture", "Salt", "black pepper", "6 tablespoons olive oil", "1 pound pasta", "1 garlic clove", "Freshly grated Parmesan cheese for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix together the basil, parsley and chives.
