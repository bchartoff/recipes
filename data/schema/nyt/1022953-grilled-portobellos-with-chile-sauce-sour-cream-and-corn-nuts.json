{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Portobellos With Chile Sauce, Sour Cream and Corn Nuts", "description": "This is a wonderful vegetarian main dish to serve in the center of your table, with tortillas or rice and a zesty green salad. Be sure to ventilate your kitchen well when you\u2019re grilling the mushrooms and onions indoors, but, if weather permits, you can always grill them outdoors. If you\u2019d like to make this less spicy, then feel free to leave out the dried chiles, making a simple bell pepper sauce instead. Keep this dish vegan by swapping out the sour cream for a nondairy alternative.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/09/dining/04ottorex-portobello/merlin_201238689_7d342030-838a-416f-a986-47d7a4f7fb3e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "corn nuts, dried chiles, portobello mushrooms, red bell pepper, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 97}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large red bell pepper, quartered, stem and seeds removed", "1 large plum or vine tomato, halved", "1/2 yellow onion, peeled and cut into 4 wedges", "7 tablespoons/105 milliliters olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 (10-gram) dried guajillo chile, stem and seeds removed", "About 2 dried chipotle chiles (5 grams), stem and seeds removed", "2 cups/500 milliliters boiling water", "1/3 cup/75 grams sour cream", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "8 large portobello mushrooms (about 2 1/2 pounds/1.1 kilograms total), stems removed", "1 red onion, peeled and cut into 6 wedges, layers roughly separated", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and roughly crushed in a mortar and pestle", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 teaspoons maple syrup", "1/3 cup/30 grams salted, roasted corn nuts, roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit/240 degrees Celsius.
