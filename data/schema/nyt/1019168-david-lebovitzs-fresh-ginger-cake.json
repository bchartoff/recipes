It's also incredibly easy to make, and it doesn't require any special equipment \u2013 just a bowl, a saucepan, a whisk and a cake pan. Enjoy it with a cup of hot tea or a bit of bourbon (or both). We bet you won't leave a single crumb behind.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/06/dining/06COOKING-FRESHGINGERCAKE2/06COOKING-FRESHGINGERCAKE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 192}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 504, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "279 milligrams", "sugarContent": "45 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup mild molasses", "1 cup sugar", "1 cup neutral oil", "2 1/2 cups flour", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "4 ounces fresh ginger, peeled, sliced and finely chopped", "2 eggs, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position rack in center of oven.
