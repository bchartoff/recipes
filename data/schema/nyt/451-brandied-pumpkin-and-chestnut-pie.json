{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brandied Pumpkin and Chestnut Pie", "description": "This is quite possibly the best pumpkin pie recipe out there. Why? It's got two layers (chestnut and pumpkin), and it calls for fresh squash in lieu of the canned stuff (although canned works just fine, too). We've heard from readers that people who think they don't like pumpkin pie love this one. And don't fret: You don't make the chestnut paste, you buy it. It's available online and at most specialty markets.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/14/dining/Pumpkin-and-Chestnut-Pie/Pumpkin-and-Chestnut-Pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch single pie, 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "brandy, chestnut paste, pumpkin, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 183}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 484, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "307 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small sugar pumpkin or medium butternut squash (about 2 pounds), peeled, seeded and cut into 2-inch chunks; or 1 cup canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 1/4 cups heavy cream", "3 eggs", "1/2 cup light brown sugar", "3 tablespoons good brandy, such as Cognac", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "Pinch ground cloves", "3/4 cup sweetened chestnut paste (such as cr\u00e8me de marrons)", "1 pre-baked 9-inch pie crust <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-all-butter-pie-crust-with-variations\">(see recipe)</a>"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
