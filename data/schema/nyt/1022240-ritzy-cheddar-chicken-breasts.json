Skipping the usual flour-egg-bread crumb dredge, this recipe relies instead on a flavorful base layer of tangy sour cream, which has lactic acid that tenderizes boneless, skinless chicken breasts beautifully. When it comes to breaded white meat, thin cutlets are ideal, which you can buy from the store or achieve by slicing thick breasts in half horizontally (no pounding necessary). They cook more evenly this way, staying tender throughout as they\u2019re quickly baked in a hot oven. Serve with something fresh \u2014 <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020223-via-carotas-insalata-verde\">a big green salad</a>, perhaps \u2014 to balance the wonderful richness of this nostalgic number.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/04/dining/04chickenrex3/merlin_188172999_6f55478c-fa19-4d70-af0a-cce95923f52d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, egg whites, ritz crackers, sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2799}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for greasing wire rack", "1/4 cup sour cream", "1 large egg white", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds total)", "1 sleeve Ritz crackers (about 100 grams)", "2 ounces extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 cup)", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat oven to 450 degrees.
