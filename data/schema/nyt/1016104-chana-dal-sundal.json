{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chana Dal Sundal", "description": "Sundal is an addictive South Indian snack made with chickpeas, spiced with mustard seeds, chiles and grated coconut, and sold on the beach in paper cones by roaming vendors. A bit like popcorn in nature, though with a softer texture and a lot more zing, it is meant for casual nibbling. (It makes great party food.) It is also prepared for certain Indian religious festivals throughout the year. Here you make it with a small split chickpea called chana dal, but is often made with large chickpeas or other legumes, like peanuts. Look for chana dal and (other dals) at any Indian grocery or online if you can\u2019t find it at the market.
