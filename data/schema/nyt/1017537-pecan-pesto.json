He picked up her recipe for pesto during the reporting, and we've adapted it for home use. The pesto's roots are Italian, of course, but its flavor and texture nod first to the South, with pecans swapped in to the paste in place of more traditional pine nuts, and then to the wider world, with the inclusion of both Thai and opal basils to the mix. But use whatever basil you can find. Ms. Bailey\u2019s cooking is more about bending the rules than enforcing them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/27/dining/27PECANPESTO/27PECANPESTO-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, basil, pecan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 173, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "72 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small clove garlic", "1 cup fresh basil leaves", "1 cup fresh Thai basil leaves", "1 cup fresh opal basil leaves (or substitute more basil)", "1/2 cup pecans, toasted", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons freshly grated pecorino Romano or Parmesan", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put garlic in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to break it into smaller pieces.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add basil and pecans to the processor.
