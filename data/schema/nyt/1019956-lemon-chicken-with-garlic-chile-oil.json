{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Chicken With Garlic-Chile Oil", "description": "Jarred chile-garlic oil is available from many brands and in many incarnations, but it\u2019s also extremely easy to make at home. The trick is to cook the garlic in the oil slowly and gently so it doesn\u2019t blacken and burn, which will make the whole thing acrid and unpleasant. This pungent and nutty chile-garlic oil recipe was inspired by one published in David Tamarkin\u2019s wonderful cookbook,\u00a0\u201cCook90\u201d\u00a0(Little, Brown and Company, 2018).\u00a0Here, some of it is used as a sauce for chicken cutlets with lemon and capers. But keep leftover oil in the fridge to drizzle on hummus, steamed or roasted vegetables, or on top of avocado toast for a nutty, spicy kick.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/dining/06apperex1/merlin_149894484_8ffebc91-bfeb-4f3a-96af-b4ae0c01a807-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "capers, chicken cutlet, garlic, low-carb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 251}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 505, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "399 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3 to 4 garlic cloves, finely grated or pressed through a garlic press", "1 1/2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 lemon", "1 pound chicken cutlets, 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled", "Freshly ground black pepper, as needed", "3 tablespoons drained capers", "Whole cilantro or parsley leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small skillet or nonreactive saucepan, heat 1/2 cup oil, garlic, red-pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt over low heat.
