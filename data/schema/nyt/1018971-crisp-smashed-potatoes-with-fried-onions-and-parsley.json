{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crisp Smashed Potatoes With Fried Onions and Parsley\u00a0", "description": "Some of you may be thinking, \u201cDoes the world need another crisp smashed potato recipe?\u201d At least some of you are saying, \u201cYes, we do!\u201d So here you go. Regular olive oil works if you don't have chicken fat around, but this recipe is so good, it's worth roasting a chicken. A few tips: Don\u2019t over-steam the potatoes or they will fall apart, but don\u2019t under-steam or you\u2019ll never be able to crush them. Also, let the potatoes cool a bit before you smash them so they dry out a bit; this, too, helps them stay intact. Finally, the chicken fat (or oil) must be very hot. If it is not hot enough, it will soak into the potato rather than crisp it. These are the best. And the crispiest. Make them. You\u2019ll be so happy.
