{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Camarones Embarazados (Adobo Grilled Shrimp)", "description": "Camarones embarazados translates to pregnant shrimp, but these crustaceans aren\u2019t necessarily carrying roe. The catchy name is a play on words: \u201cen vara\u201d means on a stick, and \u201casado\u201d means roasted, and together, \u201cen vara asado\u201d sounds like \u201cembarazado.\u201d These shrimp are soaked with an adobo that becomes a crunchy crust when grilled. This take on the dish, which spread from Puerto Vallarta on the Pacific coast of Mexico to beaches all over the country, combines guajillo chiles and chiles de \u00e1rbol with the surprising addition of Mexican chocolate. The chocolate rounds out the sharpness of the adobo and provides a caramelized finish. Simmered extra adobo is delicious for dipping the shrimp hot off the coals.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/04/dining/29CAMARONESREX/merlin_190467330_64a9033c-39c0-4473-865d-0a219eae88c9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "seafood, skewers and kebabs, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "guajillo chiles, mexican chocolate, shrimp, tomatoes", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 114}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ripe tomatoes", "4 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded", "2 to 3 dried chiles de \u00e1rbol, stemmed", "3 garlic cloves, peeled", "2 scallions, white and light green parts only, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 ounces Mexican chocolate (see Tip), grated", "1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt, more for seasoning", "2 pounds large head-on shrimp or headless shrimp, with or without shells", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, combine the whole tomatoes, guajillo chiles, chiles de \u00e1rbol and garlic cloves, and cover with water by an inch or two.
