{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato Focaccia with Oyster Mushrooms", "description": "I came across a focaccia recipe from the Appulia region of Italy that incorporates mashed potatoes into the dough in Carol Field\u2019s book, \u201cFocaccia.\u201d I thought I would need to reformulate my flour amounts, but I found that the dough was too moist without the amount of flour I normally use. It\u2019s much easier to make this dough using a stand mixer than to mix it by hand because it\u2019s quite sticky. The bread is moist and savory, perfect with the oyster mushroom topping. You can use other wild mushrooms such as maitakes instead, but I find oyster mushrooms the easiest to find and the least expensive.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/16/science/14recipehealthmushrooms/14recipehealthmushrooms-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H50M", "recipeYield": "1 large focaccia, serving 12", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, snack, breads", "keywords": "appetizer, dessert, dairy-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 216, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "264 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon / 4 grams active dry yeast", "1/2 cup / 120 ml lukewarm water", "3/4 cup / 90 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "8 ounces / 225 g potatoes, such as Yukon gold, peeled and diced", "1 teaspoon / 4 grams active dry yeast", "1 cup / 240 ml lukewarm water", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3/4 to 1 cup / 100 to 125 grams unbleached all-purpose flour, as needed", "2 cups / 250 grams whole wheat flour or durum flour", "1 3/4 teaspoons/ 12 grams fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage", "1 to 2 garlic cloves, to taste (optional)", "1/2 pound oyster mushrooms", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "12 to 24 small sage leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make sponge.
