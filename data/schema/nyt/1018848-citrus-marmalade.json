{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Citrus Marmalade", "description": "It's decidedly more involved than your average preserves, but homemade marmalade is worth the effort. High amounts of natural pectin, acid and bitterness make citrus fruits (namely oranges, lemons and grapefruits) ideal for preserving.\u00a0And there are many paths to a satisfying result:\u00a0Some recipes call for boiling the whole fruit until it's tender, then slicing it before simmering it again in a sugar syrup for a very thick, nearly opaque marmalade. Others use only\u00a0the peel and juice, discarding the insides for a crystal-clear result. Our recipe takes a third tack, using the whole fruit, separated with some savvy knife skills for a marmalade that lands somewhere between the other two.\u00a0Perhaps the best part of making your own marmalade is the ability to control the texture of your final product. Do you prefer a thick-cut marmalade? Or one with a more uniform, delicate texture? No matter your answer, be sure to soak the sliced peels for at least eight hours to allow them to fully soften, or else they might become tough \u2014 more candied peel than evenly cooked preserves.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/07/dining/07JAMGUIDE13/07JAMGUIDE13-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 4 cups (4 8-ounce jars)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "fall, winter, grapefruit, lemon, orange", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds/907 grams oranges, grapefruit or lemons, washed", "4 cups/800 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters fresh lemon juice (from about 2 lemons)", "Add-ins (optional, see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the citrus: Using a sharp knife, slice off the top and bottom of the citrus so it sits sturdily on the cutting board.
