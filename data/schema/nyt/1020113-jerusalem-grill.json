But you don't need to make it with the livers and hearts. \u201cI like a little funk in there,\u201d Solomonov told me, \u201cbut I get it if you don\u2019t like that, if it freaks you out.\u201d So omit the offal if you want. \u201cThe dish is as much about the spicing, anyway,\u201d Solomonov said. Serve the meat mounded onto a drift of hummus, as you might spoon a thick rag\u00f9 on top of polenta, or alone beside a salad. Solomonov likes it as a sandwich. \u201cEat mixed grill in a pita,\u201d he said. \u201cEat it with some onion and tehina and a pickle, and it\u2019s so satisfying. It\u2019s a taste of Jerusalem at the end of the night.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/24/magazine/24mag-eat-slideshow-slide-U42I/24mag-eat-slideshow-slide-U42I-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry", "keywords": "baharat, boneless chicken thighs, cumin, fenugreek, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 175}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "1 large red onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons plus a pinch of kosher salt", "2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground fenugreek", "1 teaspoon\u00a0baharat", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "2\u00bd pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, or a combination of 1\u00bd pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, \u00bd pound chicken hearts and \u00bd pound chicken livers, trimmed and cut into nickel-size pieces", "1 lemon, halved", "Cooked Basmati or other long-grain rice", "Israeli salad, pita bread, sliced pickles and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019619-5-minute-hummus\">hummus</a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make caramelized onions: Swirl 2 tablespoons oil into a medium skillet set over medium heat.
