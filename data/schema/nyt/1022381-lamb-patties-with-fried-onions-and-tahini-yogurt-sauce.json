These well-seasoned, simple-to-make patties are inspired by kofta, and are spiced with a fragrant mixture. You can season the meat up to a day ahead, which cuts down on kitchen time. Folded into warm pita bread, doused with tahini sauce and topped with fried onions, these burgers may not be standard cookout fare, but everyone loves them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/07/dining/02Tanisrex2-burgers/02Tanisrex2-burgers-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, main course", "keywords": "lamb, lemon, tahini, yogurt, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 226}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds ground lamb", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 cup finely chopped scallions, white and green parts", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "2 tablespoons chopped mint", "1/2 teaspoon minced garlic (from 2 garlic cloves)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed", "1 large onion, sliced into 1/4-inch half-moons", "Pita or other flatbread, for serving (optional)", "3 tablespoons tahini", "3 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 medium lemon)", "2 large garlic cloves, finely grated", "Pinch of ground cayenne", "1 1/2 cups plain whole-milk yogurt", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put lamb in a medium bowl.
