{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Berry Blitz Torte", "description": "Blitz means \u201clightning\u201d in German, referring to\u00a0the lightning-quick way\u00a0this old-fashioned cake comes together, at least compared with the more ornately frosted tortes popular a century ago. Buttery, nutmeg-scented batter is swirled with meringue and sprinkled with pecans before baking. The meringue, which browns on top but stays soft inside, takes the place of icing while the nuts add flavor and crunch. A whipped cream and berry filling makes the whole thing incredibly soft and rich. You can bake the cake layers up to 12 hours ahead, but it\u2019s best to fill them with cream and berries within 3 hours of serving so they don\u2019t get soggy.
