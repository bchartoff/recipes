When she was in high school, Manzke came across the classic recipe for \u201cfood for the gods\u201d in a thin pamphlet of Filipino desserts, and she made the bars again and again, learning how to produce a consistently tender, chewy batch: Don\u2019t overcream the butter, and don\u2019t use a light hand with the dates. Manzke sells fresh bars at R\u00e9publique, but know that at home the cooled, cut bars store well in the freezer, ready to pop out and defrost at a moment's notice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/07/magazine/07mag-eat-slideshow-slide-X5CG/07mag-eat-slideshow-slide-X5CG-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 24 bars", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, medjool dates, sugar, walnut, dessert, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 400}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 414, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "131 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 2/3 cups/340 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 cups/400 grams large Medjool dates, pitted and roughly chopped into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 pound/450 grams unsalted butter (4 sticks), at room temperature", "2 1/3 packed cups/515 grams dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "6 eggs", "2 1/3 cups/280 grams walnuts, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325, and line a 13-by-18-inch sheet pan with parchment paper.
