{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beans and Greens Stew With Doenjang", "description": "In this deeply comforting stew, the hardest part is washing and chopping the greens, which is to say, not very hard. Earthy-sweet Swiss chard, especially rainbow chard, tastes beautiful here, but coarsely chopped spinach, kale, mustard or radish greens, napa cabbage or broccoli rabe would be lovely, too. Canned cannellini beans, crushed lightly with a wooden spoon, thicken the gentle, savory broth. The key to this dish lies in how you layer each ingredient into the pot: The onion and scallions are first browned to start an umami-rich base; the Korean fermented soybean paste, doenjang (see Tip), is bloomed in oil to awaken its deep, salty funkiness; and then the honey is caramelized slightly for sweetness and floral complexity.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/18/dining/EK-greens-and-beans-stew-with-doenjang/merlin_196451808_f4e0cd09-98c9-43ab-8be7-66c1be5c517b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "cannellini beans, doenjang, swiss chard, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 796}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large red onion, halved and thinly sliced", "4 large scallions, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "Salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons doenjang (fermented soybean paste; see Tip), plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon honey", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1 (15.5-ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1/2 bunch Swiss or rainbow chard, coarsely chopped with stems (4 packed cups)", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated", "Cooked white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium and add 2 tablespoons oil, the onion and scallions.
