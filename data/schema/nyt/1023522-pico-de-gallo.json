{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pico de Gallo", "description": "This recipe is a classic pico de gallo preparation with the exception of the inclusion of two types of spicy chiles, jalape\u00f1o and serrano. Their flavors are so different: Jalape\u00f1os are much more vegetal and can lean into bell pepper and poblano flavors, while serranos are much sharper, crisp and almost cucumber-like. They complement each other very well, and are used in many Mexican salsas. Serve pico de gallo with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023501-empanadas-de-chipilin\">empanadas de\u00a0chipil\u00edn</a> or on the side with your favorite tacos or grilled meats.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
