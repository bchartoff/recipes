{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato Waffles With Smoked Trout", "description": "These savory waffles were inspired by the Solomon Gundy waffles at M. Wells Steakhouse in Long Island City, Queens. It starts with a mashed potato waffle batter, which is baked in a waffle iron until very crisp around the edges. They are then opulently topped with cr\u00e8me fraiche (or sour cream), smoked trout and trout or salmon roe. If you can\u2019t find smoked trout, smoked salmon makes a fine substitute. Or try them topped with scrambled or fried eggs. Potato waffles make a terrific savory brunch dish, a light supper, or appetizer before a dinner party \u2014 they are unexpected in a festive, delightful way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/02APPE1_SPAN/02APPE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 waffles", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner", "keywords": "appetizer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 45}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 340, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "394 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (14 ounces), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes", "Coarse salt", "1 cup whole milk", "3 grams active dry yeast (1 teaspoon)", "5 grams granulated sugar (1 teaspoon)", "250 grams all-purpose flour (2 cups)", "5 grams baking soda (1 teaspoon)", "7 grams baking powder (1 1/2 teaspoons)", "2 large eggs, separated", "1 cup sour cream ", "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for waffle iron", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or more sour cream, for serving ", "6 ounces smoked trout, for serving", "2 ounces trout or salmon roe, for serving", "Lemon wedges, for serving "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Boil potatoes in a medium saucepan of salted water until tender, about 8 minutes.
