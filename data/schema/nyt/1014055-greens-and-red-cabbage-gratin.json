{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Greens and Red Cabbage Gratin", "description": "Like blueberries, red cabbage contains anthocyanins, phytochemicals that some experts believe may have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The nutritional attributes of red cabbage don\u2019t just come from the anthocyanins. All vegetables in the cabbage family \u2014 the brassicas, also known as cruciferous vegetables \u2014 also are packed with sulfur compounds that may help protect the body. I thought this Proven\u00e7al gratin served six, but it\u2019s so good that recently four of us made a meal of it with no trouble. It\u2019s a great vegetarian main dish.
