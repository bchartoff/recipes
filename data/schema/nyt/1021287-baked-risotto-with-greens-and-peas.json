{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Risotto With Greens and Peas", "description": "This easy baked risotto eliminates the constant stirring required in traditional risotto recipes. It\u2019s laden with vegetables, namely kale and spinach, but other leafy greens like Swiss chard or collard greens would work equally well. If you happen to have some extra asparagus, sub it in for the peas. This risotto makes a great starter or side dish, but you can also turn it into a vegetarian main course by using vegetable or mushroom stock in place of the chicken broth, and topping it with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, a fried egg or crispy tofu slices. Leftovers can be refrigerated for two days and reheated with more broth, or repurposed into crunchy rice cakes or arancini. Simply form into patties or balls, coat in bread crumbs and shallow-fry until golden and crunchy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/dining/kc-green-risotto/merlin_176510055_e9146cdb-15dd-4a58-a0db-d9884b386655-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, casseroles, grains and rice, one pot, main course, side dish", "keywords": "arborio or carnaroli rice, garlic, kale, onion, parmesan, peas, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3560}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion", "1 small garlic clove, minced", "1 cup Arborio rice (about 7 ounces)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 ounces green or lacinato kale (about \u2153 bunch), stems separated and thinly sliced, leaves stacked and cut into 1/4-inch-thick ribbons (about 4 packed cups)", "3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "4 ounces baby spinach (about 4 packed cups)", "1 cup frozen peas, thawed", "3/4 cup grated Parmesan (3 ounces), plus more for garnish", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
