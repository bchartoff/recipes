{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Tuna With Herbs and Olives", "description": "Here, grilled tuna is smothered with a mixture of flavorful herbs, made more potent by the addition of chopped olives and a little raw garlic. A mix of parsley, basil, chives, chervil and marjoram, for example, would be splendid, as would one of cilantro, mint and basil.  (I would rule out only thyme, tarragon and rosemary, unless you use them in minuscule quantities.) If you don't have a grill, many readers have baked it at 425 and been happy with the results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/21/dining/recipes-grilledtuna/recipes-grilledtuna-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "main course, olives, tuna, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 171}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 495, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "526 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds tuna, about 1 inch thick, 2 or 4 steaks", "Extra-virgin olive oil as needed", "Salt and pepper", "1/4 cup pitted oil-cured olives, finely chopped", "About 1 cup mixed tender fresh herbs", "1 teaspoon minced garlic, optional", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start a charcoal or gas grill; fire should be medium-high and rack about 4 inches from heat source."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When fire is ready, rub tuna lightly with olive oil, then sprinkle it with salt and pepper.
