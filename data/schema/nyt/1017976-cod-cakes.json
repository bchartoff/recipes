Poach the fillets in bay-leaf-scented water, then flake the cooled meat into a New Englandish mirepoix of saut\u00e9ed onions and celery. Eggs and cracker crumbs will help bind everything together below a drift of spice. Make sure to leave some time to chill the resulting patties in the refrigerator \u2013 the cold will help them set up so they don\u2019t fall apart in the saut\u00e9 pan. A light smear of mayonnaise on the exterior of the cakes before you fry them will encourage the most glorious crust. Serve with a thatch of green salad, a bowl of chowder or a neat pile of slaw.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/09/dining/09COOKING-PADTHAI7/09COOKING-PADTHAI7-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings as a main course, 6 to 8 servings as an appetizer", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, cod, Old Bay seasoning, saltine crackers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1601}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 361, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "443 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 peppercorns", "1 bay leaf", "1 lemon, cut into eighths", "1 pound cod fillets, or other white flaky fish", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 ribs celery, trimmed, peeled and diced", "1 medium-size yellow onion, peeled and diced", "2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "1 heaping tablespoon mayonnaise, homemade or store-bought", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 eggs", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning, Lawry\u2019s Seasoned Salt or 1 teaspoon paprika and 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or to taste", "1 \u2018\u2018sleeve\u2019\u2019 unsalted saltine crackers, crushed, or 1 heaping cup panko bread crumbs", "1/2 bunch parsley, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup neutral oil, like canola"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a shallow, wide pan with high sides with about an inch of water, and set it over high heat.
