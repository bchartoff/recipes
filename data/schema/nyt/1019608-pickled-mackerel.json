It\u2019s simple and foolproof to prepare, and the time it takes is mostly unattended. He serves it plain or over rice that\u2019s been dressed with some cucumber and toasted sesame seeds. I also tried seasoning the rice with a couple of spoonfuls of the leftover vinegar marinade plus grated ginger, black sesame seeds, minced scallions and diced avocado, and Mr. Connaughton seconded that idea, as well as the notion of serving the pickled fish Scandinavian-style, with sour cream, sweet onions and boiled potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/10ConnaughtonRex/10ConnaughtonRex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "pickles, project, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, kombu, mackerel, rice vinegar, sushi rice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 347, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "673 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 mackerel fillet, about 1 pound, skinned (Atlantic, Spanish or Japanese saba mackerel)", "Fine sea salt", "3 cups unseasoned rice vinegar", "A 6-inch piece dried kombu", "1/2 cup sugar", "3/4 cup medium-grain sushi rice", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped and peeled English cucumber"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove any pin bones from the fish.
