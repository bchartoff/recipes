{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brioche Chestnut Stuffing", "description": "Stuffing with made from eggy brioche and roasted chestnuts is a Thanksgiving classic. This one, seasoned with celery, onion and sage, and a little diced fennel for sweetness and depth, sticks relatively close to tradition. Use it to stuff a turkey, if you like, but it\u2019s even better baked separately in a shallow casserole dish, so the top can get nice and crisp. If you\u2019d like to bake it ahead, you can do so up to 6 hours in advance. Just before serving, reheat it in a 350-degree oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/07/dining/07stuffingrex/07stuffingrex-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "brioche, chestnut, fennel, fall, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 470}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 280, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "397 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14- to 16-ounce) brioche loaf, torn into 1-inch pieces", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), plus more for the pan", "1 large onion, diced", "2 large celery ribs, thinly sliced", "1/2 cup diced fennel (about 1/2 small fennel bulb)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh sage, chopped", "5 ounces roasted, peeled chestnuts, roughly chopped", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 1/2 cups turkey or chicken stock", "2 large eggs", "1/4 cup chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange brioche pieces in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.
