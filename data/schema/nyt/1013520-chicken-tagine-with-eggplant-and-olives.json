{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Tagine With Eggplant and Olives", "description": "Priorat, near the Mediterranean coast of Spain and a stone\u2019s throw from Barcelona, produces wines with dark fruit flavors, spice, bold complexity and ample alcohol. To compete with reds like these, the food alongside must take no prisoners.It would have been simple enough to sear some rib-eyes, lamb chops or lusty sausages. But I looked across the Mediterranean to North Africa and came up with a tagine in which chicken is coated with robust spices and becomes more than mere white noise. Eggplant and olives round out the dish, and a splash of sherry vinegar brightens the sauce.If you have yet to equip your kitchen with a genuine terra-cotta tagine, you can cook the dish in a covered saut\u00e9 pan or a fancy-pants tagine of enameled cast iron.
