Most often topped with a za\u2019atar and olive oil mixture as they are here, these simple flatbreads are now often found coated with varied ingredients, such as cheese, labneh, pepper paste, eggs and even sweet spreads. But the traditional za\u2019atar still reigns supreme. You can roll the dough out with a pin, but, for the fluffiest and softest version of this flatbread, stretch the dough by hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Reem Kassis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/20/dining/15OILREX1-manaqeesh/15OILREX1-manaqeesh-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 manaqeesh", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, snack, breads", "keywords": "flour, olive oil, za\u2019atar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 116}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 cups/450 grams all-purpose or bread flour", "1 1/4 cups/150 grams whole-wheat or white whole-wheat flour", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 teaspoons instant yeast", "1 to 2 cups lukewarm water", "3/4 cup/60 grams za\u2019atar spice blend (see Tip)", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, mix both flours, the salt and sugar.
