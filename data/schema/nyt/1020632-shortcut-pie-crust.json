{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shortcut Pie Crust", "description": "This recipe and method make a distinctly tender, crisp crust. Unlike rolling, which can toughen pastry by developing the gluten in the dough, grating breaks \u2014 or shortens \u2014 the protein chains, which leads to extra tenderness. Pressing the grated pastry directly into the pie plate makes patisserie-thin crusts achievable, without much practice. It\u2019s key to thoroughly chill the dough before grating and to pull it up higher than the rim of the dish to allow for shrinkage. Swap this recipe in as the base of any sweet pie, adjusting the thickness accordingly. Deeper pies made in dishes without removable bases benefit from slightly thicker crusts, whereas fluted tart crusts are best whisper thin. Make double the dough and freeze half, so you have an excuse to make pie another day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clare de Boer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/dining/15pierex4/15pierex4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H50M", "recipeYield": "One 8- to 11-inch pie or tart crust", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "butter, confectioners' sugar, egg, flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 271}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/60 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, passed through a sieve", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "9 tablespoons/130 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "2 large egg yolks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the flour, confectioners\u2019 sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor.

Pay attention to the seam between the sides and the base, making sure it is the same thickness as the rest of the pastry: The crust should form an even layer that is about 1/4-inch thick.
