{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy, Lemony Chicken Breasts With Croutons and Greens", "description": "A post-marinade is exactly what it sounds like: a flavorful mixture you sink meat or fish into after it cooks. Often used with grilled meats, the technique works great with seared proteins as well, especially boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which don\u2019t have a lot of flavor on their own. These breasts are cooked using a combination sear-steam method that builds flavor and keeps lean breasts juicy. Finish with a tangy-spicy combination of lemon, garlic and red-pepper flakes and you\u2019ll reap all the benefits of a traditional marinade without having to plan ahead. If you have thinner breasts or cutlets, this is a particularly wonderful use for them, since they don\u2019t have a lot of time to pick up color and flavor before they cook through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/25/dining/dp-chile-lemon-chicken/merlin_169349814_1ffaab15-aa71-4b6c-8001-1e93970f2f64-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "chicken breast, garlic, lemon zest, lettuce, oregano, red pepper flakes, dairy-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 344}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 slices crusty bread (about 3/4-inch thick)", "6 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest plus 1/4 cup lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)", "1 garlic clove, grated or finely chopped", "1 teaspoon dried oregano or thyme (or 1 tablespoon fresh)", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, to taste", "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1 1/2 to 2 pounds)", "2 small heads Little Gem lettuce or 1 romaine heart, leaves separated and torn into bite-size pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
