{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy White Beans With Pecorino and Pancetta", "description": "These superfast, incredibly delicious beans are inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017305-pasta-alla-gricia\">pasta alla gricia</a>, a classic Roman dish that is similar to <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12965-spaghetti-carbonara\">pasta carbonara</a> but without the egg yolks. Because the dish is so simple, it helps to use good pancetta (or guanciale, if you can find it) and not the pre-diced kind. (It often comes in a roll; just unroll it and slice it up. You could even use good thick-cut bacon instead of pancetta, if that is easier to find.) Cut into fat batons, the pork crisps up into chewy, salty little nuggets that contrast with the soft beans. The starch from the beans along with the fat from the pancetta plus Pecorino cheese and hot water all emulsify into a creamy, peppery sauce when stirred together vigorously. Because of its salty ingredients, this dish is unlikely to need added salt, but taste at the end and add it if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/23/multimedia/sdg-creamy-white-beans-flch/sdg-creamy-white-beans-flch-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, beans, main course, side dish", "keywords": "black pepper, garlic, lemon, olive oil, one pot, pancetta, pecorino, white beans, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil\u00a0", "4 ounces pancetta, sliced into batons\u00a0", "5 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped\u00a0", "3 (15-ounce) cans white beans, drained\u00a0", "2 tablespoons lemon juice (from about 1/2 lemon)", "1/2 cup/1 3/4 ounces grated Pecorino cheese, plus more for serving\u00a0", "1 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste", "1/2 cup hot water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot or Dutch oven, warm the olive oil over medium heat.
