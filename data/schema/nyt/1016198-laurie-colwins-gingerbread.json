{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Laurie Colwin\u2019s Gingerbread", "description": "The writer Laurie Colwin had an obsession with gingerbread, publishing a few different essays and recipes exploring its charms. In the essay that precedes this moist, cakelike rendition, from her book \u201cHome Cooking,\u201d she writes that it is \u201chome food\u201d \u2014 not fancy restaurant food, that is, but soothing cold-weather food that is simple to make, ideal for an afternoon spent holed up indoors. The essay is also a paean to Steen\u2019s cane syrup, from Louisiana, which comes in cheerful yellow cans. Steen\u2019s is easy to find online, if not at your local supermarket, but the recipe does not suffer if you use another brand of light molasses instead. Serve the cake plain with whipped cream, or with fruit and a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or glazed with lemon icing, as Ms. Colwin often did.
