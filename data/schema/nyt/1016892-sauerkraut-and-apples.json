But in Baltimore, which has a strong eastern European and German immigrant history, the holiday table demands something else. \u201cThe absence of sauerkraut when turkey is present, Thanksgiving included, is unthinkable, comparable to potatoes without gravy or crisp French fries without ketchup,\u201d wrote John Shields, the chef and owner of Gertrude\u2019s restaurant in Baltimore, in his cookbook \u201cChesapeake Bay Cooking.\u201d (Sauerkraut is a mainstay well beyond Thanksgiving; Gertrude\u2019s hosts an annual Krautfest in January.) \nTraditionally, homemakers fermented the cabbage in earthenware crocks in their cellars, but these days the fresh stuff is available to buy. On Thanksgiving, it\u2019s often simply served as a side, or incorporated into dishes like this, in which the sauerkraut is braised in beer with bacon and apples.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jennifer Steinhauer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19MARYLAND/19MARYLAND-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apples, bacon, sauerkraut, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 89}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 220, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "850 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons butter", "4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 small onion, thinly sliced", "3 tart apples, such as Stayman, Pippin, Granny Smith or Jonagold, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced", "2 pounds sauerkraut, drained and rinsed", "1 bottle (12 ounces) beer (you may substitute apple cider)", "Black pepper, to taste", "1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat.
