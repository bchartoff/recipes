{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Kouign-Amann", "description": "A yeast-risen pastry with soft layers, deep buttery flavor and a chewy, caramelized top, this recipe, adapted from Nicolas Henry of the Montreal patisserie Au Kouign-Amann, celebrates the classic Breton kouign-amann, traditionally made as a round skillet cake and served as slices. There\u2019s no shortcut and no substitute for the repetition needed to perfect this pastry. But you are in good hands: The process is a series of simple steps, with plenty of opportunities to make ahead. And the results of your efforts are sure to please, whether it accompanies your morning coffee, serves as a delightful afternoon snack or stunningly ends a meal. You\u2019ll need an oven-safe nonstick skillet for this cake. A cast-iron skillet will work, but will produce a deeper, more caramelized result.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/25/multimedia/20komolaferex-kouign-jcbg/20komolaferex-kouign-jcbg-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H30M", "recipeYield": "1 (12-inch) kouign-amann", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, pastries, project, dessert", "keywords": "cardamom, clove, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, instant yeast, orange zest, unsalted butter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 416}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups/320 grams warm water (110 degrees)", "3 (1/4-ounce) packets/21 grams instant dry yeast", "3 3/4 cups/495 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt (such as Morton\u2019s table salt), plus more for sprinkling", "1/4 cup/60 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil (optional)", "1 3/4 cups/395 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon fine salt (such as Morton\u2019s table salt)", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon orange zest", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "2 to 3 cardamom pods, crushed", "2 to 3 whole cloves, crushed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add the warm water and sprinkle in the yeast.
