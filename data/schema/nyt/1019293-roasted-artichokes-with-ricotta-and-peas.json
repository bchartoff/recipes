{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Artichokes With Ricotta and Peas", "description": "The key to roasting artichokes is to make sure to trim away all of the tough, leathery outer leaves until only the soft pale ones in the center remain. It may seem like you\u2019re throwing a lot away \u2014 and you are. But because roasting encourages crispness, any borderline-fibrous bits will toughen up even more, becoming impossible to chew. So for the most tender vegetables, stay on the side of over-trimming, rather than under-trimming. In this recipe, the browned artichokes are tossed with fresh herbs, peas and plenty of olive oil (use your best bottle), then scattered on top of lemony ricotta cheese. Serve this, with or without crostini, as an appetizer or part of a light supper with a salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/dining/09apperex2/merlin_137521020_09345c1a-3bcb-47f2-8030-d5ec108eeb04-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, artichoke, peas, ricotta, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 42}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon, cut in half", "4 medium artichokes, or 8 to 10 small or baby artichokes", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for garnish", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1 cup fresh peas (from about 1 pound of peas in the pod) or frozen peas", "2 cups fresh ricotta cheese", "Finely grated zest from 1 lemon", "1/4 cup torn mint or dill, or a combination", "Flaky sea salt, to taste", "Fresh lemon juice, to taste", "Crostini, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Squeeze one lemon half into a large bowl of cold water.
