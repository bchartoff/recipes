As with all simple cooking, ingredients are key here. Don\u2019t skimp on the veal, or the tuna, or the mayonnaise. They all mingle together to create something better than the sum of their parts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, summer, tuna, veal eye round, vegetables", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds boned veal eye round", "1 (7-ounce) container best-quality Italian tuna, shredded", "1 medium yellow onion, peeled, chopped in quarters and stuck with 2 cloves", "1 celery rib, roughly chopped", "1 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 parsley sprig", "1 1/2 cups chicken broth, preferably low-sodium or homemade", "\u00bd teaspoon kosher salt", "10 black peppercorns, ground", "1 bay leaf", "1 1/2 cups dry white wine", "2 egg yolks", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 (12-ounce) container best-quality Italian tuna in olive oil, finely chopped, with its oil", "2 anchovies, rinsed, dried and minced", "1 tablespoon caper brine", "Lemon juice", "Veal broth (see above)", "Kosher salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If necessary, tie the veal with cotton string, so that it resembles a salami.
