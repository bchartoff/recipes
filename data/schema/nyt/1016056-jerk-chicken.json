It is Jamaica to the bone, aromatic and smoky, sweet but insistently hot. All of its traditional ingredients grow in the island\u2019s lush green interior: fresh ginger, thyme and scallions; Scotch bonnet peppers; and the sweet wood of the allspice tree, which burns to a fragrant smoke. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sauce, it\u2019s a procedure,\u201d Jerome Williams, a Jamaican-born Brooklyn resident, told The Times in 2008 on a Sunday in Prospect Park, where families arrive as early as 6 a.m. for lakeside grilling spots, a few of which are actually authorized by the parks department. \u201cIt has to be hot, but it cannot only be hot, or you get no joy from it.\u201d This recipe delivers that joy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/20/dining/recipes-jerkchicken/recipes-jerkchicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "chicken, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 465}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 790, "unsaturatedFatContent": "40 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "58 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "429 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 3 1/2- to 4-pound chickens, quartered, or 8 whole legs, or 5 to 6 pounds bone-in, skin-on thighs", "1 large bunch scallions (about 8), white and green parts", "2 shallots, peeled and halved", "4 to 6 Scotch bonnet chili peppers, stems removed, or habaneros", "1 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped", "6 garlic cloves, peeled", "1/4 cup fresh thyme leaves, or 1 tablespoon dried", "2 tablespoons ground allspice, more for sprinkling", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon salt, more for sprinkling", "1 tablespoon black pepper", "1/2 cup vegetable oil", "1 tablespoon white or apple cider vinegar", "Freshly squeezed juice of 2 limes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "At least 1 day before cooking, pat chicken dry with paper towels.

If necessary, push coals to one side of grill to create indirect heat. Add two large handfuls of soaked pimento (allspice) wood sticks and chips (see note) or other aromatic wood chips to coals, then close grill.
