{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Frozen Strawberry-Coconut Smoothie With Pomegranate Molasses", "description": "Fruity pomegranate molasses is the perfect sweetener for this thick strawberry smoothie.\n\nThis summer I bought a flat of strawberries, and soon afterward realized that they were going to go off before I had a chance to use them. So I hulled them and froze them in small freezer bags (a heaping cup, or 6 ounces, per bag), and now I\u2019m using them for smoothies. When I was working on this smoothie I felt that it needed something to sweeten it, but what? I looked in my cupboard and saw a bottle of pomegranate molasses, and voil\u00e0! Now I know that pomegranate molasses, with its fruity, tangy yet sweet flavor, is perfect for red fruit smoothies of all kinds. This one is enriched with cashews, soaked in water for a few hours or overnight, chia seeds (also soaked), and oatmeal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/01/science/02recipehealthcoco/02recipehealthcoco-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 generous serving", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 22}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 419, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "31 milligrams", "sugarContent": "32 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons rolled oats", "2 to 3 tablespoons hot or boiling water (enough to just cover the oats)", "1 heaping cup frozen strawberries (about 6 ounces)", "1 tablespoon soaked chia seeds (1 teaspoon unsoaked)", "6 cashews, soaked overnight or for several hours in water to cover (about 1/2 ounce) and drained", "1/3 cup light coconut milk", "2/3 cup fresh or commercial orange juice", "1 1/2 teaspoons pomegranate molasses"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the rolled oats and hot or boiling water in a small bowl or ramekin and leave until the oatmeal is soft, about 15 minutes (alternatively, soak in cold water overnight)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients (including the soaked oatmeal) in a blender and blend at high speed for 1 minute.
