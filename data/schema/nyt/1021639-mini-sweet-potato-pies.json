{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mini Sweet Potato Pies", "description": "Coconut milk gives the spiced sweet potato filling in these small pies a delicate custard texture, and coconut flakes on top deliver a toasted nuttiness. This recipe calls for pressing two dozen tiny crusts into a mini-muffin tin, which may seem tedious, but is easy with the help of a wine or champagne cork, which is the ideal size for tamping down the graham cracker crumbs. These two-bite (OK, one-bite) pies need to be chilled, so they\u2019re ideal for making ahead and can be refrigerated for up to three days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/13/dining/13BAKING-2/13BAKING-2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "2 dozen mini pies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "coconut flakes, coconut milk, graham cracker, sweet potato, fall, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 178}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium sweet potato (10 ounces/285 grams), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters unsweetened full-fat coconut milk, well shaken", "1 teaspoon dark rum or vanilla extract", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/45 grams unsweetened coconut flakes", "5 whole graham crackers, finely ground (2/3 cup/80 grams)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start the filling: Prepare a steamer.
