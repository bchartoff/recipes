{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grand Green Aioli", "description": "\u201cLe grand aioli\u201d is a classic Proven\u00e7al meal of vegetables and steamed seafood, centered on a rich and lemony garlic-laden aioli for dipping. Here, the sauce is vibrant with fresh parsley. This summery dish features a colorful mix of crunchy vegetables and crisp lettuces alongside steamed nutty edamame, to keep it vegetarian. But poached shrimp, rotisserie chicken, canned tuna and hard-boiled eggs would all be welcome for dipping. Very little cooking is required \u2014 just some quick boiling \u2014 making this perfect for a stress-free weeknight dinner or a celebratory get-together. Leftover aioli is a terrific sandwich spread, as well as a versatile dressing for roasted potatoes or pasta salad.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a> .", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/17/dining/KC-grand-green-aioli/merlin_193376010_cce8568c-ad2e-49e6-8fa0-6d10e19497a5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, vegetables, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "egg yolks, lettuce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 253}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 pound frozen edamame in pods", "8 ounces small heads of lettuce (such as Little Gem, endive or romaine), leaves separated\u00a0", "2 large egg yolks", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup safflower or canola oil", "1 packed cup flat-leaf parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the vegetables: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
