{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Chicken and Rice With Ginger and Cumin", "description": "Inspired by Indian flavors, this one-pot chicken-and-rice pilaf comes together in under an hour by taking advantage of spices that pack a punch: Mustard seeds bring heat, cumin adds nutty notes and cardamom provides depth and warmth \u2014 and all of the spices are toasted in oil and butter, which concentrates their flavor. Golden raisins lend a touch of sweetness. To make it a vegetarian side, omit the chicken and use vegetable broth or even water in place of the chicken broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/dining/kc-chicken-pilaf/merlin_171784317_b489dcab-d7f9-4bef-ad4d-bfbd1dcdb45f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, poultry, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "cardamom, carrot, chicken thigh, cilantro, cumin, ginger, raisin, rice, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1193}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, each thigh cut into 2 equal pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 large shallots, thinly sliced (about 1 cup)", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 tablespoon brown mustard seeds", "1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds", "1/4 teaspoon ground green cardamom (optional)", "2 cups basmati rice (about 14 ounces)", "1/4 cup golden raisins (about 1 1/2 ounces)", "3 cups low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth", "2 medium carrots (about 6 ounces), peeled and very thinly sliced into rounds (about 1 cup)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "Hot sauce and yogurt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium.
