{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramel Peach Skillet Pie", "description": "In this decadent pie baked in a skillet, fresh peaches are coated in caramel before being topped with a homemade puff pastry crust. The trick to controlling the sweetness here is making sure to cook the caramel until it\u2019s very dark brown but not burned. You\u2019re looking for the color of an Irish setter: deep brown with a reddish cast. The puff pastry is a shortcut version (often called quick or rough puff pastry) that\u2019s less labor-intensive than the classic kind. Its texture is somewhere between flaky pie dough and typical puff pastry, with a deeply buttery flavor. You can make it up to three days ahead (or longer if you freeze it). This said, purchased all-butter puff pastry is a fine substitute. You\u2019ll need a 12- to 14-ounce package.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/26/multimedia/clark-peaches/clark-peaches-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, peach, tapioca, vanilla bean, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 280}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 538, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "196 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/283 grams unsalted butter (2 1/2 sticks), cubed", "2 1/4 cups/280 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "9 cups sliced peaches or nectarines, or a combination (from 3 pounds/1.3 kilograms)", "2/3 cup/150 grams sugar, plus 1 tablespoon", "2 1/2 tablespoons/23 grams quick-cooking tapioca", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste, or 1 vanilla bean, scraped", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom or cinnamon", "Pinch sea salt", "1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste (optional)", "Cinnamon sugar, for sprinkling", "Ice cream, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the puff pastry: Cube 1 cup/226 grams of butter (2 sticks) and place in the freezer while you measure out remaining ingredients."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, pulse to combine flour and salt.
