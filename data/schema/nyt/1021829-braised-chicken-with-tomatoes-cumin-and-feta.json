{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Chicken With Tomatoes, Cumin and Feta", "description": "Pleasantly reminiscent of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014721-shakshuka-with-feta\">shakshuka</a>, this one-pot dinner has a similar spiced tomato sauce, but uses crispy skinned, cumin-laced chicken thighs instead of eggs. The harissa-spiked sauce is best spooned over an herbed rice or enjoyed with crusty bread to scoop up the melty feta. Roasted vegetables like kale or broccolini would round out the meal nicely. Harissa tends to differ in heat level from brand to brand, so adjust the heat accordingly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/26/dining/yf-braised-chicken/merlin_182444814_ca1b1360-f4b9-4377-8053-33fae1f3a9be-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, cumin, feta, red onion, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 477}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 thighs)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 teaspoons plus 1 tablespoon ground cumin", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium red onion, thinly sliced (about 2 \u00bd cups)", "3 large garlic cloves, minced or grated", "1 to 2 tablespoons harissa paste", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "1/2 cup crumbled feta", "1/4 packed cup roughly chopped cilantro or flat-leaf parsley leaves and fine stems", "Crusty bread or herbed rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the chicken dry, trim away excess fat, then season well all over with salt, pepper and 2 teaspoons cumin."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy 12-inch skillet over medium until shimmering.
