{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chickpea Stew With Orzo and Mustard Greens", "description": "A complex and colorful chickpea stew, this is rich with vegetables, olive oil and Parmesan cheese. You can vary the vegetables to use what you\u2019ve got. Here, I keep to the basics, adding carrots for sweetness, fennel or celery for depth, cherry tomatoes for looks. Tender greens, wilted into the bubbling mixture at the end, are optional, but they do add a bright, almost herbal note. I particularly love using baby mustard greens, which are pleasantly peppery. But spinach, arugula and kale work well, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/30/dining/mc-chickpea-stew-with-orzo-and-mustard-greens/merlin_145792992_ef9f8c6e-3dde-46b1-adf0-b1f2cf2558e5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weeknight", "keywords": "chickpea, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2378}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 189, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "640 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped", "1 small fennel bulb or 2 celery stalks, chopped", "1 medium onion, chopped", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "Pinch crushed red pepper flakes", "2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary (optional)", "2 cups chicken or vegetable broth (or water)", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained", "3/4 cup roughly chopped cherry or grape tomatoes", "1/2 cup whole-wheat or regular orzo", "1 quart loosely packed baby mustard greens or spinach (about 5 ounces)", "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper", "Chopped scallions, for garnish (optional)", "1/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.
