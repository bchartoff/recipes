{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Roasted Cauliflower With Feta and Garlic", "description": "Cauliflower undergoes a few stages of cooking in this recipe, and, for a deep brown and ridiculous flavor, it\u2019s important to see it through all of them. It will be cooked through about halfway through roasting, but to transform it from pale and tender to crisp and golden brown, it must continue roasting at very high heat. Make sure to keep the smaller bits that fall away as you prepare and slice the cauliflower. They'll get the most golden and crunchy, almost like little cauliflower bread crumbs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/14/dining/14cauliflowerrex1-copy/14cauliflowerrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "cauliflower, cilantro, feta, garlic, parsley, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 390}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 140, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "220 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small head cauliflower", "6 garlic cloves, smashed", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving", "2 teaspoons fennel or cumin seed", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "1 ounce feta cheese, sliced or crumbled", "\u00bc cup parsley, tender leaves and stems, coarsely chopped", "\u00bc cup cilantro, mint or dill, tender leaves and stems, coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.\u00a0Slice cauliflower lengthwise into \u00bd-inch thick slices, including the core and leaves.
