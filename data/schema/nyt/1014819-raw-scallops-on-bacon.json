Any time you cook with a limited ingredient list, you want to select good-quality items, especially when working with raw seafood. Many store-bought scallops are soaked in a phosphate solution that plumps them up with water (and increases the price), so it\u2019s important to look for scallops that are labeled \u201cdry\u201d or \u201cdry-packed,\u201d since a phosphate-marinated scallop can taste soapy. Since the scallops are served over bacon, season them frugally with just a hint of salt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/09/dining/Raw-Scallops-on-Bacon/Raw-Scallops-on-Bacon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "16 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, finger foods, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, bacon, scallops", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 139, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "290 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 slices good-quality bacon", "4 large scallops", "1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "Salt and pepper (a mix of pepper is nice)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the bacon until fully cooked but not completely crisp; drain on paper towels.
