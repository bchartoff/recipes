{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken With Mushrooms and Caramelized Onions", "description": "This comforting one-pot dinner is reminiscent of a rich French onion soup, but made in less time and with lighter ingredients. Cooking the onions in a hot, dry pan forces them to release their moisture, so that they shrink and become silky and sweet in 30 minutes. Serve everything directly from the pan, with some crusty bread to soak up all the juices, or shred the chicken and pile it on top of buttered noodles. For something green, stir in some spinach to wilt at the end or serve alongside a simple green salad or roasted broccoli.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/30/dining/yf-chicken-with-mushrooms-and-onions/merlin_185308269_36ffc313-cc76-49cf-b406-3e6e20a4d34f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, cremini, sherry vinegar, skillet, yellow onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 4736}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons olive oil", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar", "2 teaspoons honey", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 3-inch pieces", "2 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced (about 4 cups)", "3/4 pound cremini mushrooms, stems removed and thinly sliced (about 4 cups)", "1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley or dill leaves and fine stems, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino (optional)", "Bread or cooked pasta, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons oil, 2 tablespoons vinegar, the honey, mustard, red-pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon salt; whisk until smooth.
