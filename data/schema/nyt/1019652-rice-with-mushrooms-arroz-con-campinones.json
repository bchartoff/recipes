{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice With Mushrooms (Arroz con Campinones)", "description": "This recipe \u2014 adapted from \u201cThe New Spanish: Bites, Feasts and Drinks\u201d by Jonah Miller and Nate Adler, the owners of Huertas in the East Village in New York \u2014 offers the cook a simple primer on paella. The method is a template best made in a paella pan and, as a bonus, it will free the cook from the notion that paella must be some kind of production number involving a budget-busting and time-consuming load of chicken, pork, seafood, vegetables and the like. This version features mushrooms and not much else. But its largely unadorned canvas will accept embellishments. Some tomato pur\u00e9e in the broth perhaps? Certainly. Seared sea scallops, shrimp, some sausage, pieces of duck confit, chickpeas, grilled peppers, eggplant chunks or baby artichokes? Those, too, but definitely not all at once.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/17/dining/17Pairingrex1/merlin_145120464_22490d49-7e61-4ddd-817c-ffd83ba9d4d0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "mushroom, rice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 471, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1134 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups mushroom or vegetable stock", "1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, brushed clean, stems removed and reserved, caps chopped in 1/2-inch pieces, preferably by hand", "Salt", "2 cloves garlic", "1/3 cup mayonnaise, store-bought or homemade", "2 teaspoons lemon juice", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup finely chopped onion", "1 cup finely chopped fennel bulb", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "1 cup Spanish short-grain rice (Bomba or Calasparra), or Arborio rice", "1/2 cup dry sherry or white wine", "1/2 cup jarred pickled mushrooms or 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon minced chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the stock in a small saucepan, add the mushroom stems and bring to a simmer.
