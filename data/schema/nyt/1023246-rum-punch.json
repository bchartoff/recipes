Two sweet. Three strong. Four weak. A dash of bitters. A sprinkle of spice. Served well chilled, with plenty of ice. An easy-drinking cocktail, this punch gets its deep notes from punchy lime and woodsy-sweet nutmeg. Like many spirits of yesteryear, Caribbean rum tells a greater story \u2014 of colonialism and sugar plantation slavery, as well as the enterprise of the West Indian people. In this big-batch recipe, the complex flavors bloom into a bright, expressive libation that truly goes the distance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brigid Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/24/dining/brw-Rum-Punch/merlin_207907986_1f56d6e2-6a90-435d-ad0d-fba4a42cd889-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "lime, nutmeg, rum, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 157}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups light or dark brown sugar", "16 limes\u00a0", "2 1/2 cups good dark Caribbean rum (such as Ten to One)", "4 teaspoons Angostura bitters\u00a0", "2 teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg (from about 1 whole nutmeg seed), plus more for garnish\u00a0", "3 cups ice, plus more for serving", "Lime slices, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make a brown sugar simple syrup: Add the brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups water to a small saucepan.
