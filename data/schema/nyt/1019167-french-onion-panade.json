{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "French Onion Panade", "description": "Panade is the French country cook's answer to stuffing \u2014 a satisfying and efficient way to use up stale bread.\u00a0Because there are so few components, taking care to ensure that each one is just right will make all the difference in how the final dish tastes.\u00a0Start with a stale, crusty loaf of sourdough bread. Cook the onions slowly, until they're a deep caramel color, and then season them properly with vinegar and wine. Buy good Gruy\u00e8re and Parmesan, and grate it yourself. And finally, use either homemade chicken stock, or buy some from a butcher. The result will be triumph of upcycling: basically French onion soup without the soup \u2014 just bite after bite of cheesy, onion-and-stock-soaked bread. Serve it as a main course, with a light green salad and a dry white wine or an ice-cold beer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/04/magazine/04mag-eat1/04mag-04eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "chicken stock, gruy\u00e8re, onion, parmesan, sourdough, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 441}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 611, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1044 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large, stale loaf crusty sourdough bread (about 1 1/4 pounds), cut into 1/3-inch slices", "8 tablespoons (4 ounces) unsalted butter, divided", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 pounds (about 5 large) yellow onions, thinly sliced", "Fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar", "1/4 cup white wine or dry vermouth", "5 to 6 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade", "12 ounces Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated (about 3 cups)", "3 ounces Parmesan, finely grated (about 1 1/3 cups)", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Divide bread slices among 2 or 3 baking sheets.
