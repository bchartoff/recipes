{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Purple Hull Peas and Mustard Greens in Smoky Potlikker", "description": "Southern field peas come in seemingly endless varieties, the most well known of which are black-eyed peas. For this dish, it\u2019s worth seeking out their sister, the pink-eyed purple hull pea that April McGreger, who makes Farmer\u2019s Daughter brand pickles and preserves Hillsborough, N.C., knew growing up. They are sold fresh in late spring through the early fall in the South, but can be found frozen. Black-eyed peas will do just fine, though. This is a bold and brothy soup with plenty of what Southerners call potlikker, flavored with ham hocks for traditionalists or smoked turkey parts for a lighter version. It is essential to serve this dish with sturdy cornbread to soak up the potlikker. Ms. McGreger likes thin and crispy cornbread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/30/dining/1230jpPEAS2/1230jpPEAS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings, about 12 cups", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "field peas, ham hock, mustard greens, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 59}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 134, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "367 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons oil", "1 1/2 cups finely diced yellow onion", "1 cup finely diced celery (leaves reserved)", "1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic", "1 hot red chile, cut in half lengthwise", "2 bay leaves", "3 small sprigs of thyme", "1 pinch of allspice", "2 small smoked ham hocks (about 2 pounds) or 3 pounds of smoked turkey wings or a smoked turkey leg", "1 1/2 pounds fresh or frozen purple hull or other field peas, or substitute 1 1/4 cup dried black-eyed peas (if using dry peas, soak in water for 6 hours or overnight and drain)", "1 large bunch of mustard greens, or about 12 cups torn leaves, lightly packed to total about a pound", "1 cup chopped tomato", "2 tablespoons pepper vinegar, apple cider vinegar or a combination of the two", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions (white and green parts)", "2 tablespoons torn celery leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Over medium heat, warm the oil in a large Dutch oven or other soup pot.
