It\u2019s incredibly easy to make at home. I roast the eggplant first, then brush it with the glaze and run it under the broiler. The trick is getting the timing right so the glaze caramelizes but doesn\u2019t burn. That\u2019s a guessing game in my old Wedgewood oven, because the broiler door has no window.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/14/science/16recipehealth/16recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 as an appetizer or side dish", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, eggplant, miso", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 406}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 117, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "684 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 long Japanese eggplants or 4 small Italian eggplants (about 3/4 pound)\n", "Salt to taste\n", "1 teaspoon sesame oil, plus additional for the baking sheet\n", "1 tablespoon mirin\n", "1 tablespoon sake\n", "2 tablespoons white or yellow miso\n", "1 tablespoon sugar\n"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise and cut off the stem and calyx.
