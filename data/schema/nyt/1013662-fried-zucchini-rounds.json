For this recipe, I got the crunchiest results from a classic flour/egg/bread-crumb method. Dip the food in flour, then in egg, then in bread crumbs. If you do it once with the zucchini slices, you get a deeply craggy, golden shell surrounding a tender vegetable chip. Dip it twice and it\u2019s twice as good.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, vegetarian, zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 6}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 335, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "307 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 small zucchini, trimmed and sliced into 1/2-thick rounds", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Vegetable oil, for frying", "1 cup flour", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 cup plain dried bread crumbs", "Black pepper, to taste", "Lemon wedges, for serving optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the zucchini into a colander in the sink, and lightly sprinkle with salt, tossing to coat.
