{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Coconut Curry Soup With Sweet Potato and Kale", "description": "This creamy, sweet-spicy-coconutty soup is all about balance: When the contrasting flavors are in harmony, it is outrageously delicious. (It is also vegan if there's no fish or shrimp in your curry paste.) Supermarket curry pastes are a great shortcut to flavor for weeknights, but salt and spice levels can vary greatly among brands. So taste at the end, and adjust: You may need to add curry paste, sugar or lime juice to your liking. Chile-lime flavored peanuts, available at some grocery stores, are particularly good for topping \u2014 snap them up if you happen to see them. Otherwise, roasted salted peanuts will work beautifully.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/30/dining/tk-butternut-squash-soup-with-brown-butter/tk-butternut-squash-soup-with-brown-butter-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "coconut milk, peanut butter, red curry paste, spinach, sweet potato, fall, winter, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1082}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 654, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "396 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1- to 2-inch chunks", "1 medium yellow or red onion, chopped", "5 large garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons coconut oil, preferably unrefined virgin", "2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 (4-ounce) jar red curry paste (1/2 cup)", "1 (13-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "1 cup smooth peanut butter", "Juice of 1 lime, plus more to taste", "5 ounces/1 medium bunch baby kale or spinach, stemmed and chopped", "Roasted, salted peanuts, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the sweet potatoes, onion, garlic, oil, sugar, turmeric and salt in a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker.
