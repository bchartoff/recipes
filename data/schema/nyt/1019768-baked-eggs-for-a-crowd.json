There\u2019s no\u00a0finer way to enjoy an egg. To pull this off for a crowd, a large casserole dish coated with butter and\u00a0partly filled with heavy cream\u00a0acts as a bath in which to gently cook the eggs. To dress them up, add smoked salmon, a handful of kale or spinach leaves, thinly sliced ham, halved cherry tomatoes or sliced, cooked mushrooms to the mix before you crack in the eggs. Really anything goes here, but keep the accoutrements light and let the eggs take center stage. Finish with flaky sea salt (those large crystals melt on your tongue in just the right way) and any\u00a0fresh\u00a0herb you love.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/16/dining/sc-baked-eggs/sc-baked-eggs-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, weekday, casseroles", "keywords": "eggs, heavy cream, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 274}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 543, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "556 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons butter, cut into small cubes, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 1/2 cups heavy cream or half-and-half", "12 to 16 eggs (depending on your crowd)", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (optional)", "Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/3 cup chopped mixed herbs, such as mint, parsley, dill, basil and chives", "16 pieces of toast or 8 English muffins, halved and toasted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 500 degrees.
