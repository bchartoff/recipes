{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom Soup", "description": "If the word \u201cmushroom\u201d conjures for you white buttons in little supermarket tubs, you\u2019re not alone. But there is a big world of mushrooms out there, and you don\u2019t have to be a forager to live in it. Wild mushrooms can be found in spring, summer and fall, but farmed mushrooms, grown mostly in the dark, are always around and a little easier to find than the ones hiding in the woods. So are dried mushrooms, which may be domesticated or truly wild and which are among the most flavorful ingredients you can keep in your pantry. This lovely soup is made with a combination of dried and fresh. It's delightfully simple \u2013 it comes together in about a half hour \u2013 which allows the complex flavors of the mushrooms to really shine through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/18/dining/18COOKING-MUSHROOM-SOUP/18COOKING-MUSHROOM-SOUP-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken stock, madeira, mushroom", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 717}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 246, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "657 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 ounces dried mushrooms (like cremini, morel; whatever you like)", "1/2 stick butter", "1 sprig fresh thyme or rosemary", "1 large yellow onion or 3 or 4 shallots, chopped", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 pound fresh mushrooms like shiitake or button, sliced (a variety is nice)", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/3 cup sherry or Madeira", "5 cups chicken stock, mushroom-soaking liquid or a combination", "1 cup cream (optional)", "Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the dried mushrooms in 5 cups\nvery hot water until soft, anywhere from\n5 to 15 minutes.
