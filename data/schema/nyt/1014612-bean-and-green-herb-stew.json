{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bean and Green Herb Stew", "description": "This is inspired by a famous Persian stew that is traditionally made with chicken and kidney beans. I came across a vegetarian rendition of the stew in Louisa Shafia\u2019s wonderful new book, \u201cThe New Persian Kitchen.\u201d Louisa uses tofu in her stew; I\u2019m just focusing on the beans, herbs and spinach.<br/><br/>It\u2019s crucial to cook red kidney beans thoroughly, because they contain a naturally occurring toxin called phytohemagglutinin that causes extreme intestinal distress but is reduced to harmless levels when the beans are boiled for a sufficient amount of time (10 minutes is sufficient, according to the Food and Drug Administration, but of course beans require a lot more cooking than that to soften). You should not cook them in a crockpot because the temperature may not be high enough to destroy the toxin, and you should discard the soaking water.<br/><br/>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/19/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, dried limes, red beans, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 64}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 246, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "13 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "742 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup red kidney beans (either the small or the larger, more elongated variety), soaked for 4 hours or longer in 1 quart water", "1 bay leaf", "2 large onions, 1 cut in half, the other thinly sliced", "Salt to taste", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or grapeseed oil, plus additional olive oil for drizzling", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 generous bunch spinach (about 3/4 pound), stemmed, washed thoroughly and coarsely chopped, or 2 6-ounce bags baby spinach", "1 cup tightly packed, coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1 cup tightly packed, coarsely chopped cilantro", "1 cup thinly sliced scallions (2 bunches)", "2 dried limes (available in Persian markets), soaked in hot water to cover for 15 minutes (optional) (place a small plate over the limes to keep them submerged)", "Freshly ground pepper", "Fresh lemon juice for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain the kidney beans and rinse.
