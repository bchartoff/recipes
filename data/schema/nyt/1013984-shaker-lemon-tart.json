It is said that Shaker cooks waste nothing, and if that is true, this tart is a perfect example of that ethos. The entire lemon (minus the seeds) is used \u2013 sliced thinly and macerated with plenty of sugar overnight \u2013 then baked with eggs and melted butter in a soft, flaky pastry. The end result is delicately-flavored and bright without the lip-puckering quality of most lemon desserts.\n\n(This recipe calls for Meyer lemons, which are milder than standard lemons, but the traditional variety will do \u2013\u00a0the thinner-skinned the better.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Christine Muhlke"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/17/dining/17COOKING-SHAKERLEMONTART2/17COOKING-SHAKERLEMONTART2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, eggs, meyer lemon, dessert, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 495, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "194 milligrams", "sugarContent": "36 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 lemons, preferably Meyer", "1 3/4 cups sugar", "3 eggs", "3 tablespoons pastry or all-purpose flour", "6 tablespoons salted butter, melted", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "3/4 teaspoon sugar", "15 tablespoons unsalted butter (almost 2 sticks), very cold and cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "1/2 cup ice-cold water", "1 tablespoons milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before serving, prepare the filling.
