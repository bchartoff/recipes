Bake it according to the recipe, which includes pastry bolstered with ground almonds and a filling rich with apricots that suggests frangipane with more almonds and mascarpone. But as the season takes on summer\u2019s glow, you could use this recipe as a template and swap out the apricots for a layer of lightly sweetened fresh raspberries splashed with framboise eau de vie. Diced poached sweetened rhubarb, diced fresh apricots or quartered and stemmed fresh black figs would work, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/12/dining/almond-apricot-tart/almond-apricot-tart-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "almond, apricot, tart pastry, dessert, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 103}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 505, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "271 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["30 dried apricots, about 9 ounces", "2/3 cup whisky", "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced", "2 whole eggs", "1 egg yolk", "3/4 cup sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 cup mascarpone", "1 teaspoon almond extract", "3 tablespoons sliced almonds", "3/4 cup ground almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place apricots and whisky in a saucepan, bring to a simmer and set aside.
