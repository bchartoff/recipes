{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hanky Panky", "description": "This sweet 50/50 martini was created in the early 1900s by Ada Coleman, the head bartender at the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London. It combines equal parts gin and sweet vermouth, finished with a splash of the bittersweet Italian amaro Fernet-Branca. Stick with the original recipe and use Fernet-Branca, or substitute another fernet. The amount you deploy depends on both individual taste and the intensity of the fernet used, so add it slowly, and as you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/30/dining/24cocktailsrex3/merlin_189797556_0f670e7b-d480-4d1a-8867-46c1b628a938-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "fernet branca, gin, spirits, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 142}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice", "1 1/2 ounces gin", "1 1/2 ounces sweet vermouth", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon fernet, such as Fernet-Branca, Contratto Fernet or Faccia Brutto Fernet Pianta", "1 (2-inch-long) piece of orange peel, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a coupe or Nick and Nora glass in the freezer to chill for at least 15 minutes and up to an hour.
