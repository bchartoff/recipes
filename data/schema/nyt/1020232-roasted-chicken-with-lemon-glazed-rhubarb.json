{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Chicken With Lemon-Glazed Rhubarb", "description": "A tangy rhubarb-lemon glaze gives roasted chicken a touch of sweetness and a deeply golden, crunchy skin. The rhubarb, which is cooked in the oven along with the chicken (but in a separate pan), becomes syrupy and soft, scented with thyme, coriander and fresh ginger. Some of the rhubarb mixture is brushed over the bird to help bronze its skin, while the rest makes a chutney-like condiment to serve alongside. If you have thin-skinned, mildly sweet Meyer lemons, you can skip the blanching in Step 3 and add the slices straight from the rhubarb pan. Regular lemons, especially those with a lot of the bitter white pith, really benefit from a brief blanch. This dish is wonderful over polenta or rice, which can absorb both chicken and rhubarb juices. Add a simple green salad (spinach is especially nice here), and dinner is done.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/dining/17apperex/17apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, rhubarb, thyme, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 162}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "3/4 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 large garlic clove, grated or minced", "1 (3 1/2- to 4 1/2-pound) chicken, patted dry", "3 thyme sprigs, plus more for garnish", "1 medium red onion, halved and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "Kosher salt, as needed", "1/2 lemon", "1 pound rhubarb, sliced crosswise 1/2-inch thick", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1 (2-inch) piece of fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds", "3 thyme sprigs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine salt, ground coriander, lemon zest, ginger, pepper and garlic.
