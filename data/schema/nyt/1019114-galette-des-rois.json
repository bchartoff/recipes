The pastry circles can be cut, covered and refrigerated ahead of time as can the almond filling (it will keep for up to 3 days).\u00a0And the whole construction can be made early in the day and baked when you\u2019re ready for it.\u00a0Tuck a bean or whole almond into the filling \u2014 warn your guests! \u2014 and, if there are children in the house, put them to work crafting a crown.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/24/magazine/24mag-ondessert1/24mag-24ondessert-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 8", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "pastries", "keywords": "almond flour, puff-pastry dough, unsalted butter, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 456}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 864, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "385 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3/4 cup (85 grams) confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 cup (85 grams) almond flour", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon rum (optional)", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "2 9 1/2-inch-diameter circles puff-pastry dough (from a 14- to 17-ounce package; 396-482 grams), cold", "1 whole almond or dried bean, for the charm"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "To make the filling:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Working with a mixer or by hand, beat the butter and sugar together until creamy and light.
