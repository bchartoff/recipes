If you want to make it fancy for guests, try this recipe. I like to amaze them and cut the bread lengthwise into 1/2-inch slabs rather than across. Creative cutting will take you a long way in this world. A word about the cheese: Make sure you press the feta or it\u2019ll have too much liquid in it to set up properly. If you\u2019re really strapped for time, you can substitute fresh ricotta for the feta, but it\u2019s not going to make your tomatoes pop quite as much.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Cohen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/10/dining/10JPTOMATOES/10JPTOMATOES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "5 to 6 large toasts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, arugula, bread, feta, grapefruit, heavy cream, tomato, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 71}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 378, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "746 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces feta cheese", "6 tablespoons heavy cream", "1 loaf of your favorite bread (about 1 pound)", "Zest of 1 grapefruit, plus 1 tablespoon grapefruit juice", "1/2 tablespoon tomato oil, from roasted tomatoes (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017942-roasted-winter-tomatoes\">see recipe</a>)", "1 garlic clove, finely chopped", "2 cups wild arugula or torn chicory", "1/2 cup torn parsley or mint", "4 cups roasted tomatoes, roughly chopped if large (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017942-roasted-winter-tomatoes\">see recipe</a>)", "Salt and pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Press the feta for an hour: Take a stack of plates, wrap the feta in a dish towel, put it on the bottom plate, and put the rest of the stack on top of it."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pur\u00e9e the pressed feta in a food processor until smooth.
