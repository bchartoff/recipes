{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Cucumber With Tofu", "description": "This vegan take on the cucumber and pork stir-fry offers the perfect level of acid to balance out the spice. Cooked quickly over high heat, cucumbers become juicy, with a lovely silky texture that is still crisp to the bite. Salting the cucumbers before stir-frying is essential, as it draws out moisture and allows for more of the garlicky umami flavors of the sauce to be soaked up. The tofu delivers heartiness, while the hint of Sichuan chile flakes takes this dish to another level.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/25/dining/hm-cucumber-and-tofu-stir-fry/hm-cucumber-and-tofu-stir-fry-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "cucumber, sesame oil, soy sauce, tofu, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 803}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large cucumbers (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled in alternating vertical stripes, seeded, then cut on the bias 1/4-inch thick", "Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, crumbled", "1 garlic clove, finely chopped", "Finely chopped scallions, toasted white sesame seeds and steamed rice, for serving (optional)", "Freshly ground white pepper", "2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 teaspoon sesame oil", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon Sichuan chile flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place cucumbers in a bowl, add 1 teaspoon salt, and gently massage the pieces.
