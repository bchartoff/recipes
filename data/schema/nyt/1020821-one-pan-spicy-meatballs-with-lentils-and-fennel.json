{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pan Spicy Meatballs With Lentils and Fennel", "description": "In this one-pan meal, you get spicy meatballs, savory lentils and sweet fennel that are all perked up with vinegar and parsley. For the speediest meatballs, use uncased bulk Italian sausage, which comes fully seasoned. When cooked at high heat and partly submerged in the chicken stock, the meatballs brown on top and stay moist on the inside \u2014 and the lentils soak up the flavorful pork juices. The roasted fennel provides sweetness and echoes the fennel seed in the meatballs, but feel free to use another vegetable that cooks at the same rate, like thinly sliced carrots.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/21/dining/as-meatballs-and-lentils/as-meatballs-and-lentils-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, weeknight, meatballs", "keywords": "brown lentils, fennel, italian sausage, rosemary, sausage, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 218}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 fennel bulb, cored, cut into 1/2-inch wedges through the root, plus 1/4 cup fresh fennel fronds", "2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds bulk hot Italian sausage (or fresh hot Italian sausages, casings removed)", "1 egg", "4 cups chicken stock", "2 cups brown lentils", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 fresh rosemary sprig", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar, white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar", "1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
