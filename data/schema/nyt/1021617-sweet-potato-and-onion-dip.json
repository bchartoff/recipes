{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato and Onion Dip", "description": "George Washington Carver, the botanist, educator and inventor, was known as \u201cthe peanut man,\u201d but he geeked out over sweet potatoes as much as peanuts. He recorded recipes for sweet potato flour, sweet potato starch and commercial canning. \u201cThe delicate flavor of a sweet potato is lost if it is not cooked properly,\u201d he wrote in his 1936 Bulletin No. 38. (His paper booklets were distributed to rural farmers to assist with crop rotation and provide instructions for added-value products.) Dr. Carver considered baking the best way to cook sweet potatoes while preserving the most flavor. Use varieties like Covington, Vardaman or jewel; the sugary notes balance the alliums and warming spices. Raw vegetables or tortilla chips make practical dipping utensils for this spread, or lather the dip over toasted thick-cut bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nicole Taylor"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/dining/17sweetpotatorex1/merlin_179866902_e91aebb1-72e5-4dd2-9970-e3cfa4564d60-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings (about 4 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, dips and spreads, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "fall, fennel, maple syrup, onion, parmesan, ricotta, sweet potato, kwanzaa, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 405}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds sweet potatoes\u00a0(about 3 medium)", "2 tablespoons grapeseed oil", "1/2 medium white onion, sliced (about 1 cup)", "1 small fennel bulb, sliced (about 1/3 cup), fronds reserved for garnish", "1/2 small jalape\u00f1o, finely chopped (about 2 teaspoons)", "1/3 cup fresh ricotta", "1/3 cup grated Parmesan (about 1 ounce)", "1/3 cup raw pecans, chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice (from 1/2 lime)", "2 teaspoons maple syrup", "1 1/2 teaspoons anchovy oil (optional)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/3 piece whole fresh nutmeg, grated (about 1 teaspoon)", "Extra-virgin olive oil and crispy fried onions (optional), for garnish", "Toasted <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020282-agege-bread\">Agege bread</a>, tortilla chips or celery sticks, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
