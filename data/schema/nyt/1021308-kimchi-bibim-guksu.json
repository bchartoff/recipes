{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi Bibim Guksu", "description": "Bibim guksu, which means \u201cmixed noodles\u201d in Korean, is an adaptable, spicy cold noodle dish that's perfect for a quick summer meal. For many Korean families, bibim guksu and samgyupsal, or grilled pork belly, is a go-to meal after long afternoons spent in the sun. Traditionally, bibim guksu does not include kimchi, but here it imparts a robust flavor with spicy and sour elements. Somyeon (thin wheat flour noodles) or soba noodles are traditionally used, but angel hair pasta would work as well. You can double the sauce and use it for bibimbap in another meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Darun Kwak"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/10/dining/dk-kimchi-bibim-guksu/merlin_175275615_38367b6f-3556-4166-813f-ba6e536d5547-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, noodles, pickles, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "carrot, cucumber, gochujang, kimchi, rice vinegar, seaweed", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 681}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup kimchi (about 3 1/2 ounces), chopped into 1/2-inch pieces, plus 1/4 cup kimchi juice", "3 tablespoons gochujang", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 teaspoon roasted white sesame seeds", "6 ounces somyeon (thin wheat flour noodles) or soba", "1 cup salad mix or leafy greens", "1/2 cup julienned cucumber", "1/4 cup julienned carrot", "Perilla leaves, chopped (optional)", "Gim (roasted seaweed sheets), crumbled or crushed (optional)", "2 soft-boiled or hard-boiled eggs, halved and served chilled, warm or at room temperature, depending on your preference  (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a pot of water to boil.
