{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Tomato, Mozzarella and Pesto Calzones", "description": "The secret to crispy calzones: Bake them in a very hot oven, and use drier ingredients in the filling to prevent the dough from becoming soggy. Slow-roasting the tomatoes for the filling concentrates their flavor and pulls out their juices, while pesto adds punch without contributing too much moisture. Fresh mozzarella is just right for many things, but it\u2019s too wet for a calzone, so use drier whole-milk mozzarella instead. If you prefer to use store-bought pizza dough, you\u2019ll need three (8-ounce) balls for this recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jessica Battilana"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/02/dining/02Handheld-Calzone-a/02Handheld-Calzone-a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, breads, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "flour, garlic, pesto, tomatoes, yeast, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 374}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 milliliters warm water", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "3 3/4 cups/480 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 pounds/905 grams small tomatoes, halved", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, slivered", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2653-basic-pesto\">basil pesto</a>", "1 pound/455 grams whole-milk mozzarella (not fresh mozzarella), shredded", "1 large egg, beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash", "Flaky salt, such as Maldon, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or in a large bowl with a wooden spoon), combine the water and sugar.

Let cool slightly, then use your fingers to pull the skins off each tomato. (Count the number of tomato pieces now, then you\u2019ll have an easier time dividing them among the 6 calzones.)

Divide into 6 pieces, each about 4 1/4 ounces/120 grams. Working with one piece of dough at a time, cup the dough ball on a work surface (almost as though you were forming a cage around the dough). Rotate your hand in clockwise circles, exerting a bit of pressure on the top of the dough ball, until it\u2019s a smooth sphere. Repeat with the remaining balls of dough and let stand 15 minutes, loosely covered with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel.

Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons pesto in the center of the dough and use the back of the spoon or an offset spatula to spread it in a thin, even layer, leaving a 1-inch border. Pile 2/3 cup mozzarella on half of the dough, then top with some of the tomatoes. Fold the dough in half, over filling, then roll and crimp the edge of the dough together to seal.
