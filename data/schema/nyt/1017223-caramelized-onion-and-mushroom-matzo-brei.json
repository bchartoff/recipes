There, the chef Glenn Harris offers a matzo brei two ways, but not, he will quickly tell you, because he likes it both ways. He only makes the savory kind, with deliciously glossy, nearly black, fried onions, as a concession to his partner in the restaurant, Jeff Lefcourt. Needless to say, Mr. Lefcourt's grandmother made hers savory.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "quick, one pot", "keywords": "egg, matzo, mushroom, onion, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 26}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 460, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "510 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/3 cup diced onions", "1/2 cup sliced mushrooms", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "2 matzos (about 2 ounces), broken into pieces", "5 large eggs, lightly beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a skillet over low heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter.
