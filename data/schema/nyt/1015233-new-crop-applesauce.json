{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "New Crop Applesauce", "description": "New-crop apples (that is, ones just picked) don\u2019t necessarily make it to supermarkets, where the general rule is to stock four or five dependable varieties that travel well. Those may come from eastern Washington or New Zealand or Peru. Not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with supermarket apples. They still have more or less the same health benefits and versatility in the kitchen. They just aren\u2019t going to make your heart beat faster.\n\nIf you long for the thrill of new-crop apples, head to a farmers\u2019 market, a farm stand or an honest-to-goodness apple tree on a cool day. What you will find is firm, dense fruit, some with the leaves still attached. When you take your first bite into the crisp flesh, the sweet juices fairly drip upon the tongue, not at all like the apples you recall. Smack your lips and swoon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/16/dining/16KITCH_SPAN/16KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, condiments", "keywords": "apple, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 143}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 242, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "53 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 firm apples, like Cortland or Macoun", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/2 small lemon, sliced 1/4- inch thick, seeds removed", "1 short piece cinnamon stick"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel and core apples, then cut into large chunks.
