{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlic Scape Pesto", "description": "The star of this pesto is the garlic plant\u2019s underappreciated second offering: the fleeting garlic scape. The ingredients are straightforward except for the substitution of sunflower seeds for pine nuts. The seeds are a fraction of the cost and do the job just as well. A food processor is a must for this recipe. For pesto, ingredient order matters. Start with the scapes and process for about 30 seconds. Add the seeds until they are broken down and mixed well with the scapes. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula for wandering bits. Next, pour in the olive oil. If you have Parmesan cheese in chunks, add it now, but if it is grated, wait until the scapes and seeds smooth out. If you\u2019re serving right away, add the basil and lemon juice. If not, hold back on the basil for now \u2014 otherwise the pesto will lose its vibrant color. Add generously to cooked spaghetti or spread on crusty bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Schwarz And Greg Kessler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/garlicpesto/garlicpesto-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3M", "recipeYield": "About 1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "basil, garlic, lemon juice, parmesan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 367}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 773, "unsaturatedFatContent": "49 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "219 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup garlic scapes, sliced crosswise (about 10 to 12 scapes)", "\u00bc cup raw sunflower seeds", "\u00bd cup extra virgin olive oil", "\u00bc cup Parmesan cheese", "\u00bd cup basil leaves", "Juice of one lemon", ""], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the garlic scapes in a food processor and pulse for 30 seconds."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the sunflower seeds and pulse for 30 seconds.
