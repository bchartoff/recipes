When I looked through it recently, there were a preponderance of lemon recipes, including one for roasted chicken with lemons and Coca-Cola from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Grasser-Herm\u00e9. Again, the savory and sweet. A food writer who has worked with chefs like Alain Ducasse, Grasser-Herm\u00e9 is also the wife of the Parisian pastry chef Pierre Herm\u00e9. It humored me that a French cook would deign to baste her chicken with Coke. But it makes perfect sense: like many drinks \u2013 wheat beer, iced tea, sangria, Vietnamese sugar-cane juice \u2013 Coca-Cola is always improved by a wedge of lemon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/03/dining/03COOKING-CHICKEN-COCACOLA/03COOKING-CHICKEN-COCACOLA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "coca-cola, coke, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 155}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 591, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1036 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Juice of 3 lemons, zest of 2 lemons", "One 4 1/2 pound chicken, butterflied", "3 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "Olive oil, for saut\u00e9eing", "1 medium onion, thickly sliced", "1/4 cup finely julienned ginger", "3 cloves garlic, crushed and chopped", "1 cup Coca-Cola", "1/2 teaspoon white vinegar", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, rimmed dish, sprinkle the lemon juice over both sides of the chicken.
