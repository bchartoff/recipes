{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carrot Maqluba", "description": "Maqluba is a traditional Palestinian dish made of rice, meat and fried vegetables, most often eggplants (in summer) or cauliflower (in winter), although some like to combine both, and add carrots as well. There are probably as many variations of this dish as there are families. A very popular, easy version is the one made with only carrots. Although maqluba is usually perceived as a time-consuming dish \u2014 you typically make broth, fry all the vegetables, assemble in layers and so on \u2014 this version uses a boneless, tender cut of meat, ready-made broth and a single pot. The whole dish is quick, and easy enough that you can make it on any weeknight in under an hour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Reem Kassis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/07/dining/05Nafasrex2/merlin_185308044_d86614f1-5f30-4124-9d83-85da702bbed9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, meat, one pot, steaks and chops, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "almond, carrot, cinnamon, jasmine rice, rib eye steak, rice, steak", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 296}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound jasmine or other long-grain rice (about 2 1/4 cups)", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "4 tablespoons olive oil or ghee (or a combination)", "1 pound boneless rib-eye steak, cut into bite-size cubes", "1 yellow onion, halved and sliced into 1/2-inch strips", "14 ounces carrots (about 4 medium-large), peeled and cut into 2 1/2-by-1/2-inch matchsticks", "4 cups good-quality store-bought or homemade chicken broth", "1/4 to 1/2 cup toasted or fried slivered almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the rice until the water runs clear.
