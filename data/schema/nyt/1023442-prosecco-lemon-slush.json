{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Prosecco Lemon Slush", "description": "Similar to the Italian cocktail sgroppino, which calls for a scoop of lemon sorbet, this recipe instead freezes Prosecco and Meyer lemon juice for a fresher taste and a cooling dessert. The slushy concoction makes a refreshing finish to a meal, and, topped with raspberries (and more Prosecco, if you wish), it looks festive, sort of like pink lemonade for grown-ups. Best of all, it stays fresh-tasting for several days, and never freezes completely solid.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/07/dining/02tanisrex3-slush/merlin_212255868_28361884-37b6-44f4-ae9c-747f33469a15-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, cocktails, dessert", "keywords": "lemon, make-ahead, prosecco, sugar, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 105}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup chilled Prosecco, plus more to finish", "1 cup Meyer (or other) lemon juice", "1 teaspoon grated Meyer (or other) lemon zest", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "Raspberries, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir together the Prosecco, lemon juice, lemon zest and sugar in a small, chilled stainless-steel mixing bowl until the sugar dissolves.
