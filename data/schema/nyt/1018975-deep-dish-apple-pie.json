{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Deep-Dish Apple Pie", "description": "If you\u2019re going to the trouble of making a pie, why not make it a blockbuster? This pie, adapted from the professional pie coach Kate McDermott, is both deeper and wider than the traditional nine-inch version. The thicker rim is especially satisfying, like a buttery, crumbly slab of shortbread. You can use a 10-inch deep-dish pie pan, or a deep nine- or 10-inch square, or another 2 1/2- to 3-quart baking dish of your choice. A mix of apple types always makes the best filling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/dining/02COOKING-DEEPDISH-APPLEPIE2/02COOKING-DEEPDISH-APPLEPIE2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "apple, calvados, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 303}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 406, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "294 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 3/4 cups/450 grams all-purpose flour, more for dusting surfaces", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "12 ounces/340 grams cold unsalted butter (3 sticks), cut into large dice", "About 10 cups/40 ounces/1200 grams peeled and sliced apples, more as needed (see note)", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "Pinch freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon allspice", "1 to 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice or 1 tablespoon unfiltered apple cider vinegar", "1 to 2 tablespoons Calvados or other apple liqueur, brandy or cider", "1/2 cup/70 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons/30 grams cold butter, cut into small pieces", "1 egg", "2 teaspoons coarse or granulated sugar for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In a food processor or stand mixer, mix together the flour, salt and sugar.
