{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Slow-Cooker Polenta With Sausages", "description": "The key to creamy polenta is a relatively high ratio of liquid to dried polenta: about five to one, instead of the more standard four to one. But the more liquid you use, the longer it will take the polenta to absorb it. That\u2019s why the best polenta is made in a slow cooker, where the dried corn can gently hydrate all day, with no stirring or worrying about clumps or molten splatters. In this recipe, the polenta is cooked with marinara (which is part of the liquid) and roasted red peppers. Then it\u2019s topped with quick-roasted sausages and sizzled capers and pepperoncini. If you are feeding spice-adverse kids, leave off the pepperoncini.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/19/dining/sd-Creamy-Slow-Cooker-Polenta-With-Sausages/merlin_200470158_d600b780-8084-4dd2-91e5-dbfa8bece803-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H5M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sausages, main course", "keywords": "capers, marinara sauce, polenta, pork sausage, porridge, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 168}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups dried polenta (not quick-cooking)", "1 (12-ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and chopped", "1 (32-ounce) jar good-quality marinara sauce", "5 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for the sausages", "Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh oregano or 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "Kosher salt", "6 raw hot or sweet Italian sausages (pork, turkey, chicken or vegan)", "1 (3.5-ounce) jar capers, drained", "1/3 cup drained, pickled sliced pepperoncini, banana peppers or cherry peppers", "3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together the polenta, roasted red peppers, marinara, garlic, olive oil, oregano, garlic powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker.
