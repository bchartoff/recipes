{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cornbread Dressing", "description": "This crisp, rich and buttery dressing is excellent as a side dish for dinner on Thanksgiving and as leftovers the next day. Aromatics and a mix of fresh and dried herbs give it a deep savoriness. The sausage brings a flavor of its own, but you can leave it out for a vegetarian-friendly alternative. The accompanying <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022722-cornbread\">cornbread recipe</a> yields a result firm enough to soak up the stock and buttermilk without it turning to a pudding, but you can also use store-bought cornbread or a boxed mix. If you do, just crumble the baked cornbread and spread it out on a sheet pan in an even layer to dry for at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours before mixing it with the rest of the dressing ingredients.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/10/dining/08sharerex3-dressing/merlin_197232351_10d04a87-48b0-424f-b8a5-65c5bd41bd1e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "stuffing and dressing, side dish", "keywords": "celery, cornbread, stock, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 603}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola, plus more if needed", "1 pound loose pork sausage", "1 large yellow onion, very finely chopped (2 cups)", "4 celery ribs, very finely chopped (2 cups)", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage (from 10 large leaves)", "Salt and pepper", "1 recipe <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022722-cornbread\">cornbread for dressing</a>, broken into 1-inch pieces, or 10 cups loosely packed cornbread", "1 1/2 cups chicken, turkey or vegetable stock", "1 cup buttermilk, preferably full-fat"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
