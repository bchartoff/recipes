My intention was to make a pakora, a sort of kale fritter, but when I spooned my mixture into the hot oil it fell apart. What I got were irresistible, crispy, battered pieces of chopped kale. The spicy chips beat any kale chips I\u2019ve ever made in the oven. Serve as a side dish or as a snack; I can\u2019t imagine children not liking this.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/10/science/09recipehealthkale/09recipehealthkale-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 180, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "208 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups roughly chopped curly kale (about 1/2 bag or 1 small bunch, stemmed)", "1 bunch scallions chopped (about 1/3 cup)", "1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds", "1/2 teaspoon garam masala", "Salt to taste", "1 cup chickpea flour", "3 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more for sprinkling", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon cold sparkling water", "Canola oil or grapeseed oil for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl combine kale, scallions, spices and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In another bowl whisk together chickpea flour, cornstarch, salt and baking powder.
