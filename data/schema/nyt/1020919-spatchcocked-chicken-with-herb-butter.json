This one is slathered with herb butter, making it extra fragrant. (If you have any herb butter left over, freeze it, then use it on steaks or fish or roasted potatoes.) Pulling out a well-flavored compound butter is one of those cheffy moves that makes almost everything taste better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/11/dining/06appe-chicken/06appe-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "weekday, poultry", "keywords": "herbes de provence, parsley, rosemary, thyme, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick), at room temperature", "4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley leaves", "2 teaspoons minced mixed fresh herbs \u2014 any mix of mint, oregano and marjoram", "1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme leaves", "1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary leaves", "1 3/4 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon herbes de Provence", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) chicken, spatchcocked and dried with paper towels (see Note)", "Lemon wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, mash together the butter, garlic, parsley, mixed herbs, thyme, rosemary, salt, herbes de Provence, lemon zest, white pepper and black pepper.
