{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Cauliflower Soup With Harissa Tomatoes", "description": "Cauliflower is cooked twice for this plush vegan soup, which is both cozy and complex in flavor. First, it\u2019s roasted so its flavor deepens, simmered in broth until thoroughly and completely soft. When pur\u00e9ed, it gives the soup a rich, velvety texture and a savory, caramelized character that\u2019s zipped up with harissa-glazed roasted tomatoes. A note on harissa pastes: They vary a lot in their heat level. If yours is milder, use the full amount listed, but if you\u2019re working with a more fiery harissa, use less. And if you don\u2019t have harissa on hand, any other chile paste will work well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/12/dining/05Apperex/merlin_214343217_f0db99a2-ecfc-45ab-add6-a647b1e9c355-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course", "keywords": "cauliflower, harissa, plum tomato, soup, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 649}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large head cauliflower (about 3 pounds), trimmed and cut into 1-inch florets (about 12 cups)", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/4 teaspoons ground coriander", "7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 small bunch thyme (about 10 sprigs)", "1 pound plum tomatoes, halved, seeds scooped out", "2 to 4 tablespoons harissa paste", "3 large bunches scallions, whites and greens thinly sliced (about 2 1/2 cups)", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded (if desired) and coarsely chopped", "4 large garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "6 cups vegetable stock", "3/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more for optional garnish", "1 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine cauliflower, 1 teaspoon salt, a large pinch of black pepper, \u00be teaspoon ground coriander, 3 tablespoons oil and half the thyme sprigs, tossing everything until well coated.
