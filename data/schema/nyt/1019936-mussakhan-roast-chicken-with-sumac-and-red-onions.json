{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mussakhan (Roast Chicken With Sumac and Red Onions)", "description": "Among Palestinians, mussakhan is a beloved roast chicken dish, at once energetic and comforting. In this recipe, adapted from Yasmin Khan\u2019s \u201cZaitoun: Recipes From the Palestinian Kitchen,\u201d you\u2019ll rub chicken thighs and drumsticks with spices, painting the skin a sumac-stained fuchsia. Marinate the meat with red onion for a few hours before roasting them in the oven, where the onions caramelize and absorb the chicken\u2019s fragrant juices. It\u2019s an ideal dish to share, one torn apart with your hands and topped with fried pine nuts, parsley and a generous dusting of sumac. Ms. Khan serves the chicken on toasted naan or taboon bread, which soak up the juices, but it's equally appealing alongside a salad or over a bed of rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mayukh Sen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/dining/06khan-chickenrexsub/merlin_149765637_bcfd1a1f-30d3-49ea-bb4f-2b528375f22b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, naan, sumac", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 993}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 572, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "887 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and drumsticks", "1 large lemon, juiced (about 4 tablespoons)", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 1/2 tablespoons sumac, plus more for serving", "4 garlic cloves, crushed", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Sea salt and ground black pepper", "1 large red onion (about 1 pound), halved and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons pine nuts", "Naan or Arabic\u00a0taboon bread, for serving", "Coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slash the flesh of each piece of chicken diagonally a few times, around 3/4 inch apart, and then place the meat in a large bowl or plastic container.
