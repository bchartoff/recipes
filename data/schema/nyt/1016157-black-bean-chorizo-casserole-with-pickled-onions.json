{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Bean Chorizo Casserole with Pickled Onions", "description": "You\u2019ve probably made some kind of Mexican casserole layered with tortillas, beans, and plenty of melted cheese before (and if you haven\u2019t, now is the time). But this one is bolder, brighter and more deeply flavored, thanks to pasilla chiles in the sauce, lime zest in the luscious crema topping, and chorizo in the beans. If you\u2019d prefer a vegetarian version, leave out the chorizo. But do seek out the pasilla chiles (also called negra chiles), which add their inimitable smoky, fruity spice. This casserole reheats perfectly and will keep for at least five days in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/26/dining/26CASSEROLE1/26JPCASSEROLE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "black beans, chorizo, onion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 393}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 845, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "57 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "1333 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup Mexican crema, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream", "Zest of 1 lime and 1/4 cup fresh lime juice", "1 red onion, halved root to tip and thinly sliced into half moons", "2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "2 1/2 teaspoons sugar", "2 ounces dried pasilla (also called negro) chiles rinsed, seeded and stemmed (6 to 8 chiles)", "6 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 pound cured (cooked) chorizo, finely diced", "1 white onion, diced", "1 small bunch cilantro, leaves and stems separated", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "3 cups cooked or canned black beans, rinsed and drained", "4 cups chicken stock", "8 garlic cloves, unpeeled", "12 6-inch corn tortillas", "12 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, grated (3 cups)", "1/2 cup roasted pumpkin seeds (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the lime crema: In a small bowl, whisk together sour cream and lime zest.
