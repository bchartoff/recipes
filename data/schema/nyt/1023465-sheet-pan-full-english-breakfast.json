{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Full English Breakfast", "description": "There\u2019s always a night when you want to have breakfast for dinner, and this is how to do it British-style, in a very untraditional, sheet-pan take on the classic. Drizzled with Worcestershire sauce, the roasted mushroom and tomatoes become especially savory while the eggs are cooked until crisp-edged and runny-yolked, right in the sausage drippings. This recipe works best with pork sausages, which will release a flavorful slick of brawny fat. But other kinds of sausages \u2014 turkey, chicken, plant-based \u2014 will also work well. Serve this with plenty of buttered toast, and if you like, baked beans (most authentically, straight from a can).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/14/dining/09apperex1-breakfast/09apperex1-breakfast-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, easy, for two, weeknight, meat, main course", "keywords": "breakfast sausage, egg, plum tomato, sheet-pan, white mushrooms", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 445}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces white button or cremini mushrooms (4 cups), halved or quartered if large", "4 small plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, plus more for serving", "3 thyme sprigs", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "8 breakfast sausage links, either cooked or uncooked is fine, pricked all over with a fork", "4 large eggs", "Buttered toast, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
