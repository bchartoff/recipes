{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dumpling Noodle Soup", "description": "Keep a package or two of frozen dumplings in your freezer for this warming weeknight meal. This recipe is loosely inspired by wonton noodle soup, but replaces homemade wontons with store-bought frozen dumplings for a quick alternative. The soup base, which comes together in just 10 minutes, is surprisingly rich and full-bodied, thanks to the trio of ginger, garlic and turmeric. Miso paste brings extra savoriness, but you could substitute soy sauce or tamari. Scale up on veggies if you like; carrots, peas, snow peas or mushrooms would be excellent additions. Any type of frozen dumpling works in this dish, making it easy to adapt for vegan, vegetarian or meat-loving diners.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/26/dining/hm-dumpling-soup/merlin_200484192_3bc869e5-4058-4892-8c66-beaf77e2253c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "bok choy, broccoli, dumplings, soup, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2177}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "6 ounces thin dried wheat, egg or rice noodles", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger, grated", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and grated", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "6 cups vegetable stock", "2 tablespoon white miso paste", "16 ounces frozen dumplings (not thawed)", "4 baby bok choy (about 12 ounces), trimmed and each cut into 4 pieces through the stem", "1 small head broccoli (about 9 ounces), cut into bite-size florets", "Handful of cilantro or chopped scallions, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
