{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broiled Grapefruit With Brown Sugar and Flaky Salt", "description": "A classic at a fancy breakfast or brunch, the best broiled grapefruits have a glossy caramelized topping covering sections of the warm, juicy citrus. This recipe also includes a little cinnamon for a heady fragrance, and a touch of sea salt, which softens the bitterness of the grapefruit peel. It\u2019s best served warm from the oven, when the brown sugar is still melted and syrupy. Ruby or pink grapefruits make for the prettiest presentation, but white ones work just as well, and have a livelier, more acidic flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/25/dining/20apperex4/merlin_166104819_c747c82e-1716-4cc0-82a9-2674de4d391e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "grapefruit, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 78}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 grapefruits, preferably pink or ruby", "4 tablespoons light brown sugar", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "Honey, for drizzling", "Ground cinnamon (optional)", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Move the rack 4 inches away from the broiler, and turn it on."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Halve the grapefruits through their equators.
