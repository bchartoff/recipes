Joaqu\u00edn Sim\u00f3 of Pouring Ribbons, an East Village bar, uses a concentrated concoction made from two parts Demerara sugar to one part water, which add a compelling toffee-like taste and silky texture to the amber booze. Brown-sugar simple syrups are also wonderful in nonalcoholic drinks, particularly lemonade and ice tea, and they will last for months in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/24/dining/video-clark-syrup/video-clark-syrup-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cognac, cura\u00e7ao", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 23}, "recipeIngredient": ["125 grams (1/2 cup) Demerara sugar", "Orange slice, for garnish", "Granulated sugar, for rim", "2 ounces Cognac, preferably Pierre Ferrand 1840", "3/4 ounce dry Cura\u00e7ao, preferably Pierre Ferrand", "3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice", "1 dash orange bitters", "Orange twist"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small pot over low heat, simmer the Demerara sugar with 1/4 cup cold water.
