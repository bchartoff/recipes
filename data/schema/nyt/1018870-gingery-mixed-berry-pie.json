{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gingery Mixed Berry Pie", "description": "Mixed berry pie is the ultimate summertime treat: Handfuls of the season\u2019s finest blueberries, blackberries and raspberries are tucked into a crisp, buttery crust that\u2019s just begging to be served with a scoop of ice cream. Fresh ginger lends unexpected warmth and spice to this well-loved classic, but for a little punch, add up to 1 tablespoon of very finely minced candied ginger. If you find yourself short on one type of berry, make up the difference with another \u2014 just make sure the berries are the best you can find. For a crisp bottom crust, bake the pie in the lower third of your oven until it is deeply golden and the fruit juices are bubbling, and don\u2019t skip the lattice top. It\u2019s not just for looks: The vents help steam escape and the berry juices to concentrate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/21/dining/21COOKING-BERRY_PIE1/21COOKING-BERRY_PIE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H50M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "blackberries, blueberries, ginger, raspberries, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 133}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup/140 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "5 tablespoons/40 grams cornstarch", "2 teaspoons very finely grated, peeled fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon candied ginger, finely minced (optional)", "4 cups/592 grams blueberries", "2 cups/288 grams blackberries", "2 cups/246 grams raspberries", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "Pinch kosher salt", "1 egg for egg wash", "2 teaspoons turbinado sugar", "1/4 teaspoon flaky salt, like Maldon, not table salt", "A <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-all-butter-pie-crust\">double batch of all-butter pie crust,</a> refrigerated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the sugar and lemon zest.
