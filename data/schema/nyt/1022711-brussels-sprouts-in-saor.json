The saor, or sweet and sour topping, makes an ideal accompaniment to roasted brussels sprouts \u2014 served either hot or at room temperature \u2014 though it would work equally well on any vegetable side, be it green beans, cauliflower or broccoli. With lemon, vinegar and wine among its ingredients, this dish brings a welcome vividness to the Thanksgiving table \u2014 or any meal \u2014 where bright, acidic offerings are few and far between.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15Unboring2/merlin_197274678_7a1badeb-73e6-43b4-b75a-60a0ac47c188-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, golden raisins, white wine, thanksgiving, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 307}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup golden raisins", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "2 1/2 pounds trimmed, halved brussels sprouts (from about 3 pounds whole)", "10 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Fine sea salt", "2 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced", "Scant 1/4 teaspoon saffron", "1/3 cup pine nuts", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "Black pepper", "1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1/2 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
