{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheddar Chive Crisps", "description": "Every cookie tin deserves a little savory bite. These delicate crisps are speckled with fresh herbs and have a golden vein of cheese running through the dough. Fresh ground black pepper adds a gentle, lingering heat. You can go with any firm cheese that has strong notes here; sharp Cheddar, Parmesan or pecorino will all work nicely. Both the dough and cheese will benefit from staying cold while you work, so return the dough to the refrigerator as often as necessary to keep it chilled.

Fold the left side over the top like you are closing a book. Press down lightly on the dough to adhere the fold. Slice the dough lengthwise, down the middle. You should have 2 strips at this point.
