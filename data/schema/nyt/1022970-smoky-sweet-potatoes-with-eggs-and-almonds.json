{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Sweet Potatoes With Eggs and Almonds", "description": "Slow-roasting sweet potatoes in coconut oil and spices gives them a rich flavor and delicately crisp texture on their exterior while they turn velvety within. Don\u2019t be tempted to take them out of the oven early. As Steven D., a reader, wrote in the notes of the <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013488-coconut-oil-roasted-sweet-potatoes\">recipe upon which this one is based</a>: \u201cThe potatoes are soft after a half hour or so, but then the crusts harden in the second half hour, giving them the delicious texture that makes the dish unique.\u201d Adding fried eggs, a smoky yogurt sauce and crunchy almonds turns a sweet potato side dish into a satisfying, meatless meal. And if you don\u2019t have coconut oil on hand, you can use olive or another cooking oil, though the potatoes won\u2019t have the same texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/16/dining/11Apperex/merlin_201297825_b7742479-0e23-42fb-a8f2-c5d36aab7344-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "almond, eggs, sweet potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 597}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons coconut oil", "2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled or unpeeled, and cut into 1/2-inch chunks", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt, plus more as needed", "3/4 teaspoon <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021923-garam-masala\">garam masala</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021924-baharat-blend\">Baharat</a>, curry powder or another spice mix", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed", "3 to 5 thyme sprigs", "1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt", "1 small garlic clove, finely grated, passed through a press or minced", "Eggs, for frying, as many as you like", "1/2 cup chopped Marcona or salted, roasted almonds", "Soft herbs, such as parsley, mint or cilantro, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
