{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Perfect Pie Crust", "description": "This classic dough contains no special ingredients, just flour, salt, butter and water, but it works like a dream. The recipe makes a single crust for a 9-inch pie; simply double it to make a double-crust pie. (If you make it by hand, you can even triple or quadruple the recipe.) If you\u2019d prefer to use a food processor, you can, and it\u2019s a good idea if you have warm hands. To do so, pulse the butter into the flour mixture a few times, until the butter is the size of walnut halves or peas, then transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and proceed with adding the water. (Adding the water in the food processor often leads to hydration problems and overmixing, which is why you should do that part by hand no matter what.) The dough keeps in the refrigerator for up to 2 days and in the freezer for up to 3 months (thaw it overnight in the refrigerator before rolling it out).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/14/dining/14Perfect-pie-crust/14Perfect-pie-crust-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "1 single crust for a 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 400}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 \u00bc cup/160 grams all-purpose flour", "\u00bc teaspoon fine sea salt", "\u00bd cup/115 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "3 to 4 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt to combine.
