The next day I looked at a bottle of sesame soy ginger dressing at a local market and was horrified to see that the second listed ingredient was sugar. I thought: I can make something sort of sweet and do better than that. And so I did. This dressing is great with green salads and cooked vegetables, as well as with noodles and grains.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/02/09/science/09recipehealth/09recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "Makes 2/3 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday, condiments", "keywords": "ginger, sesame oil, healthy, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 151}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "55 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 garlic clove, finely minced or pur\u00e9ed", "1 teaspoon finely minced ginger", "3 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1 teaspoon brown sugar or agave nectar", "5 tablespoons canola oil or light sesame oil", "2 tablespoons sesame oil", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in a minichop or blender (because the amounts are small, I prefer a minichop) and blend until homogenized."}]}
