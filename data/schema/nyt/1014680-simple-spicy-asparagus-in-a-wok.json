That\u2019s fine for the first week or two of the season, but then it\u2019s time to dial up the interest factor and add some spice. Asparagus actually stands up quite well to aggressive flavors. A quick toss in a hot wok with garlic, ginger and chiles doesn\u2019t overwhelm it at all, at least if you don\u2019t overcook the spears. Instead, the vegetable\u2019s sweetness becomes accentuated by contrast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/07/dining/07spicyasparagus/07spicyasparagus-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "asparagus, chili, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 182}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 115, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "481 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds asparagus, medium- or pencil-size", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "6 small dried red peppers", "Salt and pepper", "1/2 teaspoon Chinese chile paste", "1 teaspoon grated garlic", "1 teaspoon grated ginger", "1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest", "1 jalape\u00f1o or serrano chile, finely chopped", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro", "3 green onions, slivered", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Snap off and discard bottoms of asparagus, then cut into 2-inch pieces (halve thicker pieces lengthwise first)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set wok over high heat and add vegetable oil.
