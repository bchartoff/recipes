{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banana Cream Pie No-Churn Ice Cream", "description": "This no-churn ice cream doesn\u2019t require any cooking or special equipment. All you have to do is mash up some bananas and whip some heavy cream. The whipped cream mimics the air that\u2019s incorporated into traditional ice cream when it\u2019s churning in an ice cream machine. For the strongest flavor, use really, really ripe bananas; mushy, bruised ones with black peels will work well. Large crumbles of vanilla wafers stirred into the ice cream and sprinkled on top add crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/15/dining/em-banana-ice-cream/merlin_156813429_6bf861a4-3027-443f-9742-cb26325d2ee4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "banana, condensed milk, heavy cream, vanilla, vanilla wafers, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound very ripe bananas (about 3 medium bananas), peeled", "1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "Pinch of ground cinnamon", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "2 1/2 cups/600 milliliters heavy cream", "25 vanilla wafer cookies (about 85 grams), broken into coarse pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, use a large fork or a potato masher to mash the bananas well.
