Now that we have so many bakeries producing good breads, I don\u2019t really need to bake as often, but I\u2019ve never gotten bread quite like this grainy loaf in a bakery. Make it on a weekend when you\u2019re at home for a while. There\u2019s only about 15 minutes of active work, but the bread requires several rises. Although I call it cracked wheat bread, I use bulgur, which makes a lighter, moister bread than cracked wheat.

Flour your hands and your work surface, and knead the dough for 10 minutes, adding flour as necessary, until the dough is elastic and springs back when you press it with your finger. It will be dense and slightly tacky. Shape the dough into a ball. Rinse and dry your bowl, and coat with oil. Place the dough in it, then flip it over so that it is coated with oil.
