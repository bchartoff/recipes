(Be sure to get corn flour, not pure white cornstarch.) These muffins have great corn flavor, and they have a very tender, creamy texture when hot and stay moist when cool. If you\u2019re using regular cornmeal, the muffins are still delicious, especially warm; just reduce the buttermilk to 2 cups.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Francis Lam"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/01/magazine/01cornmuffins/01cornmuffins-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "buttermilk, corn flour, lard, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 164, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "225 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons lard or butter, plus 2 tablespoons melted butter", "2 1/2 cups corn flour or extra-fine cornmeal (not cornstarch)", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon homemade baking powder (see note)", "2 1/2 cups buttermilk, room temperature", "1 egg, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400.
