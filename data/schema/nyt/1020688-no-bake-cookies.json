{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "No-Bake Cookies", "description": "These classic no-bake peanut butter and chocolate treats are also known as cow patties or preacher cookies. The story goes like this: If a housewife looked out the window and saw the preacher coming up the mountain on his horse, she could whip up a batch of these cookies in the amount of time it would take him to reach the front door. True or not, it\u2019s a good story \u2014 and a great cookie that\u2019s a cinch to put together. Combine all the ingredients in a pot over medium heat, then drop spoonfuls on a sheet pan and chill until set. Be sure to use quick-cooking oats, not instant, when making these cookies. The less-processed oats provide delightful texture and chewiness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/05/dining/ml-no-bake/merlin_165082842_fcfde09d-f764-4d12-b63d-3ec9e0a46e14-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "3 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "cocoa powder, oats, peanut butter, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 187}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/350 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick)", "1/3 cup/30 grams unsweetened cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 cups/280 grams quick-cooking oats", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters smooth or crunchy peanut butter (not natural)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line two large sheet pans with parchment paper.
