Its hidden sweetness shines when seared in plenty of oil and braised until glazed and soft. In this vegan pasta sauce, cabbage slumps as its juices release and mingle with red wine and caramelized tomato paste. To ensure the flavors aren\u2019t too diluted, use just a small amount of water and trust that the cabbage will release moisture as it cooks. Use this warming braise to sauce fat noodles, or eat it with polenta, mashed potatoes, beans, sausage or a fried egg. The cabbage can be cooked up to three days ahead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/23/dining/as-red-cabbage-ragu/merlin_201238704_79135a92-554d-40c1-809a-cdf74f9597c7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "healthy, vegetarian, pasta, red cabbage, tomato paste", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1237}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 medium red cabbage (1 1/2 to 2 pounds), cut through the core into 6 wedges", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 red or yellow onion, coarsely chopped", "5 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped", "4 1/2 ounces (1 tube) double concentrate tomato paste, or 6 ounces (1 can) tomato paste", "1/3 cup red wine", "3/4 cup coarsely chopped parsley (from 1 1/2 cups leaves and tender stems)", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1 pound tube pasta, like rigatoni or paccheri"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, heat 4 tablespoons oil over medium-high.
