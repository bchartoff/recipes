{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Sea Scallops With Ginger-Lime Butter", "description": "Day-boat scallops, the kind that are dry-packed (never frozen or dosed with preservatives), are what you want for this decadent but very simple dish. The scallops are seared on cast iron, but gradually, for a crisp, well-browned surface that intensifies their natural sweetness. Ginger, lime and hot pepper enhance the rich meatiness of all fresh seafood, and here especially so. A roasted sweet potato and a pile of blanched bok choy complete this quintessentially elegant, fast-food meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/10/dining/10KITCHEN1/10KITCHEN1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two", "keywords": "bok choy, sea scallop, sweet potato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 369}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 362, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "811 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 baby sweet potatoes (or use 2 larger sweet potatoes)", "4 to 6 large dry-packed fresh sea scallops, about 12 ounces", "Salt and pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon grated peeled ginger", "1 fresh hot red chile pepper, finely chopped", "Zest and juice of 1 lime", "Olive oil, for searing", "8 ounces baby bok choy, washed, leaves separated and stems discarded (or use spinach or chard\u00a0leaves)", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
