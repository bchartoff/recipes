{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Tantanmen With Pan-Fried Tofu", "description": "Tantanmen is the Japanese version of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021499-cafe-chinas-dan-dan-noodles\">dan dan noodles,</a> a Sichuan dish of noodles and pork bathed in a spicy sesame broth. Chinese or Japanese sesame pastes, which are made from roasted sesame seeds and yield a more robust flavor than tahini, are traditionally used in this dish. (But tahini works too; it will produce a mellower, creamier result.) For those who keep doubanjiang, or Chinese fermented bean paste, on hand, add a teaspoon or two to your soup base for even deeper flavor. Slices of pan-fried tofu make this dish feel more substantial, but if you are looking for a shortcut, crumble it up and pan-fry it alongside the mushrooms. For non-vegans, add a jammy egg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/21/dining/19Tantanmenrex/19Tantanmenrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "corn, extra-firm tofu, ramen noodle, sesame paste, shiitake, tahini, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2394}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "12 ounces dried ramen noodles", "3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 (12-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and sliced crosswise, 1/4-inch thick", "8 large shiitake mushrooms (about 8 ounces), trimmed and thinly sliced", "4 cups vegetable stock", "1 (5-by-6-inch) piece dried kombu (about 1/2 ounce), optional", "2 cups soy or oat milk, at room temperature", "1/2 cup Chinese or Japanese sesame paste, or use tahini", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "2 tablespoons sesame oil", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons chile oil, plus more for serving", "1 cup frozen corn, defrosted and drained, if needed", "4 scallions, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon roasted sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.
