{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlic Knots", "description": "Garlic knots are a beloved classic pizzeria snack that can easily be recreated at home. Start with premade dough from the supermarket or buy it straight from your neighborhood pizza joint. For best results, the dough needs to rest \u2014 or \u201crise\u201d \u2014 twice. The first resting period achieves a dough that is pliable and easy to roll out and shape. Once formed into knots, the dough rests a second time, allowing it to relax after being stretched and shaped, resulting in a more tender and fluffier garlic knot. But it\u2019s the garlic butter that\u2019s the star here. Cook the garlic slow and low, since frying it too fast will make it bitter, then toss it with the knots. For a cheesy twist, sprinkle some grated Parmesan over the glossy rolls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/dining/kc-garlic-knots/kc-garlic-knots-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, garlic, marinara sauce, parmesan, parsley, pizza dough", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 57}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound prepared pizza dough, thawed if frozen", "All-purpose flour, for dusting", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley", "Kosher salt", "Parmesan, for finishing (optional)", "Warmed marinara sauce, for dipping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Divide dough into 2 equal pieces and arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet a few inches apart.
