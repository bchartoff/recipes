What remained was a drink as fresh as a breeze on a calm summer sea.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/23/dining/video-summer-drinks-cantina/video-summer-drinks-cantina-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "fernet branca, gin, lime juice, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 9}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces Fernet Branca", "1/2 ounce gin", "1 ounce fresh lime juice", "3/4 ounce simple syrup", "3 slices cucumber", "Ginger beer", "Cucumber slice, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine 1 1/2 ounces Fernet Branca, 1/2 ounce gin, 1 ounce fresh lime juice, 3/4 ounce simple syrup and 3 slices cucumber in an ice-filled cocktail shaker.
