Choux pastry dough is unique in that it is typically prepared in a saucepan over heat, which might sound intimidating, but it is much more approachable than you might think. If you don\u2019t have a pastry bag, you can use a resealable plastic bag to pipe these \u00e9clairs \u2014 or turn them into cream puffs by simply dropping the dough in 2-tablespoon scoops about 3 inches apart onto a baking sheet. The pastry starts to soften as soon as the \u00e9clair is filled with custard, so indulge immediately. It won\u2019t be difficult. Save any leftover chocolate glaze in the refrigerator. Reheated, it makes perfect hot fudge sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/dining/ss-chocolate-eclairs/merlin_149986377_d2b757e6-c28c-43f3-ba35-7790c68bdae2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 \u00e9clairs", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastries", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, butter, corn syrup, egg, heavy cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 83}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 279, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "165 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams cornstarch", "Pinch kosher salt", "2 cups/480 milliliters whole milk", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters heavy cream", "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeds scraped out and reserved", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick)", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/95 grams all-purpose flour", "3 large eggs", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/170 grams chopped bittersweet chocolate", "1 tablespoon corn syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the custard: Stir together the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and kosher salt in a medium saucepan until smooth.
