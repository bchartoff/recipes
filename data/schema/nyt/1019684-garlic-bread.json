This is a versatile recipe, as readily made with thin baguettes, as it is with rustic sourdoughs and airy Italian loaves. Cutting the bread like a Hasselback potato keeps the butter from seeping out and allows the garlic to infuse the bread with its flavor without scorching. But, if it's an extra cheesy garlic bread you're looking for, slip a little mozzarella into each slit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/11/dining/as-garlic-bread/as-garlic-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "1 loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, breads", "keywords": "bread, garlic, parmesan, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 271}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "4 fat garlic cloves, grated", "1/2 cup Parmesan, grated", "1/4 cup firmly packed chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "Black pepper", "1 baguette or rustic crusty loaf", "1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
