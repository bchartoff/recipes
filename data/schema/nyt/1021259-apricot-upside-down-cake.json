{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apricot Upside-Down Cake", "description": "Apricot halves, baked in a faux caramel of melted butter, brown sugar and spices, burst with punchy flavor in every bite of this cake. The sticky topping complements the almost-tart, fleshy stone fruit, and offers a textural contrast to the buttery cake. A hint of almond further accentuates the apricot flavor. This rustic beauty is perfect by itself, but you can serve it with whipped cream or ice cream, if you want to be fancy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/17/dining/vl-apricot-upside-down/merlin_174651687_3d20f343-d75d-4a28-a311-91217be86a92-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "apricot, brown sugar, flour, milk, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 253}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing", "Flour, for dusting", "1/2 cup/110 grams light or dark brown sugar, packed", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "8 medium apricots, rinsed and dried (about 1 pound)", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/55 grams almond flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2/3 cup/135 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
