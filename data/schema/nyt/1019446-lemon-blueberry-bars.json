{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon-Blueberry Bars", "description": "Fresh blueberries make these lemon bars a bit sweeter than usual, and very jammy, but without compromising their essential acidity. The grated lime zest gives the curd another note of citrus complexity. But if you\u2019d rather leave out the lime, use more lemon zest. Or try playing with orange and grapefruit zests. The filling stays pretty soft in these tender bars, so it\u2019s best to keep them in the fridge until right before serving, then dust with powdered sugar at the last minute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/dining/08Apperex1/merlin_141877458_fc6f8b62-290c-4f27-b634-c250283ab074-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "blueberries, lemon juice, lemon zest, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 525}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 258, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "67 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more for dusting", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "10 tablespoons/140 grams cold unsalted butter, cubed", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters fresh lemon juice (from 4 to 8 lemons)", "3 large egg yolks", "2 large eggs", "2 teaspoons cornstarch", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), diced", "1/2 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated lime zest (optional or substitute lemon zest)", "3/4 cup/80 grams fresh blueberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees and line a 9-inch square baking dish with parchment paper so it hangs over the edges on all sides by a few inches.
