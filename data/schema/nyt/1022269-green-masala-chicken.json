{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Masala Chicken", "description": "One of the first things I learned about Dr. Jyotsna Mhatre, my mother-in-law and a psychiatrist from Mumbai who moved to the United States in 1974, was that she is an astonishingly good cook. The first time I went to her house, she put out a giant platter of herbaceous lamb kebabs with chutneys for dipping. The platter was meant to be overgenerous and welcoming, but my cousin and I gobbled up every single bite. Dr. Mhatre, whom I call Aai (Marathi for mother), came up with this quick, saucy stir-fry inspired by the bright flavors of kharouni, a sour-spicy-sweet shrimp and unripe mango dish she grew up eating. Many Indian American home cooks use jarred ginger and garlic pastes because they\u2019re convenient, and they incorporate nicely for a smooth sauce. You can find them, as well the chutneys called for here, at any South Asian market, as well as online. Marinating tenderizes the chicken and rounds out the flavors, but it\u2019s entirely optional. Aai sometimes swaps in peeled shrimp for the chicken, and tofu or chickpeas work well as vegetarian options.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/26/dining/sdg-cilantro-chicken/merlin_188173056_f3b21760-23e5-4f38-b8d1-97b32149e11a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, chutney, cilantro", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 559}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces", "Heaping 1/3 cup coriander (cilantro) chutney", "1 1/2 tablespoons green chile chutney", "3 tablespoons store-bought garlic paste, or 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh garlic (from about 4 large cloves)", "1 1/2 tablespoons store-bought ginger paste, or 1 tablespoon finely minced fresh ginger (from about a 1-inch piece)", "2 tablespoons plain whole-milk or low-fat yogurt", "5 tablespoons canola or other neutral oil", "Kosher salt", "1 jumbo yellow or red onion, chopped into roughly 1-inch chunks", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Cooked rice, whole grains or chapati, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, stir together the chicken, chutneys, garlic and ginger pastes, and yogurt.
