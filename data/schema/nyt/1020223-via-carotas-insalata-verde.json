{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Via Carota\u2019s Insalata Verde", "description": "At Via Carota, the charming West Village restaurant run by the partners Jody Williams and Rita Sodi, the menu description for insalata verde\u00a0does little to give away any details about what makes it so unbelievably, mouth-smackingly perfect. A visual inspection of the dish reveals only leaves of endive, butter lettuce, fris\u00e9e and watercress all piled as high as gravity will allow, topped by a drizzle of dressing studded generously with shallots and mustard seeds. In truth, all the secrets of this otherworldly salad lay in the graceful, unlikely application of a flavorless one: water. First, the five carefully chosen types of lettuce are all triple-washed to yield what Williams called \u201ca super happy salad.\u201d Next, the minced shallots are given a quick rinse under cold water \u2014 instead of a long maceration in vinegar \u2014 to keep them shalloty and savory and prevent them from becoming too acidic, which could overwhelm the delicate lettuces. And finally, and perhaps most surprising, Williams adds a spoonful of warm water to the vinaigrette. \u201cWe add warm water to make it more palatable,\u201d she explained. \u201cPure vinegar is just too strong \u2014 it assaults the taste buds. We want a salad dressing so savory and delicious that you can eat spoonfuls of it. We want you to be able to drink it!\u201d This might just become your go-to vinaigrette. Spoon it liberally over everything from boiled asparagus to farro salad to steak and fish and roast chicken. It\u2019s so good that you might even be tempted to pour it into a glass and top it off with sparkling water.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/11/dining/11mag-eat-1/12mag-eat-1-articleLarge-v2.png", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "belgian endive, dijon mustard, fris\u00e9e, romaine hearts, thyme, watercress, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2392}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 heads butter lettuce, such as Boston or bibb", "1 romaine heart", "1 large Belgian endive", "1 bunch watercress", "1/2 small head fris\u00e9e", "1 large shallot, minced", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon aged sherry vinegar, plus additional, as needed", "1 tablespoon warm water", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 1/2 teaspoons whole-grain mustard", "1 1/2 teaspoons honey (optional)", "2 sprigs thyme, washed and stripped", "1 large clove garlic, finely grated", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the greens: Fill a sink or large basin with tepid water.
