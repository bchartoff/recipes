{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gajar\u00a0Halwa (Carrot and Cardamom Pudding)", "description": "The recipe for this Indian dessert comes from the North Carolina chef Cheetie Kumar, and it instantly transports her to her mother\u2019s kitchen around Diwali, the air rich with the aroma of fragrant carrots, caramelized milk and cardamom. The carrots are cooked down to be incredibly tender, but they still maintain some texture; the milk becomes jammy. If eaten warm, it\u2019s like a really decadent warm cereal or oatmeal; if served cold, it\u2019s like rice pudding, cool and sweet. The crunch of the toasted nuts make it the perfect meal-ender or tea time snack. If your carrots are bland, increase the sugar accordingly; the sweetness of the carrots makes a huge difference in the finished pudding. Some people prefer a looser halwa, but Ms. Kumar loves the caramelized notes that emerge when the pudding is cooked a little longer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brigid Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/31/dining/31diwalirex2/merlin_145697367_a228c430-4915-40e4-9313-ad78e4bc9e93-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "cardamom, carrot, ghee, milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 53}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 350, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "150 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons ghee or clarified butter", "8 to 10 large peeled and shredded carrots (about 4 cups/455 grams), prepared with a food processor into long strands or grated on the large holes on a box grater", "3 cups/720 milliliters good-quality whole milk", "1/2 teaspoon green cardamom seeds, removed from several pods or purchased already shucked, crushed lightly in mortar and pestle", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar, plus more to taste", "1/4 cup/30 grams chopped toasted pistachios, almonds or a mixture"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a wide, heavy-bottomed skillet (don't use nonstick) over medium heat, melt ghee, then add carrots.
