{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Onion Galette", "description": "This rich, autumnal galette takes its inspiration from the flavors of French onion soup. Seasoned with Gruy\u00e8re and lots of cracked black pepper, the galette dough takes the place of the crostini, and the caramelized onion filling is fortified with beef broth and sherry. The dish is great for entertaining \u2014 it can be prepared in advance \u2014 but requires a little bit of patience: You\u2019ll need to let the dough rest for at least four hours, which allows the flour to hydrate and will make the dough less crumbly to work with. Let the tart rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Eat it while it\u2019s hot or serve at room temperature alongside a salad or steak.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/dining/sl-caramelized-onion-galette/sl-caramelized-onion-galette-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "fall, winter, gruy\u00e8re, make-ahead, party, plan-ahead, sweet onion, tart, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2397}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 1/3 cups/4 ounces grated Gruy\u00e8re", "1/4 cup ice water", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "4 large sweet onions, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch rings", "4 fresh thyme sprigs, plus more fresh thyme leaves for serving", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup beef broth (or vegetable broth)", "1/4 cup dry sherry"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper.
