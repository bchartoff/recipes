{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pistachio, Rose and Strawberry Buns", "description": "Meant for breakfast or as an accompaniment to a mug of hot tea, these Danish-like yeast buns are filled with pistachio cream and strawberry jam, then soaked in a rose water-scented sugar syrup. Adapted from \"Golden,\" a cookbook from Honey & Co. cafe in London, the buns sweet but not at all cloying, with the rose water and pistachio adding a heady perfume. Feel free to substitute apricot or raspberry preserves, or orange marmalade, for the strawberry jam. And if you\u2019re not a fan of rose water, try orange blossom water or even brandy instead. These are best served within eight hours of baking, but leftovers can be refreshed the next day by heating them in a 300-degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until just warmed through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/09/dining/09COOKBOOKS1/09COOKBOOKS1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 buns", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, pastries", "keywords": "dessert, jam, pistachio, rose water", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 103}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 516, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "73 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "43 milligrams", "sugarContent": "41 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, cubed and at room temperature, more for greasing pan", "1 1/2 teaspoons/5 grams active dry yeast", "1 large egg", "2 1/2 tablespoons/30 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters whole milk, more if needed", "2 1/3 cups/300 grams bread flour", "Pinch of kosher salt", "2/3 cup/80 grams pistachios", "6 tablespoons/80 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/80 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "8 teaspoons strawberry jam", "1/2 cups/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon honey", "1 tablespoon rose water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Place butter, yeast, egg, sugar and milk in bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, or a large bowl if working by hand.
