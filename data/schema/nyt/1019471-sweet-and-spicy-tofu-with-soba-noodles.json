{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet and Spicy Tofu With Soba Noodles", "description": "If you don\u2019t cook tofu often (or even if you do), this unfussy tofu dish is for you: There\u2019s no flour-dredging or shallow-frying, and no marinating at all. As long as you pat the tofu dry (a bit fussy, but not by much), the vegetable oil\u2019s high smoke point will yield crisp edges, while the sesame oil imparts flavor, putting you well on your way to making tofu taste great. What\u2019s more, a ginger-and-garlic-laced soy sauce coats noodles and tofu alike, giving you chopstick after chopstick of toothsome pleasure. Serve these warm or cold, and be generous with the cool, crispy vegetables on top, especially for summer picnics where you can stretch this to serve 6 or even 8 as a side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/dining/sc-Sweet-and-Spicy-Tofu-With-Soba-Noodles/sc-Sweet-and-Spicy-Tofu-With-Soba-Noodles-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, noodles", "keywords": "firm tofu, soba noodles, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 797}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 607, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1652 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 (14-ounce) packages firm tofu, drained", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "2 tablespoons sesame oil", "1 (8-ounce) package all-buckwheat soba noodles", "4 garlic cloves, smashed", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 small bunch green onions, white and green parts separated, cut into 2-inch matchsticks", "1/3 cup soy sauce or tamari", "3 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "4 mini or 1 large, thin-skinned cucumber, thinly sliced", "4 radishes, thinly sliced", "Handful of cilantro leaves, for serving", "1 lime, cut in wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain the tofu in a colander, or dry on paper-towel lined plate while you prep the remaining ingredients, about 10 minutes.
