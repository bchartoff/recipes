{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Telepan's Beet and Bulgur Salad", "description": "Most bulgur salads I\u2019ve met follow the tabbouleh model. They are either predominantly tan in color, or predominantly green, depending upon whether the grain or the parsley is emphasized in the recipe.\n\nThis bulgur salad, a recipe from the chef Bill Telepan at Telepan restaurant on the Upper West Side, is exuberantly different. Instead of softening the bulgur in boiling water, his recipe calls for homemade beet broth. And instead of parsley, scallions and tomatoes, pur\u00e9ed beets add vegetable matter to the mix. It\u2019s an earthy, bright and dazzlingly fuchsia take on the familiar salad, as palate-pleasing as it is eye-catching.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/02/dining/dj-take/dj-take-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "beet, bulgur wheat, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 44}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 334, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "129 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound beets", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt, more as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "1 cup medium bulgur wheat", "1/4 cup red wine vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1/3 cup canola oil", "3 tablespoons chopped dill", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
