{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Catalan Fideu\u00e0", "description": "In Catalunya, the northeastern part of Spain, there is a traditional dish called fideu\u00e0, made with short lengths of dry pasta called fideus. Instead of boiling the noodles Italian-style, the Catalan way is to cook them with only a small amount of liquid in a wide earthenware cazuela or paella pan. Here, the noodles are first browned in olive oil, then simmered in a rich fish and shellfish broth. It\u2019s a sort of cross between risotto and paella, and it\u2019s a dish for all lovers of Mediterranean fish soups in the bouillabaisse family. Broth is added at intervals as it is absorbed, but not much stirring is involved. A dab of garlicky allioli, the Spanish version of a\u00efoli, is added to each soup plate before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/26/dining/26KITCH1/26KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "clams, fideus, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 60}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 371, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "921 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 onions, chopped (about 2 cups)", "1/2 pound small shrimp, shell on", "4 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "3 small dried hot red peppers, or use 1 pinch cayenne ", "1/2 teaspoon fennel seed", "1/2 teaspoon coriander seed", "1 large bay leaf", "A few thyme sprigs", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 1/2 pounds meaty bones from cod, snapper or halibut, rinsed (or use boneless fish chunks)", "12 clams", "1 pound mussels, cleaned", "1 pound fideus noodles (dry), or use Italian fedelini or spaghettini ", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Pinch of saffron crumbled into 1/4 cup water", "1 pound mussels, cleaned, for garnish", "1/2 pound large shrimp, shell on, for garnish (optional)", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley", "1 teaspoon orange zest", "Allioli, for garnish (see recipe)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the broth: Put 3 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy soup pot over medium-high heat.
