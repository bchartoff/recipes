{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bacon-Onion Jam", "description": "Here is a shockingly good accompaniment to chicken-liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 that came to The Times from the kitchen of the Fort Defiance in Brooklyn. But don't think that is its only use. Bacon-onion jam is also a terrific sandwich condiment. Paired with crumbled blue cheese, it's a fantastic topping for a serious, grown-up pizza pie. And because the recipe makes a lot of jam, all three options are possible. One note: Take your time. The point is to cook the mixture until it has achieved full jamminess. The onions should really caramelize. Covered, it will keep in the refrigerator for a week or so.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/26/magazine/26eat/mag-26Eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, bacon, jam, onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 233}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 223, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "287 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound slab bacon, diced into cubes", "4 medium-size white or Spanish onions, peeled and diced", "1 1/2 teaspoons mustard seed", "2 1/2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup balsamic vinegar", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat, and add the bacon.
