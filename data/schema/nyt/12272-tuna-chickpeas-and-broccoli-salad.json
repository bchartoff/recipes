{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tuna, Chickpeas and Broccoli Salad", "description": "This recipe is inspired by a common Italian combination, tuna and beans. It\u2019s a salad that keeps well in the refrigerator and one that\u2019s great to have on hand during the week. The broccoli will not retain its pretty green color once in contact with the acid in the dressing, so for best results keep the broccoli separate, along with a tablespoon of the dressing. Just before you want to eat, toss in the broccoli and extra dressing; or eat the broccoli separately with the dressing.
