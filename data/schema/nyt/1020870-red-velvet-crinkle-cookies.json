{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red Velvet Crinkle Cookies", "description": "Two things are required to get the best crinkly effect on these cookies: First, use the right ratio of leaveners (baking powder and baking soda). This causes the cookies to rise, then collapse quickly, which creates those visible cracks on the surface. Second, don\u2019t skimp on the confectioners\u2019 sugar! This recipe calls for two generous dustings before heading into the oven. If the cookies aren\u2019t generously coated, they will absorb all the sugar as they bake. Cocoa powder provides the traditional red velvet flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/dining/ejm-red-velvet-cookies/ejm-red-velvet-cookies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 30 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "butter, cocoa powder, confectioners sugar, egg, flour, red food coloring, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 113}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 1/3 cups/265 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons red food coloring, preferably liquid", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 3/4 cups/350 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons cocoa powder", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/3 cups/165 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
