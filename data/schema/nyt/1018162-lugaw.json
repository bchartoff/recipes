This recipe, adapted from the version served at Uncle Mike's Place, a diner in Chicago, is not supposed to be a wallop of flavors. Approach it as a savory oatmeal, with notes of ginger and chicken peeking through the warm, soothing creaminess. The key is constant stirring during the first 10 minutes of cooking, which aids in breaking down the starches in the rice and makes for a thicker, more luscious dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kevin Pang"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/08/dining/08FILIPINO2-web/08FILIPINO2-web-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken bouillon, chicken breast, ginger, rice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "701 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup medium-grain white rice", "1 1/2 tablespoons concentrated chicken base or 4 bouillon cubes", "1/2 teaspoon\u00a0kosher salt", "1 eight-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breast, very thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 scallion, finely chopped", "2 to 3 round slices lemon, each cut in half"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, combine rice with 10 cups cold water, concentrated chicken base or bouillon and salt.
