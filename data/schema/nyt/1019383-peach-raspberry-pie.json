{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach Raspberry Pie", "description": "The character of fresh raspberries can be fleeting when cooked, especially when the berries are mixed with other fruit like ripe, juicy peaches. To deepen the berry flavor in this summer pie, a little raspberry jam is mixed into the filling in place of some of the sugar. Instant (minute) tapioca serves as a clear, flavorless thickener here, with the tiny tapioca pearls echoing the texture of raspberry seeds. For a runny, syrupy pie that leaks when you cut into it, mix in the minimum amount of tapioca. Using all 3 tablespoons yields a pie with a thick, jammy filling. As for the stone fruit, peel the peaches or don't, to taste. Or substitute ripe nectarines, whose peels are less pronounced.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/04/dining/04apperex/04apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, instant tapioca, lemon, nutmeg, peach, raspberries, raspberry jam, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 258}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 525, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "347 milligrams", "sugarContent": "28 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Large pinch of sugar", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), cold and cut into cubes", "2/3 cup/158 milliliters ice water, more if needed", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters raspberry jam", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/55 grams light brown sugar", "1 1/2 to 3 tablespoons minute (instant) tapioca", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt", "5 cups/770 grams thinly sliced peaches (about 6 to 8 medium peaches)", "1 pint/245 grams raspberries", "1 large egg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt and sugar to combine.
