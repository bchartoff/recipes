We often pass around plates of this vegetarian chopped salad (no bacon) to accompany the drinks before we sit down at the table. The salad is a great mix of bitter and sweet flavors, juicy and crunchy, and comforting, too. Sweet/tart, crisp juicy apples like Braeburns, Jonagolds, Honey Crisp and Granny Smith work well here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/18/science/17recipehealthsalad/17recipehealthsalad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 221}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 215, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "240 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or champagne vinegar", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 small garlic clove, green shoot removed, pur\u00e9ed (optional)", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons walnut oil", "5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "4 to 5 cups chopped bitter lettuces such as radicchio, endive or escarole", "2 crisp, tart, juicy apples, cut in small dice (1/4 inch)", "1/2 cup chopped walnuts", "1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese or feta", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley or a mix of parsley, chives and tarragon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together vinegars, lemon juice, garlic, mustard, salt and pepper.
