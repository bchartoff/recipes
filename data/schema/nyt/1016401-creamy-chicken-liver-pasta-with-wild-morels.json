{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Chicken Liver Pasta With Wild Morels", "description": "Fresh wild mushrooms are the most delicious indulgence, whether it\u2019s gray-brown morels in the springtime, golden chanterelles in the summer, or russet-colored porcini in the fall. True, they are expensive (unless you know how to pick your own), but a mere half-pound is all you need for this creamy pasta \u2014 and chicken livers are cheap. Serve the pasta in small portions; it is undeniably a bit on the rich side. If you can\u2019t find wild mushrooms, use an assortment of cultivated mushrooms, like cremini, oyster mushrooms, King trumpets or shiitake. To give them more wild mushroom flavor, soak just a few a few dried morels or porcini in warm water. When softened, chop them very fine and stir into the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/28/dining/28KITCH1/28KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "chicken liver, morels, pasta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 150}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 568, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "70 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "847 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound wild morels (or other mushrooms)", "1 pound chicken livers", "All-purpose flour, for dusting", "Salt and pepper", "Pinch of cayenne", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 large shallots, finely diced", "1/4 cup dry sherry", "2 to 3 cups chicken stock (or mushroom stock)", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 pound pappardelle or other pasta", "4 egg yolks", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley", "1 tablespoon finely cut chives", "2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, cut into 1/2-inch ribbons (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut stems from mushrooms (reserve for making mushroom stock, if desired) and cut them to bottom into halves or quarters.
