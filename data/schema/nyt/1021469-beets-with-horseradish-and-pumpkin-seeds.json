{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beets With Horseradish and Pumpkin Seeds", "description": "Sweet beets meet zingy horseradish and crunchy pumpkin seeds in this dish that will enchant beet lovers and skeptics alike. Roasting the beets concentrates their flavor and makes them easier to peel, while pairing red beets with their yellow counterparts makes for a striking visual contrast. Feel free to use all red beets, or all golden beets, if that\u2019s what\u2019s available to you, and to substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream. If you can\u2019t find fresh, refrigerated prepared horseradish, horseradish cream also works beautifully. Make the most of the beet greens: Saut\u00e9 them in olive oil and finish with a splash of balsamic vinegar for an excellent accompaniment to this dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/dining/vl-beets/merlin_176253213_75b575c9-9454-48dd-89cb-43fea2cb0824-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "beets, horseradish, lemon juice, pumpkin seeds, red beets, sour cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 490}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small bunch red beets (about 1 pound), washed and leaves removed", "1 small bunch golden beets (about 1 pound), washed and leaves removed", "2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup sour cream", "2 tablespoons prepared horseradish", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/4 cup roasted pumpkin seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
