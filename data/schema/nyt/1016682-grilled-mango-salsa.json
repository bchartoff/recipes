{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Mango Salsa", "description": "A mango\u2019s rich flavor is deepened through grilling in this salsa full of contrasts. It also works if you do not want to grill the mango. I love mango salsa whether or not the mango is grilled, so if you don\u2019t feel like grilling, you can still get a great salsa with these ingredients. Grilling, whether on an outdoor grill, a griddle or a grill pan, deepens the flavor of an already-rich-tasting fruit. I love the contrasts in this salsa: the crisp jicama with the soft, juicy mango; the sweet fruit; the spicy chile; and the grassy cilantro. Serve with fish or chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/29/science/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low calorie, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 23}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 96, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "411 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large ripe but firm mango", "1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil or grapeseed oil", "2 small Roma tomatoes (5 to 6 ounces) cut in small dice (about 2/3 cup diced tomato)", "1/2 small jicama (about 4 ounces), peeled and finely chopped (about 2/3 cup)", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "Salt to taste", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "1 or 2 serrano or jalape\u00f1o peppers, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a medium-hot grill.
