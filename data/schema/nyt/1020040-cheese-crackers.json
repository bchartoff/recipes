Known by many names and claimed by many grandmothers, they are all the same, delicious thing: a savory, addictive, shortbread cookie. The key to any short dough \u2014 that distinctive tender sandy crumbly texture \u2014 is the high fat-to-flour ratio, and this version not only relies on butter but also counts on the delicious fats that come from sesame seeds, block Cheddar and even the oil from the pecans. For a remarkable distinction among the many, many versions of these to be found, toast them until just passing golden into brown, and see how that in itself sets these apart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/magazine/24mag-eat-slideshow-slide-5TJ9/24mag-eat-slideshow-slide-5TJ9-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "About 6 dozen crackers", "recipeCuisine": "american, south american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, crackers and chips", "keywords": "appetizer, cayenne pepper, cheddar, pecorino romano, sesame seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 371}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 31, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "16 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour", "1 cup loosely packed grated Cabot Farms Vermont white Cheddar (about 3 ounces)", "2/3 cup loosely packed grated pecorino Romano cheese (about 1 ounce)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne", "8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "1 large egg yolk", "1/3 cup pecans, finely chopped (about 3 tablespoons)", "3 tablespoons untoasted white sesame seeds", "2 tablespoons ice water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the flour, both cheeses, salt and cayenne to the bowl of a food processor, and pulse until combined."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Scatter the cold butter chunks on top, and pulse again to form coarse crumbs."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add egg yolk, pecans and seeds, and pulse to combine thoroughly, yielding a coarse grainy meal."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Transfer mixture to a large stainless-steel bowl.
