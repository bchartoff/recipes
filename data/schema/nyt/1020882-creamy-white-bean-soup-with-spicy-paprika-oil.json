An artful drizzle\u00a0of paprika oil enlivens it. While the soup simmers, toast red-pepper flakes and smoked paprika in olive oil to make a vibrant red sauce inspired by Chinese chile oil. The soup is great before blending \u2014 it\u2019s more like a stew \u2014 but pur\u00e9es to a creamy white. You could top the soup with saut\u00e9ed quartered button mushrooms, roasted vegetables or toasted croutons, but the paprika oil provides deep flavor, and is the only garnish you truly need.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/19/dining/aw-white-bean-soup/merlin_169064754_388259e5-897c-44c9-b83a-6ac6f59624f4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings (8 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 386}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3 large shallots, minced (about 2/3 cup)", "4 large celery stalks, peeled and thinly sliced", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "3 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning or herbes de Provence", "1 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds (optional)", "3/4 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 cups chicken or vegetable stock", "3 (14-ounce) cans cannellini beans (or chickpeas), rinsed", "2 cups half-and-half or almond milk", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons smoked (hot or sweet) paprika", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the soup: In a large pot, heat 1/4 cup oil over medium.
