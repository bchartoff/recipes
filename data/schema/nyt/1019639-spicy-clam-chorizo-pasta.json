{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Clam Chorizo Pasta", "description": "Clams work their way into plenty of dishes in the Baja Peninsula of Mexico, which is where the chef Pati Jinich picked up this recipe for pasta con salsa picante de chorizo y almejas. The dish, which she featured on an episode of her PBS show, \u201cPati\u2019s Mexican Table,\u201d is a nod to the prized clams that are harvested in and around the coastal lagoons on Mexico\u2019s Pacific shores. It pays homage to the surf-and-turf dishes in Tijuana, where cooks find seemingly endless ways to mix meat and seafood on a single plate. The dish takes its aggressive heat from chorizo and chiles de arbol, but it can be dialed down by substituting 1/2 teaspoon or less of red-pepper flakes. The beer in the dish is Ms. Jinich\u2019s nod to the craft-beer boom in Baja.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/10jinichrex2/merlin_144843666_2bf75529-706c-4433-ac1b-1dcb95e1e449-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 large servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas, seafood", "keywords": "chiles de \u00e1rbol, chorizo, clams, crushed canned tomatoes, spaghetti, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 71}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1034, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "117 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1877 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 to 5 dozen small littleneck clams", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 pound chorizo sausage, casings removed and filling chopped", "1 cup finely chopped white onion", "5 garlic cloves, pressed or finely chopped", "2 chiles de arbol, stemmed and chopped (keep the seeds), plus more to taste", "1 cup light beer", "1/2 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, or to taste", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 teaspoon honey", "1 pound spaghetti", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse and scrub the clams under cold water, making sure they are closed and unbroken.
