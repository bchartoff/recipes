{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kaddu (Sweet and Sour Butternut Squash)", "description": "This cozy vegetable main is an ode to earthy, maple-y fenugreek, a staple spice of Indian cooking that is a perfect match for the mild sweetness of butternut squash. Normally roasted, butternut squash is gently stewed here with ginger, onion, turmeric, tomatoes and brown sugar, bringing out a unique and addictive sweet-and-sour flavor. Kaddu is traditionally paired with puri, a type of fried bread, but roti, tortillas and even toast work well with this bright and hearty one-pot dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/12/dining/pk-kaddu/pk-kaddu-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "butternut squash, cilantro, fenugreek, ginger, lime, turmeric, fall, winter, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 small yellow onion, finely diced", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "1/2 teaspoon red chile powder, such as cayenne", "1/4 teaspoon asafetida (optional)", "1 medium butternut squash (about 2 pounds), peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "4 medium Roma tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from about 1 lime), plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons light brown sugar", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (stems and leaves), for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) deep saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, warm the oil.
