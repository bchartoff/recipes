{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blood Orange Butterscotch Meringue Pie", "description": "With a snappy filling of blood orange curd that\u2019s crowned by a glossy brown sugar meringue, this variation on the classic lemon meringue pie is slightly sweeter and juicier than the original, and just as eye-catching with its swirly, golden topping. If you can\u2019t find blood oranges, regular oranges or tangerines make fine substitutes. This pie is best served the day it\u2019s baked, though you can make the dough and filling up to five days in advance. The meringue, however, needs to be whipped up just before the pie is baked. Store leftovers in a sealed container at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/09/dining/07apperex2-butterscotch/07apperex2-butterscotch-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "blood orange, cream of tartar, eggs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 134}, "recipeIngredient": ["All-purpose flour, for rolling out dough", "Dough for 1 (9-inch)\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-pie-crust\">pie</a>", "4 egg yolks (save whites for the meringue)", "1 large egg", "2/3 cup/133 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters freshly squeezed lemon juice", "3/4 cup/177 milliliters freshly squeezed blood orange juice (from 3 to 5 oranges)", "1 tablespoon finely grated blood orange zest, plus more for garnish", "Pinch of salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch\u00a0pieces", "4 egg whites, at room temperature", "1 packed cup/210 grams light brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: On a lightly floured surface, and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll pie dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick.
