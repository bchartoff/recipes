While molasses-covered popcorn was already popular in the Northeast, the creation of Cracker Jack\u2019s special formula is credited to German brothers Frederick William and Louis Rueckheim. Besides coming up with the signature combination of popcorn, molasses and peanuts, they even devised a special package to keep it fresh and crisp. By the late 1800s, the snack was so loved that their company was producing four-and-a-half tons a day. This homemade version is best enjoyed the day it\u2019s made, though it will keep for up to three days in an airtight container. Use large, red-skinned peanuts in this recipe if you can find them, as the skins lend a pleasant bitterness that works well with the molasses-caramel coating.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/21/autossell/homemade_cracker_jacks_thumb/homemade_cracker_jacks_thumb-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 16 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "candies", "keywords": "peanut, popcorn", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 281}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons neutral oil, plus more for greasing the pans", "1/2 cup popcorn kernels", "1 cup roasted, salted red-skinned peanuts", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 cup unsalted butter, chopped into pieces", "1 packed cup light brown sugar", "1/4 cup molasses\u00a0", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 250 degrees and grease two large rimmed baking sheets with neutral oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the remaining 3 tablespoons neutral oil and 2 kernels to a large pot.
