{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Butternut Squash With Brown Butter Vinaigrette", "description": "This roasted butternut squash is every bit as caramelized as you\u2019d want it to be, without the prep work that\u2019s usually involved. First, it\u2019s cooked without being peeled: The skin is a crisp counterpart to the jammy interior. (If you do want to get rid of the peel, it tears away easily after roasting.) Then, it\u2019s dressed with a vinaigrette made with brown butter, vinegar and dried chile. Mint is added for freshness and flaky salt for crunch, and you could also throw on some cheese \u2014 Parmesan, Gruy\u00e8re, ricotta \u2014 for more richness. Serve the squash over sturdy salad greens, or add nuts or pepitas to the browning butter for more texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/23/dining/as-roasted-butternut-squash/as-roasted-butternut-squash-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "brown butter, butter, butternut squash, mint, fall, winter, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 784}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large butternut squash (3 to 4 pounds)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup fresh mint leaves (optional)", "Flaky salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange a rack at the bottom of the oven and heat to 425 degrees.
