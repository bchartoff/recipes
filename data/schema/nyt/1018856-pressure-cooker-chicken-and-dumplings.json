This one is relatively classic, though I\u2019ve added some chives to the dumplings for color and freshness. But feel free to leave them out for something more traditionally beige. Or stir in a handful of thawed frozen peas at the end for sweetness and a touch of green.\n\nI prefer using all dark meat here\u2014a combination of drumsticks and thighs gives great flavor and won\u2019t overcook as readily as white meat. But use whatever pieces you like, or a combination. If using all white meat, cook it for a minute or two less.\n\n\n<i>This is one of <a href=\"/68861692/7716592-melissa-clark-dinner-in-an-instant\">10 recipes</a> from Melissa Clark\u2019s \u201cDinner in an Instant: 75 Modern Recipes for Your Pressure Cooker, Multicooker, and Instant Pot\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2017).</i>\n\n<i>Melissa Clark\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562277/dinner-in-an-instant-by-melissa-clark/9781524762964/\">\u201cDinner in an Instant\u201d</a> is available everywhere books are sold. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Instant-Recipes-Pressure-Multicooker-ebook/dp/B06XK41BQV/?tag=NYTBks-20&ascsubtag=dinnerinstant\">Order your copy today.</a></i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/25/dining/chickendumplings/chickendumplings-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, cookbook exclusive, dumplings, poultry, soups and stews", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, chicken, chicken stock, chives, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 333}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 609, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1207 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 pounds bone-in chicken pieces, preferably dark meat", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter", "2 carrots, diced", "2 celery stalks, diced", "1 Spanish onion, diced", "1 turnip, peeled and diced", "4 garlic cloves, smashed", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 quart <a href=\"/recipes/1018861\">chicken stock</a>, preferably homemade", "Chopped fresh parsley or celery leaves, for serving", "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup fine cornmeal", "1/4 cup minced fresh chive (optional)", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons butter, melted", "3/4 cup whole milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, toss the chicken pieces with the salt and pepper.
