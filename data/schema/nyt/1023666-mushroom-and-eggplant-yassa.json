It\u2019s the result of slowly caramelized onions, chile, garlic and ginger simmered in stock and finished with a splash of lime juice. This vegetable version, a vegan adaptation, uses mushrooms and eggplants, which both add layers of depth to the sauce. A shower of thinly sliced fresh scallions announces itself with its delicate yet crisp bite. Serve a generous helping of the sauce over steamed rice, millet or fonio, along with additional lime wedges for squeezing, if desired.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/29/dining/yk-mushroom-yassa/yk-mushroom-yassa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 Servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "eggplant, mushroom, scotch bonnet, senegalese, yellow onion, healthy, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 181}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola, plus more as needed", "1 pound baby bella or button mushrooms, sliced", "Salt and black pepper", "8 thyme sprigs", "2 large yellow onions (about 1 1/2 pounds total), thinly sliced", "1 Scotch bonnet chile", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, scrubbed and grated", "2 fresh or dried bay leaves", "1 medium eggplant (about 1 1/4 pounds), trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes", "2 cups vegetable stock", "2 limes", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "2 scallions, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high.
