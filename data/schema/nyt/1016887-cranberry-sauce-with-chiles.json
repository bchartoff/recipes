Cooks put them in everything from Hatch turkey rubs to chipotle mashed potatoes to chiltepin cranberry sauce, which uses the small, round, fiery hot chiles that are native to Arizona and northern Mexico. You can make this sauce a day ahead and chill it; if it's too stiff for your tastes when you remove it from the fridge, add a little water and sugar, reheat until simmering and then cool once more.
