{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Granola", "description": "Studded with pink freeze-dried strawberries and lightly spiced, this strawberry granola makes for a perky start to the day or a fruity afternoon snack, especially when paired with yogurt or milk. First, roast oats, almonds, pumpkin seeds and coconut chips in a sweet syrup before mixing with crisp freeze-dried strawberries. Optional red-pepper flakes add a pleasant whisper of warmth, and play well with the strawberries and coconut. Feel free to substitute cashews or hazelnuts for the almonds, and omit the coconut chips if you don\u2019t have them in the pantry. The resulting granola will still be full of flavor and crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/dining/dg-strawberry-granola/merlin_171207453_4fc3e59e-f2af-4820-9606-9ae3b35cc77d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, grains and rice", "keywords": "almonds, coconut, oats, old-fashioned rolled oats, strawberry", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/200 grams rolled, old-fashioned (not quick-cooking) oats", "3/4 cup/100 grams raw or roasted almonds, hazelnuts or cashews, roughly chopped", "3/4 cup/40 grams unsweetened, raw coconut chips (optional)", "1/2 cup/70 grams raw pepitas (shelled pumpkin seeds)", "1/4 cup/70 grams honey", "1/4 cup/40 grams coconut sugar, packed light or dark brown sugar or granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters coconut oil or olive oil", "1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/20 grams freeze-dried strawberries (optional)", "Strawberry jam and yogurt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 300 degrees and set one rack in the middle of the oven.
