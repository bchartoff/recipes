{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Pork With Whole Spices and Garlic Bread", "description": "Deeply flavored from a rub of fennel, coriander, caraway and cumin, and crisp-edged from the grill, this pork feeds a crowd, and most of the work can be done in advance. You can use either boneless loin or shoulder here: The shoulder is chewier, brawnier and more irregular in shape, while the loin is neater to slice and softer to eat. But both are delicious, especially when showered with fresh lemon or lime juice at the end to cut the richness. You don\u2019t have to make the buttery garlic bread, but its herbal flavors go well with the smoke and char of the meat. If you do skip it (your loss), serve the pork strewn with plenty of fresh, bright herbs. If you\u2019re not grilling, you can roast the pork in a 500-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, flipping it halfway. Then run it under the broiler at the end to sear the fat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/29/dining/24apperex/merlin_154665933_7c505765-cddd-4137-bcb7-42eb68d7d1a9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, barbecues, meat, project", "keywords": "bread, butter, garlic, pork shoulder, thyme, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 210}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup fresh thyme leaves, plus more for serving", "4 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "1 tablespoon cumin seeds", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds", "1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds", "1 1/2 teaspoons black peppercorns", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "12 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons red-wine vinegar", "5 to 6 pounds boneless, skinless pork shoulder or loin, butterflied (see Note)", "Lemon or lime wedges, for serving", "3/4 cup unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks)", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/3 cup finely minced parsley", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil", "5 garlic cloves, finely grated or pounded into a paste", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "3/4 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/4 teaspoon red-wine vinegar", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste", "2 (12-inch) loaves French or Italian bread, halved lengthwise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pork: Using a mortar and pestle, pound together the thyme, salt, cumin, coriander, fennel, caraway, peppercorns and red-pepper flakes until the spices are well cracked but not ground.
