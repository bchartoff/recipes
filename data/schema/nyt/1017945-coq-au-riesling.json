{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coq au Riesling", "description": "The chicken stew here does have an authentic origin, but I have lightened it a little by dispensing with the cream that would be added luxuriously in its country of origin. And you can cheerfully use a dry or semi-dry from anywhere in the world. I have nothing against the regular coq au vin, but I might actually prefer this sprightlier version. It's certainly easier to make: in place of all those whole baby onions, which have to be peeled one by one, you can just chop your onions the usual and considerably less bothersome way. And since I always think that the breast meat of a chicken can be a bit stringy when cooked for a long time, I instead choose thigh portions. So no dismembering of a carcass is required either.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/23/dining/23COOKING_COQAURIESLING1/23COOKING_COQAURIESLING1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1478}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 842, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "57 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "458 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces sliced bacon, sliced crosswise into 1-inch pieces", "3 medium onions, peeled and roughly chopped", "10 chicken thighs, with skin and bone", "8 ounces button mushrooms, halved", "2 or 3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley", "3 tablespoons chopped tarragon", "1 bottle dry or off-dry riesling wine (750 ml)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place large flameproof casserole or other heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat.
