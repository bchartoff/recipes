{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Chicken With 40 Cloves of Garlic", "description": "Typically, chicken with 40 cloves of garlic needs to cook for a long time to mellow out all that garlicky sharpness, but in this recipe, a pressure cooker softens and sweetens the garlic in record time. Still, 40 cloves is for the most dedicated garlic lovers, so feel free to reduce the quantity if you like; the recipe will work all the same. The addition of beans to the classic dish makes it a one-pot meal. The chicken skin won\u2019t be crisp at the end of cooking, so if that bothers you, discard it afterward \u2014 it will have done its duty, imparting deep chicken flavor to the dish \u2014 or you could place the thighs on a baking sheet and set them under the broiler to brown just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/30/dining/sdg-pressure-cooker-chicken-and-white-beans-with-garlic/merlin_168064362_a8446dc8-3c24-436a-9124-82ed4734c638-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, one pot, poultry", "keywords": "cannellini beans, chicken thigh, garlic, lemon, white wine, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 53}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 4 to 6 large thighs)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "40 garlic cloves (3 to 4 heads of garlic), smashed", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 cup white wine", "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar", "1 (28-ounce) can or 2 (14-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained", "2 fresh thyme sprigs or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/2 lemon, juiced (about 1 tablespoon)", "2 scallions, white and light green parts thinly sliced", "1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the chicken generously all over with salt and pepper.
