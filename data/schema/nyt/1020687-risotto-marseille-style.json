{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Risotto Marseille-Style", "description": "This recipe incorporates the components of a bouillabaisse into a risotto. The broth used to gradually soften the rice is seasoned with saffron, fennel and garlic, as it would be for the Marseillaise fish stew. The garlic mayonnaise, aioli, adds a finishing touch of sleek richness. As for the specifics of the seafood, I\u2019ve used mussels, scallops, monkfish and shrimp, the last added at the very end to avoid overcooking. In place of monkfish you might consider halibut, tilefish or Alaskan black cod; clams could replace the mussels, and chunks of lobster could also be added. But salmon does not belong in this crowd.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/25/dining/19pairrex1/merlin_166104600_4eae3afd-7466-4afb-b9ac-b9d9d842dbec-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, seafood", "keywords": "arborio rice, dry white wine, fennel, mayonnaise, monkfish, mussels, sea scallop, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dry white wine", "24 mussels", "3 cups fish stock", "1 tablespoon saffron threads", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Salt", "3 large garlic cloves, minced (about 2 1/2 teaspoons)", "1 teaspoon Espelette pepper or hot paprika, or more to taste", "1/2 cup mayonnaise, homemade or store-bought", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup finely minced fennel bulb", "1 cup Arborio rice", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1/2 pound monkfish, in 8 slices", "12 sea scallops, trimmed and quartered", "16 medium shrimp, preferably wild, peeled and deveined"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place 1/2 cup wine in a 2-quart saucepan, add the mussels, bring to a simmer and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar.
