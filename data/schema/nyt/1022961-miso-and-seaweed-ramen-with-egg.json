{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso and Seaweed Ramen With Egg", "description": "This weeknight ramen features a soothing broth that comes together in just 30 minutes with the help of rich seaweed and sweet-salty miso. Dried wakame is a dark green, edible seaweed with a delicately sweet flavor; once cooked, it softens and transforms into a tender, smooth and silky texture. Caramelizing the miso with earthy shiitake mushrooms adds extra depth and body to the meatless broth. A nutty, scallion-flecked sesame-ginger sauce adds brightness and a fresh crunch to the cozy soup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/02/dining/kc-miso-and-seaweed-ramen-with-egg/merlin_201183684_6c4cc7aa-61fd-47e7-be5a-194c1e502579-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "egg, mushroom, ramen, seaweed, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 797}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola\u00a0", "4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced", "3/4 cup finely chopped scallions, plus more for garnish", "Salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1/3 cup white miso", "2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "1/4 cup dried ready-cut wakame seaweed", "1 pound fresh ramen noodles (see Tip)", "4 large eggs", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds", "2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil over medium.
