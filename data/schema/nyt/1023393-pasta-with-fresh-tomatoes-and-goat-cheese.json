This recipe makes good use of those summer tomatoes with juices just barely contained by their thin skins. The creamy cheese is goat cheese, whose tang balances the sweetness of the tomatoes. Parmesan adds salty depth, while herbs and red-pepper flakes complete the dish. For a more filling pasta, feel free to add shrimp, corn or green beans to the boiling pasta in the last few minutes of cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/09/dining/as-tomato-goat-cheese-pasta/as-tomato-goat-cheese-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "fusilli, goat cheese, parmesan, tomato, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 738}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "2 pounds very ripe tomatoes, coarsely chopped", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme or oregano leaves", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed", "2 ounces Parmesan cheese, coarsely grated, plus more as needed", "1 pound fusilli or another spiral pasta", "1 (4-ounce) log goat cheese, crumbled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the tomatoes, thyme, red-pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
