Cilantro adds freshness, and a few drops of your favorite hot sauce will deliver a nice zing. The nontraditional open-ended rolling technique used here will tightly encase the filling in the smaller-size tortillas while ensuring the optimal tortilla-to-stuffing ratio. To seal completely, wrap each tortilla in a strip of foil and twist both ends. For convenience, the little wraps can be made ahead of time, stored in the refrigerator or freezer and reheated in an oven.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/09/dining/YK-breakfast-burritos/merlin_193478334_f0b2e379-557d-490d-9543-61a2d41d6740-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "avocado, burrito, eggs, freezer friendly, make-ahead, refried beans, tortilla, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1087}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 medium (soft taco-size) flour tortillas", "5 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, coarsely grated (1 1/4 cups)", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 cup refried black beans (from a 16-ounce can)\u00a0", "6 large eggs, beaten\u00a0", "Kosher salt", "Hot sauce, for drizzling (optional)", "1 small ripe avocado, pitted, peeled and sliced", "1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat broiler to high and line two sheet pans with foil.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the tortillas on the sheet pans.
