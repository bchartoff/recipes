Add the flour and stir to create a loose dough or thick batter. Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, to age. (We used all the starter for our biscuits. You can double the starter recipe and have some left over to make more biscuits later. It will keep in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days. These are called biscuits, incidentally, not only because they have butter in them but because they contain baking powder in addition to the sourdough starter.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the biscuits, mix together the flour, butter, sugar, salt and baking powder. Add the starter and mix well. The mixture will form a fairly sticky dough. Pinch off golf-ball-size pieces (2 ounces each) of the dough and arrange 1-inch apart on a large cookie sheet. Let them proof at room temperature for about 30 to 40 minutes. Place in a 400-degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until cooked through and nicely browned."}]}
