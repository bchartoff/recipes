{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoked Gouda and Broccoli Flatbreads", "description": "There are equal amounts of cheese and broccoli on this flatbread, but it\u2019s the smoked Gouda that grabs your attention. Its buttery and lightly smoked flavor is accentuated by the scallions, which sweeten and brown as they roast. These are super speedy with the help of store-bought flatbread, naan or pocketless pita, but because the breads vary in size, adjust the quantity of topping to cover yours. (If you have extra toppings, make a melt on toast). Feel free to adapt with what you have: Swap out Gouda for another melting cheese like Cheddar or fontina; and for the broccoli, substitute spinach, kale, thinly sliced brussels sprouts or another quick-cooking vegetable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/06/dining/AS-Smoked-Gouda-and-Broccoli-Flatbreads/AS-Smoked-Gouda-and-Broccoli-Flatbreads-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "bread, broccoli, cheese, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 652}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces smoked Gouda, grated on the small holes of a box grater (about 2 cups)", "8 ounces broccoli stems and florets, coarsely chopped (about 3 cups)", "3 scallions, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 flatbread, naan or pocketless pita (roughly 8-inch diameter, store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013598-naan-indian-flatbread\">homemade</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees and place a rack in the lower and upper third of the oven.
