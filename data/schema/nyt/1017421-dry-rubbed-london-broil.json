{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dry-Rubbed London Broil", "description": "Here is a cheap beef dinner of uncommon flavor, perfect for serving to a crowd. It calls for the process known as indirect grilling, in which you build a fire on one side of your grill and cook on the other, so that the dry-rubbed meat is never in direct contact with flame. (If you grill the meat directly, the sugar and spices will burn rather than melt into appetizing darkness.) The recipe is forgiving. You might add granulated onion or garlic powder to it, or omit the coriander if you don\u2019t have any. Be careful with the paprika as there are so many different varieties afoot: if it\u2019s smoked, you\u2019ll need less, and if it\u2019s fiery you may need less cayenne. (No cayenne? Use red pepper flakes.) Adjust the seasonings to your taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20ENTREE4/20ENTREE4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "coriander, cumin, london broil, paprika, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 446}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 142, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "184 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 London broil, top round or flank steak, approximately 2 1/2 pounds, about 1-inch thick", "1/2 cup paprika, or 1/3 cup smoked paprika", "1/4 cup kosher salt", "1/4 cup freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup brown sugar", "1/4 cup chile powder", "3 tablespoons ground cumin", "2 tablespoons ground coriander", "1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017417-all-purpose-dry-rub\">dry rub</a>.
