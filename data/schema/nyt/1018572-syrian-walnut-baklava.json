{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Syrian Walnut Baklava", "description": "Marhaf Homsi learned to make this Syrian-style walnut baklava from his family in Hama. The baklava he and his wife, Nawal Wardeh, now bake in Brooklyn and sell at their online store, Syrian Sweet Refuge, is less intensely sweet than the sticky confection familiar to many Americans. Cut into large squares, as is traditional in Hama, where the couple ran a bakery for 30 years, the baklava is lightly soaked in a lemon sugar syrup, rather than honey. Use the best quality walnuts available and chop them by hand; Mr. Homsi finds that walnuts chopped in a food processor get bruised and overly pulverized, creating a powdery texture. Be sure to leave time to defrost frozen phyllo dough, which takes 2 hours to thaw on the counter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/08/dining/08SYRIAN3/08SYRIAN3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "24 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "clarified butter, orange blossom water, phyllo dough, walnut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 299, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "81 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["13 ounces/367 grams walnuts (3 1/4 cups whole walnuts)", "1 teaspoon confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 teaspoon orange blossom water", "1 package phyllo dough (1 pound, about 30 sheets, sized as close as possible to 13 x 18 inches), defrosted if frozen", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams clarified butter or ghee, melted", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
