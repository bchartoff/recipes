{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rose Apple Tart", "description": "This striking tart is all about the apples, and \u2014 believe it or not \u2014 it\u2019s fairly simple to make. The crust is the pat-in-the-pan variety, and a mandoline makes quick work of slicing. For the most beautiful results, use firm tart apples with red or pink skin like Honeycrisp, Empire or Cortland, and stand the slices up vertically, rather than laying them flat. This tart is best the day it's made, but the shell can be made a day in advance, if you\u2019d like to break up the work a bit. If you keep vanilla sugar in your pantry, this would be a great place for it. A sprinkle of cardamom wouldn\u2019t hurt either. However you choose to embellish, make sure to use a smooth apricot jam, rather than chunky preserves, for a smooth finish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/dining/ya-apple-rosette-tart/ya-apple-rosette-tart-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, french", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "apple, apricot jam, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 170}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 291, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "162 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/65 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "10 tablespoons/140 grams cold unsalted butter (1 1/4 sticks), cut into 1/2-inch pieces,\u00a0plus more for greasing the pan", "1 egg yolk", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 tablespoons cold water, as needed", "3 medium crisp, tart apples like Honeycrisp, Empire or Cortland\u00a0(about 1 pound)", "1/4 cup/50 grams sugar", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "Large pinch of kosher salt", "3 tablespoons smooth apricot jam"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Combine the flour, confectioners' sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.
