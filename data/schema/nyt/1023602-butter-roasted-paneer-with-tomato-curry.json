{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butter-Roasted Paneer With Tomato Curry", "description": "Roasting mild paneer with yogurt and ghee (or butter) gives it a complex, toasty flavor that\u2019s balanced by the spices and gentle acidity of a quickly made tomato curry. This recipe is adapted from Anita Jaisinghani of Pondicheri in Houston. She prepares her own paneer several times a week to use in curries, salads and crumbled over roasted vegetables. But store-bought paneer will work well here and makes this satisfying dish supremely weeknight friendly. Serve it with rice or flatbread on the side, if you like, to catch the heady sauce. If you have dried fenugreek leaves, you can crumble a tablespoon or so into the curry right at the end.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/02/dining/26apperex-paneer/merlin_214834068_c444213c-c828-463a-9824-9a4e7b1f40f9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, curries, main course", "keywords": "canned plum tomatoes, cardamom, cilantro, garam masala, paneer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 427}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 to 1 1/4 pounds paneer, cut into 1-inch cubes (2 to 3 packages, depending on size)", "5 to 6 tablespoons plain whole-milk Greek yogurt", "3 tablespoons ghee or unsalted butter, melted", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as vegetable, safflower or grapeseed oil", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)", "2 cardamom pods, cracked", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped", "3 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated", "2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger (from about 3/4-inch piece)", "2 teaspoons garam masala", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Pinch of ground cayenne or red-pepper flakes", "1 (15-ounce) can whole plum tomatoes", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing bowl, combine paneer, 3 tablespoons yogurt and ghee.
