{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Maple Cornbread", "description": "Sweetened with brown sugar and maple syrup, this cornbread is hardly typical and extremely versatile: It would be just as welcome as a Thanksgiving side as it would be as breakfast, a snack or even a light dessert. Should you have any leftovers, try toasting cubes of the cornbread in the oven and serving them warm with poached fruit and yogurt or ice cream. Though you may find fine, medium and coarse ground cornmeal at your supermarket, be sure to use finely ground. Its downy texture is best suited for this recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/07/dining/ss-maple-pumpkin-cornbread/ss-maple-pumpkin-cornbread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "9 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads, quick breads", "keywords": "buttermilk, cornmeal, maple syrup, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, fall, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 275}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/140 grams unsalted butter (1 1/4 stick), melted and cooled slightly, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 cup/180 grams finely ground yellow cornmeal", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 large egg", "3/4 cup/165 grams packed light or dark brown sugar", "1 cup/240 milliliters canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters buttermilk", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/150 milliliters maple syrup", "1/4 cup/15 grams\u00a0pumpkin seeds (pepitas)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
