Pair that with a slightly chilled red wine and someone special and you can figure out the rest later.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/11/dining/ss-salad-with-gruyere/merlin_147141453_907e7742-b596-4def-bbce-c35ff1eb0f4a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, arugula, belgian endive, gruy\u00e8re", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 172}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 669, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "791 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 Yukon Gold potatoes, about 5 ounces each, peeled and quartered lengthwise", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "10 ounces bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "2 shallots, finely chopped", "1 cup white wine", "1 cup heavy cream, or more if needed", "2 cups shredded Gruy\u00e8re cheese", "1 1/2 teaspoons sherry vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 head Belgian endive, leaves separated", "4 to 6 cups cleaned, torn arugula or dandelion greens"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
