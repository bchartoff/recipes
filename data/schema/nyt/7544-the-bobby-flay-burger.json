The result continues to amaze.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Reynolds"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/27/dining/27COOKING-BURGER2/27COOKING-BURGER2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "lunch", "keywords": "burger buns, ground chuck, swiss cheese, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 180}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 629, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "49 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1374 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground chuck", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 hamburger buns, split", "1/4 cup best-quality mayonnaise", "1/4 cup Dijon mustard", "8 slices thinly sliced Swiss cheese", "4 slices thinly sliced smoked ham", "2 large dill pickles, sliced lengthwise into 8 slices"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Form meat into 4 patties.
