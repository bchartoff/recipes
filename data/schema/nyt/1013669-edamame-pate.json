{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Edamame P\u00e2t\u00e9", "description": "This is an adaptation of a dish that I created in my early vegetarian days, when we cooked a lot with soybeans \u2014 although nobody really liked them. It occurred to me one day to add Marmite or Savorex, yeast extracts with an intense, somewhat meaty taste, and to use other seasonings from traditional p\u00e2t\u00e9s to achieve a liverlike flavor.  I recreated this p\u00e2t\u00e9 with fresh green soybeans, which takes all the hassle out of the original recipe. A quick word about the yeast extract, which many of you may object to because of the high glutamate content. If you use Vegemite, which is lower in glutamates than Marmite, one serving of this p\u00e2t\u00e9 (if serving eight) will contain 29 milligrams of free glutamates. To put that in perspective, one ounce of Parmesan cheese contains 300 milligrams of glutamates.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/29/science/01recipehealth/01recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Eight to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, edamame, milk, vegemite, healthy, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 104, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "159 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "1 12-ounce bag frozen edamame (or use 2 heaped cups unfrozen), simmered for five minutes in lightly salted water and drained", "2 eggs", "1/3 cup milk (1 percent or 2 percent)", "2 tablespoons brandy (optional; if not using, add 2 more tablespoons milk)", "2 teaspoons yeast extract, like Vegemite, Savorex or Marmite", "2 teaspoons tamari soy sauce", "2 garlic cloves", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped, or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/8 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/8 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon salt (more to taste)", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
