{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Noodles With Seared Pork, Carrots and Herbs", "description": "Vietnamese-style marinated pork chops are often served whole with rice noodles, herbs and a dipping sauce. This version mixes all the components, infusing the noodles, sliced meat and vegetables with the sauce and keeping the noodles tender even after a day in the fridge. Dark, robust maple syrup takes the place of the traditional dark caramel in a nod to autumn (and as a weeknight shortcut to save you the hassle of browning sugar). The pork takes only a few minutes to cook, the noodles about 3, so this whole dish comes together really fast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/dining/gk-Rice-Noodle-Salad-horizontal/gk-Rice-Noodle-Salad-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weekday, weeknight, noodles", "keywords": "carrot, lime, pork chops, rice noodles, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 153}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 452, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1413 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup fish sauce", "1/4 cup dark, pure maple syrup", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil", "Black pepper", "2 large shallots, thinly sliced (3/4 cup)", "1 long red finger chile, thinly sliced (1/3 cup)", "3 small garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)", "4 thin (1/2-inch) boneless pork chops (3/4 to 1 pound total)", "1/3 cup fresh lime juice (from about 3 limes), plus lime wedges for serving", "3 carrots, peeled and julienned (2 cups)", "Kosher salt", "8 to 9 ounces thin rice vermicelli noodles", "2 packed cups torn fresh herbs, such as cilantro, basil and dill (2 1/2 ounces), plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk the fish sauce, syrup, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.
