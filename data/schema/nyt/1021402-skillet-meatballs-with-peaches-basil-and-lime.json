Make sure to use ripe or even overripe peaches (or nectarines).\u00a0They should be very soft so they cook quickly, and very sweet so they contrast with the savory meatballs and tangy lime juice. Rice or rice noodles would fill this meal out perfectly and substantially, as would a crisp-leafed salad for a lighter, more summery supper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/13/dining/28appetite-meatballs2/merlin_176001795_081fd9a5-e477-4647-8726-6b8d769da811-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, meat, meatballs, main course", "keywords": "basil, garlic, ginger, peach, pork, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 4191}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons finely grated or minced fresh ginger", "3 garlic cloves, grated or minced", "1 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, plus more for serving", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 pound ground pork (or turkey or chicken, or vegan meat)", "1/3 cup panko or other plain bread crumbs", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil, plus basil leaves for serving", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons wine (dry white, ros\u00e9 or red), or use broth, orange juice or water", "2 cups diced ripe peaches or nectarines (about 3)", "1/4 cup thinly sliced white or red onion, or scallions", "1 lime, halved", "White rice or coconut rice, rice noodles, or crisp salad greens, for serving\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, mix together ginger, garlic, cumin and salt.
