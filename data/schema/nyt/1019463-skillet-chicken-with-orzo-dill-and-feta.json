{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken With Orzo, Dill and Feta", "description": "Chicken and orzo is timeless combination, simple and satisfying. In this recipe, you could use chicken thighs, but drumsticks make this dish super family-friendly. Of course, if you have a crowd that doesn\u2019t love the classic feta-dill pairing, feel free to change the toppings. Mint or parsley work just as well for the herbs, and any salty, crumbly cheese is lovely here. You can dress this up as you like with cucumbers or cherry tomatoes, or green olives, served alongside or pitted, chopped and tossed in instead. Besides the obvious perk of its being a one-pot dinner, this recipe yields great leftovers. For the next day\u2019s lunch, pull any remaining chicken off the bone, chop it, skin and all, and toss with the remaining orzo, vegetables and cheese. Know that the orzo \u2014 a very small pasta, not rice \u2014 soaks up all the liquid and flavor as it sits and cools, so you may need a drizzle of oil and lemon juice over the top to serve it the second day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/07/dining/sc-chicken-orzo-horizontal/merlin_143416791_00faf07e-cb79-438b-a14c-812ad8df907a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "chicken drumsticks, dill, feta, orzo, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 643}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 903, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "56 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1379 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 lemons", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "3 garlic cloves, smashed", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "2 pounds chicken drumsticks or bone-in thighs", "1 yellow onion, peeled and chopped", "2 cups orzo", "3 cups chicken broth or water", "2 small or 1 large thin-skinned (English) cucumbers, chopped", "5 ounces feta, crumbled\u00a0(about 1 1/4 cups)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill", "Castelvetrano or other green olives, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut one of the lemons into wedges and set aside.
