{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Persimmon Spice Bread", "description": "At my farmers\u2019 market one vendor was selling over-ripe fuyu persimmons for $1 a pound and I bought a few pounds just to make pur\u00e9e, which I used for dense, sweet quick breads like this one and for muffins. According to Deborah Madison, persimmons contain enzymes that will react with the flour and prevent the bread from having a nice crumb, so you must first neutralize them by stirring baking soda into the pur\u00e9e. This also causes the pur\u00e9e to become gelatinous, but the gelatinous mash is easy to break up with a whisk and will dissolve when added to the batter. Freeze any leftover pur\u00e9e.<br/><br/>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/12/science/15recipehealth/15recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 9x5-inch loaf (12 slices) ", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, flour, persimmon, spices, halal, healthy, kosher, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 85}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 217, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "249 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 ripe or over-ripe persimmons (enough for 1 cup pur\u00e9e)", "10 grams (2 teaspoons) baking soda", "140 grams (approximately 1 cup) whole wheat flour", "70 grams (approximately 1/2 cup) unbleached all-purpose flour", "75 grams  (approximately 3/4 cup) almond powder (also known as almond flour)", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "100 grams (approximately 1/2 cup) raw brown sugar or tightly packed light brown sugar", "75 grams (1/3 cup) melted unsalted butter, grape seed oil or canola oil", "1/3 cup plain low-fat yogurt or buttermilk", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup raisins", "1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees with a rack in the middle.
