{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Creamed Kale", "description": "These are not your typical creamed greens: Here, curly kale, rich coconut milk, curry powder and chile sauce are tossed together, then baked. The result is two textures in one: creamy on the bottom and crunchy (like a kale chip) on top. Crisp coconut flakes bring even more texture. Serve the greens with plenty of the curry coconut sauce spooned over. Pair them with rice, chewy noodles, roasted squash or red lentils, or alongside white fish or shrimp.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/14/dining/as-creamed-kale/merlin_166828446_33150a4f-3300-4572-89d9-db1551c5f9d9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "coconut flakes, coconut milk, curry powder, kale, sambal, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 193}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (13-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk", "2 tablespoons Madras curry powder", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated (about 1 tablespoon)", "1 teaspoon sambal oelek or Sriracha", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 large bunches curly kale (about 1 pound), stems removed, leaves torn into 3-inch pieces", "1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
