Mr. Soltner, then the chef of the celebrated Lutece in Manhattan, was explaining a controversial step in his recipe for the bird, which results in marvelously juicy, flavorful meat. When the internal temperature of the bird has come up to around 158 degrees on a meat thermometer, he adds a teaspoon of water to the roasting pan, turns off the heat of the oven, and allows the chicken to steam gently for three minutes. \u201cFor the soft breast,\u201d he said. Thyme, tarragon and onion, along with a shower of salt and pepper and just a little butter, do the rest of the work. Amazingly, perhaps, the skin stays crisp. It\u2019s a method well worth trying.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/dining/roastchicken/roastchicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "At least two servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts, times classics", "keywords": "chicken, onion, tarragon, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 404}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 661, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "1031 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 sprigs fresh thyme", "3 sprigs fresh tarragon, removing and reserving the leaves of 1 sprig", "2 small white onions, halved", "1 poussin or small chicken (about 20 ounces)", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons peanut oil", "2 sprigs fresh parsley", "1/4 cup white wine", "1/4 cup chicken broth", "2 tablespoons minced Italian parsley", "1 tablespoon butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
