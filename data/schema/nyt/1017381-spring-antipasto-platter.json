{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Antipasto Platter", "description": "The antipasto table in old-fashioned Italian restaurants is a sort of precursor to the modern-day salad bar, though usually far better. The idea is to let customers serve themselves (or be served by the ma\u00eetre d\u2019) a few spoonsful of room temperature vegetable preparations\u2014grilled eggplant, roasted peppers, marinated mushrooms\u2014along with a little cheese and salumi. It\u2019s an easy concept to adopt at home for a dinner party. Serve it buffet style, on a platter, or on individual plates as a first course. Change the vegetables seasonally; for spring use asparagus, fennel, snap peas and young onions. Choose the very freshest mozzarella, burrata or ricotta, and thinly sliced prosciutto, salame, mortadella or lardo.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/06/dining/06KITCHEN1/06KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "asparagus, fennel, fior di latte, prosciutto, sugar snap peas, main course, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 106}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 378, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "757 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 bunches small spring onions or scallions", "Salt", "1 bunch asparagus, about 1 pound, tough ends removed", "1/2 pound sugar snap peas", "2 medium fennel bulbs, trimmed and sliced crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick rings", "4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, salame, mortadella or lardo", "Flaky sea salt or fleur de sel", "Black pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Basil or mint leaves", "1 pound fior di latte, bufala mozzarella, burrata or fresh ricotta, at cool room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler.
