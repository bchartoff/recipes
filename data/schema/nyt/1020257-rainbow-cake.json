{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rainbow Cake", "description": "This Technicolor cake is a project, but one you can pull off with a little elbow grease and lots of butter (nine sticks, to be exact). Most rainbow cakes call for coloring the individual layers of cake batter, but here, the frosting is tinted, creating an impressive rainbow inside each slice. The batter uses egg whites for a light, fluffy, just-sweet-enough layer cake, while the leftover egg yolks in the frosting make it smooth and creamy. We\u2019ve included instructions for making the ombr\u00e9 and piped versions of the cake below, but you\u2019ll need to make an extra half-batch of frosting for the piped version. A standard mixer cannot accommodate more than one batch of frosting at a time, so you\u2019ll need to make the half-batch separately, then combine them before coloring and frosting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/30/dining/ejm-rainbow-cake-sliced/ejm-rainbow-cake-sliced-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, egg, flour, food coloring, milk, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 331}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "3 2/3 cups/465 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pans", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "8 large egg whites, at room temperature (reserve the egg yolks for the frosting)", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters whole milk, at room temperature", "2 1/2 cups/505 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters vegetable oil", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "2 cups/480 milliliters whole milk", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams cornstarch", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "8 large egg yolks, at room temperature", "8 sticks/905 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple food coloring paste or gel (See Tip 1)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
