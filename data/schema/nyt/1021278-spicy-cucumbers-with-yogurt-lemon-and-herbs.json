{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Cucumbers With Yogurt, Lemon and Herbs", "description": "This recipe brings together two contrasting components to create a bright summer dish. A simple yogurt sauce is dressed up with herbs and zest, then topped with cucumbers that have marinated in a spicy oil. Coriander, cumin and red-pepper flakes bloom in a neutral oil, and the cucumbers take on the flavors as they sit. For the yogurt, a variety of garden fresh herbs work well, but dill and mint are crucial. Both the yogurt and the cucumbers can be prepared up to a day in advance and kept refrigerated until serving. When you\u2019re ready, spread the yogurt sauce in a wide bowl or plate. Spoon the cucumbers on top evenly so each each bite gets\u00a0a little yogurt and\u00a0a little cucumber: One will temper the spiciness of the other. Save a handful of the herbs for a fresh garnish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/13/dining/yk-spicy-cucumbers-with-yogurt/merlin_174810651_820d2c5b-7a5e-4fe4-ba44-01cec86879c5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "cucumber, dill, mint, parsley, yogurt, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1626}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds Persian cucumbers\u00a0(about 8), ends trimmed and quartered lengthwise into spears, then crosswise into 2-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 cup grapeseed oil or other neutral oil, such as canola, safflower, sunflower oil", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar", "1 cup full-fat Greek yogurt", "1/2 cup mint leaves, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup dill, chopped", "1/4 cup parsley leaves and tender stems, chopped", "1 lemon", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Black pepper", "1/4 cup pine nuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss the cucumber pieces with 1 teaspoon salt and set in a colander in the sink to drain."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small pot, heat the oil over medium heat.
