{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Curry Glazed Tofu", "description": "To make crispy, flavorful tofu without having to press it first, use this smart method from Andrea Nguyen, the author of \u201cAsian Tofu\u201d (Ten Speed Press, 2012) and other cookbooks: Warm the tofu in a pan with a small amount of flavorful sauce. As it cooks, it will dry out and absorb the flavors of the sauce. Next, you add oil to the pan, which crisps the tofu. In Ms. Nguyen\u2019s recipe, soy sauce is used, but here, the aromatics in Thai green curry paste and the sugars in coconut milk toast and caramelize on the tofu. Once the tofu has a deep-brown crust, remove it, sear a quick-cooking vegetable in the same pan, then reduce the remaining curry-coconut mixture into a fragrant, sweet-and-spicy glaze.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/02/dining/as-green-curry-glazed-tofu/merlin_207624033_0edca327-25ea-4f92-abf2-c4fd8890f6ac-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, curries, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "coconut milk, rice, tofu, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1946}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14- to 16-ounce) block extra-firm tofu", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 (14-ounce) can full-fat, unsweetened coconut milk", "3 to 4 tablespoons Thai green curry paste", "1 tablespoon neutral or coconut oil, plus more as needed", "2 cups chopped vegetables, such as snap or snow peas, asparagus, broccoli, kale, fennel or corn kernels or a combination (see Tip)", "2 tablespoons lime juice (from 1 lime)", "Cooked rice or another grain, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the tofu in half lengthwise, then slice crosswise into 6 sections.
