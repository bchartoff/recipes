{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetable Tabbouleh With Chickpeas", "description": "This vegetable-packed salad requires no cooking, other than boiling water to soak the bulgur wheat. Sweet tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers and crisp asparagus provide texture, while creamy chickpeas add heft. A tangy shallot-lemon vinaigrette brightens the dish and soaks into the bulgur as it sits, developing more flavor over time. The salad can be made a few hours ahead; for best results, toss the salad with half of the dressing and reserve the remaining half. When ready to serve, toss with the reserved dressing to freshen it up. It\u2019s a satisfying vegetarian main, a great side for roasted meats and fish, or an easy make-ahead picnic dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/21/dining/kc-tabbouleh/kc-tabbouleh-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings (about 12 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, bulgur, bulgur wheat, cucumber, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 422}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups medium bulgur wheat", "Boiling water, as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons minced shallot", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1/4 teaspoon grated garlic", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced", "8 ounces asparagus, trimmed and sliced on the diagonal 1/8-inch-thick", "8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed", "4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/4-inch cubes (optional)", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine bulgur wheat with enough boiling water to cover by 1 inch.
