{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Scaloppine With Lemon", "description": "In order to make this chicken scaloppine, you'll first make a paillard, which just means you'll flatten the thighs by pounding them with a meat pounder, a wine bottle or the bottom of a heavy skillet. That broadens the surface area of the meat, which in turn browns and becomes crisp during cooking. It's delightful with this simple and bright lemon and white wine sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/Chicken-Scaloppine-al-Limone/Chicken-Scaloppine-al-Limone-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday", "keywords": "bread crumbs, chicken thigh, lemon juice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 424}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 287, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "273 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken thighs", "Salt", "Black pepper", "1 cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed", "1 1/2 cups fresh bread crumbs, or more as needed", "3 eggs", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "3 tablespoons butter, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "1/2 cup chicken or vegetable stock", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish", "Lemon wedges for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 200 degrees.
