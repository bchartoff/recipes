Along with the B-vitamins and minerals that all mushrooms contain, the shiitake contains all 8 amino acids, unusual for a plant, and the essential fatty acid linoleic acid, as well as an immune-boosting chemical component called lentinan. When you pan-cook them over high heat, as you do here, the flavor is very intense, because of the natural msg that all mushrooms contain.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/10/29/health/nutrition/29recipehealth.ready/29recipehealth.ready-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 161, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "250 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 small garlic clove, finely minced or pureed in a mortar and pestle", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil (can substitute some yogurt or buttermilk for some of the olive oil for a low-fat dressing)", "6 large or 8 smaller fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced (discard the stems or use for stock)", "1 teaspoon canola oil", "Salt to taste", "1 6- or 7-ounce package baby spinach, rinsed and dried", "1 celery stalk, preferably from the inner heart of the celery, sliced very thin", "1 to 2 tablespoons pine nuts or broken walnut pieces, lightly toasted", "1 ounce crumbled goat cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix together the vinegar and lemon juice with the garlic, salt, pepper, and Dijon mustard using a fork or a small whisk.
