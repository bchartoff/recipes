{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butternut Squash Polenta With Sausage and Onion", "description": "In this savory, satisfying dinner, finely ground polenta and grated butternut squash are cooked together in one pot, the squash adding sweetness to the savory cornmeal. Then browned sausages and onions seasoned with rosemary and fennel seeds are spooned on top to round out the meal. It\u2019s a dish simple enough for a weeknight, but the butternut squash makes it interesting enough to serve to guests.<br /><br />If you can\u2019t find finely ground polenta, you can substitute coarse; just add another cup of water and plan on cooking the mixture for an extra 10 to 15 minutes. You could also substitute coarsely ground cornmeal for the fine polenta. Try to avoid using instant (or quick-cooking) polenta, but if it's all you can find, add the squash, salt and bay leaf to the boiling water 15 minutes before stirring in the polenta, so the squash gets a chance to soften. Just do not use the prepared polenta that comes in a tube. You can grate the squash the day before and store it in a plastic bag in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/05APPE_SPAN/05APPE_SPAN-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, polenta, sausage, squash", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 738}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 773, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "55 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "1266 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1 bay leaf", "1 cup fine polenta (not quick cooking)", "5 ounces seeded and peeled butternut squash, coarsely grated (1 cup)", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Black pepper, as needed", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1 1/2 pounds sweet or hot Italian pork sausage, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds", "2 teaspoons minced rosemary ", "1 teaspoon fennel seeds (optional)", "2 small onions, peeled, halved, and sliced into 1/4-inch half moons", "Rosemary sprigs, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot over medium-high heat, combine 4 1/2 cups water, the salt and the bay leaf.
