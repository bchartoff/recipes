{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggplant and Zucchini Pasta With Feta and Dill", "description": "This simple yet hearty weeknight pasta is packed with two whole pounds of vegetables. Meaty eggplant makes this vegetarian meal satisfying, while zucchini adds texture and a touch of natural sweetness. Since eggplant tends to absorb oil like a sponge, the key here is to saut\u00e9 it slowly in a nonstick skillet until it softens and caramelizes without adding too much oil. The feta does double duty, adding bright tang to the dish and creating a creamy sauce. Fragrant dill is a natural pairing for eggplant and zucchini, but fresh parsley or basil would also be great.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/30/dining/kc-eggplant-zucchini-pasta/kc-eggplant-zucchini-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, pastas, vegetables", "keywords": "dill, eggplant, feta, rigatoni, summer squash, zucchini, fall, summer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 312}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound eggplant (about 2 small eggplants), cut into 1-inch cubes (about 7 cups)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound green zucchini or yellow squash, halved lengthwise and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick half-moons (about 5 cups)", "1 pound mezze rigatoni or any short pasta", "8 ounces crumbled feta (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh dill"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
