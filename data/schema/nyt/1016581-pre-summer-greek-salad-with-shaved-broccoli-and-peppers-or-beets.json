{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pre-Summer Greek Salad With Shaved Broccoli and Peppers or Beets", "description": "Classic Greek salad is a summer dish in my house; impossible to make if tomatoes are not in season and wonderful. But other vegetables take to the same treatment \u2013 a simple dressing with a high ratio of acid (in this case a combination of lemon juice and vinegar with olive oil), feta cheese and lots of mint and parsley. \n\nI don\u2019t normally use uncooked broccoli flowers. But in this case, I slice the florets paper-thin, allowing the flower buds to crumble off when I cut the crowns. Cut like this the broccoli yields to the dressing and maintains its brightness for a much longer time than cooked broccoli does. I\u2019ve made this salad combining broccoli with sweet red pepper and combining it with roasted Chioggia beets (yellow beets also work; red ones, however, bleed into the broccoli). I like both versions equally.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/17/science/19recipehealth/19recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "greek, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 63}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 162, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "280 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small red onion, cut in half lengthwise, then thinly sliced across the grain", "3 good size broccoli stalks (usually 1 bunch; stems and crowns)", "1 red bell pepper, cut in thin 2-inch slices, or 2 medium or 4 small beets, roasted, halved and sliced in thin half-moons", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 ounces feta, crumbled (about 1/2 cup)", "2 tablespoons slivered flat-leaf parsley leaves", "2 tablespoons slivered fresh mint leaves", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place onion in a bowl and cover with cold water.
