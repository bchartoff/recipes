{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Colorful Chicory Salad With Anchovy Dressing", "description": "The Italian chicory called radicchio comes in many guises. The round-headed radicchio di Chioggia is the most commonly known here, but the others, like the elongated Treviso and the curly fingered Tardivo are increasingly available. They sport shades of red, from burgundy to crimson to oxblood. The chicory family is a large one, though, and other members come in other colors, such as the fetchingly speckled yellow-cast Castelfranco; pale green broad-leafed escarole; curly endive or pointy-leaved Belgian endives, which are ivory or pink. All feature a pleasantly bittersweet flavor and require a somewhat assertive vinaigrette.\u00a0Use only one type of chicory if you wish, but a colorful mixture of many kinds is a sight to behold.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/03/dining/03KITCHEN1/03KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, endive, radicchio", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 155, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "343 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound mixed chicory leaves, such as radicchio, Castelfranco or Belgian endives, trimmed and washed", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "4 anchovy fillets, chopped", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Croutons, for garnish", "Grated pecorino or Parmesan, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Tear radicchio or Castelfranco leaves into rough 2-inch pieces; slice any other chicories into 2-inch-wide ribbons.
