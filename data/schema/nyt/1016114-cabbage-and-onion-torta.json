{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cabbage and Onion Torta", "description": "The easiest way to get everyone to love cabbage is to encase it in flaky pastry and bake until golden. This torta, filled with browned onions, silky cabbage, and plenty of creamy fontina cheese, might just be the best way you've ever eaten what is arguably a challenging vegetable. It's at its most appealing served warm, with the cheese still a little gooey. But when fully cooled it becomes picnic or lunchbox fare, sturdy enough to slice up and carry with you. The smoked ham is purely optional, but is does add a pleasing porky flavor to the mix. And if you can't find fontina, try Gruyere, Swiss or muenster instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/12/dining/12APPE1_SPAN/12APPE1_SPAN-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "cabbage, cheese, onion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 186}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 672, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "689 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["475 grams all-purpose flour (4 cups)", "60 grams whole wheat flour (1/2 cup)", "12 grams kosher salt (about 2 1/2 teaspoons), more as needed", "12 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cubed", "1/4 cup olive oil, more as needed", "1 large Spanish onion, halved and sliced (2 1/2 cups)", "1 1/2 pounds Savoy or regular cabbage (1 small head), cored and sliced", "Black pepper, as needed", "2 teaspoons cider vinegar, or to taste", "1/3 cup dry bread crumbs", "5 large garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 1/2 tablespoons thyme leaves ", "8 ounces fontina cheese, grated (2 cups)", "2 ounces diced smoked ham such as speck (optional)", "1 large egg yolk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the pastry, combine flours and 7 grams (1 1/2 teaspoons) salt in a large bowl.
