{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whiskey-Glazed Salmon With Salt-Crusted Potatoes", "description": "The savory snap of baby potatoes crusted in salt is just what you want with the subtle sweetness of this fish\u2019s glaze. The fish and the potatoes cook and come together at the same time in this fast meal. To achieve silky salmon without turning on the oven, gently cook it in a shallow pool of sauce that thickens to a syrup as it simmers. The potatoes, prepared using a technique from the Canary Islands, simply boil in generously salted water, then finish cooking with a splash of the liquid. When it evaporates, the salt that remains crusts onto the spuds. Shaking the pan vigorously helps the salt coat the potatoes evenly and sheds excess crystals. Serve with a salad or, after the glaze is scraped onto the fish, throw baby spinach into the still-hot skillet and stir to just wilt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/16/dining/11Korex/merlin_201183663_f2ebb9d7-e82b-4a0f-90e1-484ea8688c4b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "potato, salmon fillet, salt, whiskey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1056}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds baby gold potatoes, scrubbed", "2 tablespoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "6 tablespoons whiskey", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "4 (5-ounce) salmon fillets", "Salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the potatoes: The potatoes should all be the same small size, about 1 inch in diameter, so cut any larger ones in halves or quarters.
