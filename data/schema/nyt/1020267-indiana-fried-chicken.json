{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Indiana Fried Chicken", "description": "This superb style of fried chicken, found in southeastern Indiana, relies on a heavy use of black pepper. Wagner\u2019s Village Inn, a bar and restaurant in Oldenburg, stays true to the old-school method of skillet-frying in lard, and makes some of the best fried chicken in the area. The use of lard results in a very rich flavor, but canola oil is an acceptable substitute. At Wagner\u2019s, the cooks add two tablespoons of water to the skillet just before removing the fried chicken, believing it \u201cseals in the flavor.\u201d Maybe, maybe not, but it\u2019s a festive finish to this exquisitely simple dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michael Ruhlman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/19/dining/18chicken1/18chicken1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, lard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 94}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 4-pound chicken", "1 tablespoon fine table salt, plus more to taste", "2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper", "3 to 4 cups lard or canola oil", "3 cups flour, for dredging", "4 tablespoons water, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the legs from the chicken at the joint.

When the water has cooked off and the vigorous bubbling has subsided, transfer the chicken to a paper-towel-lined plate.
