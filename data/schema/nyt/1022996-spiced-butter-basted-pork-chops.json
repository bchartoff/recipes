{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Butter-Basted Pork Chops", "description": "These pork chops are juicy inside, crusty outside and draped in a smoky butter sauce, but they won\u2019t set off your fire alarm. They\u2019re cooked low and slow with a few key ingredients. First, thick chops are coated with salt and sugar, which promotes browning, then they\u2019re cooked over moderate heat. Smoked paprika and fennel seeds season the butter that\u2019s added, but feel free to swap in dried herbs or other ground or whole spices. Basting the chops with this infused butter creates a rich crust quickly so that the interior stays tender. The key is to watch the temperature of your skillet: Lower the heat if things are moving along too quickly, and the chops will achieve what you\u2019re after in time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/23/dining/as-spiced-buttered-pork-chops-3/merlin_199582629_33da8b2a-3b5a-461d-867b-f4cdb2b0dd85-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 195}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (1- to 1\u00bd-inch-thick) bone-in pork rib chops (10 to 12 ounces each)", "2 teaspoons light brown sugar", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 tablespoon neutral oil (such as canola or grapeseed)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon fennel, cumin or coriander seeds, crushed", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the pork dry and season all over with the sugar and 1 teaspoon salt.
