{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tofu Scramble", "description": "This quick\u00a0scramble is a combination of flavors and textures that will surprise and delight tofu-lovers and doubters alike. Soy sauce, turmeric and cumin provide bold seasoning, while searing the block of tofu on both sides before breaking it up yields plenty of crispy bits as well as tender ones. You can add cooked vegetables, leafy greens, beans, cheese or nutritional yeast with the scallions in Step 4, though you may want to increase the seasoning depending on the amount of extras you add. You can also swap in hot sauce, mustard or tahini for the soy sauce and play around with spice combinations, but don\u2019t skip the splash of water \u2014 it helps the tofu soak up all the flavors. Serve with toast, tortillas, salad or breakfast potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/dining/as-tofu-scramble/merlin_154348539_7e56f903-a468-4584-851d-a97308aded59-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "beans", "keywords": "cumin, scallion, soy sauce, tofu, turmeric, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 232}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) block firm or extra-firm tofu", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce or tamari", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the block of tofu in half horizontally as you would a hamburger bun.
