Yet this dish may have you reconsidering their place in your pantry. Used sparingly, sun-dried tomatoes can impart a bold tomato-y taste that Mark Bittman argues is in some ways \u201cbetter than \u2018real\u2019 tomato flavor.\u201d In this 20-minute saut\u00e9, the intense tang of capers and tomatoes plays beautifully off the mild sweetness of shrimp. Serve it over pasta or rice, or alone with a big hunk of good bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05COOKING-SHRIMPSUNDRIEDTOMATO/05COOKING-SHRIMPSUNDRIEDTOMATO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 165}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "Several sprigs thyme", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 cup\u00a0sun-dried\u00a0tomatoes, roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons capers, drained if necessary", "1/2 cup fish stock or dry white wine", "16 to 24 large\u00a0shrimp, peeled", "Salt and pepper", "Chopped fresh basil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat broiler; rack should be 2 to 4 inches from heat source and the heat as high as possible."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium heat and add thyme, garlic,\u00a0tomatoes\u00a0and capers.
