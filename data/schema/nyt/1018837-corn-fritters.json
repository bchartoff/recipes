{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn Fritters", "description": "Corn is the One True Vegetable of American summer. Vine-ripened tomatoes are thrilling, but not ours alone. And zucchini, while pleasant, does not make anyone\u2019s toes curl. But the crunch and suck of ripe local corn on the cob is, so far, confined to the Here and Now. Once you\u2019ve tired of piled-high platters of cobs, turn to corn fritters, which are always greeted with surprise \u2014 joy, even. And they are forgiving, because they can be made with fresh, or leftover cooked, kernels. Frying on a hot day isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s idea of fun, so my recipe has evolved into a hybrid of fritter and pancake, cooked in shallow oil. It goes with everything on the August table and, with maple syrup, peaches and bacon, is an ideal breakfast for dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/11/dining/11CORNFRITTERS-MAPLESYRUP/11CORNFRITTERS-MAPLESYRUP-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, pancakes", "keywords": "corn, cornmeal, main course, side dish, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 121, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "202 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ears corn, raw or cooked, husks and silk removed", "1/3 cup milk", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "Pinch cayenne", "1/4 cup cornmeal", "1/4 cup flour", "Vegetable oil, for cooking", "Maple syrup, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim off the tips of the corn cobs.
