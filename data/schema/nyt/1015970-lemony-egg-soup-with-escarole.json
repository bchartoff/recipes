{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemony Egg Soup With Escarole", "description": "This lemon-scented soup, based on a Greek avgolemono, is a warming meal in the depths of winter. Made with good chicken broth, it\u2019s familiar and comforting. But fresh lemon adds a sunny brightness while the egg and rice thicken things up, making the broth richer and heartier. To add vegetable matter, I stir some escarole into the soup, letting it wilt until silky and soft. If you like you can substitute spinach or baby kale for the escarole, adding an extra few minutes to the cooking time if using the kale.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/17/dining/recipes-lemonyeggsoup/recipes-lemonyeggsoup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, soups and stews", "keywords": "egg, escarole, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 273}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 270, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1075 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 cups chicken stock", "1/2 cup white rice ", "4 cups escarole, coarsely chopped", "3 large eggs", "2 to 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, as needed ", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest ", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, bring stock to a simmer.
