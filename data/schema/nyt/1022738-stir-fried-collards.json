Such is the case with this dish from Yung Chow, published in The Times in 2003 with an article about the history of Chinese American families who settled in the Mississippi Delta.

Amanda Hesser, who included this recipe in \u201c<a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/the-essential-new-york-times-cookbook\">The Essential New York Times Cookbook</a>,\u201d said that the wok \u201creally brings out the minerality of collards, and this goes so well with the sweetness of oyster sauce.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/10/dining/08ESSENTIALREX5-COLLARDS/merlin_196910052_52ce828c-84c4-4293-839d-ab4654e07e45-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "collard greens, garlic, oyster sauce, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 99}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 bunches tender collard greens (21/2 to 3 pounds total)", "Salt", "2 tablespoons peanut or canola oil", "6 garlic cloves, chopped", "A few grinds of black pepper", "2 to 3 tablespoons oyster sauce", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
