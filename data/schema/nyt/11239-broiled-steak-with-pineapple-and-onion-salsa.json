{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broiled Steak with Pineapple and Onion Salsa", "description": "Most modern broilers are now unfortunately equipped with thermostats, so they cycle on and off, never really getting hot enough. Start by heating your oven to its maximum temperature, typically 550 degrees; then turn on the broiler. While the oven is preheating, leave a skillet or a grill pan (a ridged skillet) inside. The best pans for this are cast-iron, enameled cast-iron, or heavy-duty steel \u2014 not stainless steel, but what chefs call \u201cblack steel.\u201d Almost needless to say, this pan must be all metal and not flimsy. Keep potholders handy. \n\nIn most cases, that skillet will stay as close to the heating element as possible, about two or three inches away. That\u2019s roughly the distance you want if you have an old-fashioned under-oven broiler, even though it will allow you to put the food closer, almost in contact with the flames. Adjustments may also be needed with a really powerful broiler, of the kind more often found in restaurants, where two or three inches may be way too close. After a little experimenting, you\u2019ll find the ideal distance for your broiler.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/28/dining/broiledsteak-still/broiledsteak-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 30}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 731, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "1129 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into thick rings (canned rings are O.K.; drain excess syrup)", "1 large onion, cut into thick slices", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon minced fresh chile, like jalapeno or Thai, or to taste, or dried red chile flakes or cayenne to taste", "2 tablespoons chopped basil or mint leaves", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 12- to 16-ounce sirloin strip or ribeye steaks, preferably at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start broiler; set rack about 4 inches from heat source.
