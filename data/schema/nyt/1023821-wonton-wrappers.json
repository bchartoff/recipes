{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wonton Wrappers", "description": "Hong Kong-style wonton wrappers are distinguished by their small square shape, thinness and the addition of eggs to a flour-based dough. The eggs yield a richer, more supple dough, which helps it roll into nearly paper-thin sheets. After they\u2019re wrapped into wontons and cooked, they taste like a delicate noodle, allowing the flavors of the filling shine. Premade wrappers are sold in the refrigerated section of Chinese and other markets, and those options work great. But if they\u2019re not available nearby, they can be made at home with basic pantry ingredients. A pasta machine makes it easy to roll the dough, but rolling by hand works, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/18/multimedia/13korex2-wrappers-zbwt/12korex2-wrappers-zbwt-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 58 (3-inch) wrappers", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, dough, egg, lunar new year, make-ahead, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/260 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons warm water", "Cornstarch, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix the flour and salt on a clean work surface or in a large bowl using chopsticks or a fork.

In both cases, the dough shouldn\u2019t be at all sticky, but if it is, very lightly dust it with cornstarch.
