{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sticky Toffee Pudding", "description": "Simon Hopkinson is a first-rate pleaser, a chef who was never after recognition but one who wanted to produce terrific food his customers would love. He\u2019s best known as the founding chef of Bibendum, the London restaurant started by Terence Conran in 1987 and recognized as one of the restaurants that marked the end of that city\u2019s postwar cooking slump.\n\nHis perfect (and not difficult) sticky toffee pudding is a dessert that according to Hopkinson first appeared on menus in Britain in the late 1960s but in fact has its origins in Canada. Whatever: it\u2019s insanely delicious. And it will please you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/21/dining/21COOKING-TOFFEE-PUDDING2/21COOKING-TOFFEE-PUDDING12-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "brown sugar, butter, dates, dessert, fall, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 539}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dates, pitted and chopped", "1 cup boiling water", "3 tablespoons butter; cold, unsalted, cubed (plus more for greasing)", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/3 cup plus 1 teaspoon Demerara sugar", "1/3 cup plus 1 teaspoon dark brown sugar", "2 eggs", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "5 tablespoons butter", "1 cup cream", "6 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 tablespoons butter", "1 1/4 cup cream, plus more for serving, if you like", "3 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the dates in a bowl and cover with the 1 cup\nboiling water to soften, at least 5 minutes.\nHeat the oven to 350 and grease a deep\n9-by-13-inch baking dish."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the 3 tablespoons butter,\nbaking soda, a pinch of salt, Demerara\nsugar, 1/3 cup plus 1 teaspoon dark brown\nsugar, eggs, flour and vanilla extract\nin a food processor and pulse until just\ncombined.
