{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemony Pea and Spinach Soup", "description": "This verdant soup has nuance: Celery, leeks and vermouth provide grassy notes, just subtle enough so as not to obscure the delicate flavor of the peas. Bright and sunny \u2014 and hearty and comforting with the optional addition of pasta \u2014 it tastes like spring, but can be prepared perennially. Unlike many one-note blended pea soups, this one celebrates textures and flavors: Divide your soup across several bowls, then add a spoonful of pasta and a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche for bright tanginess. Because this light soup is vegetable-based, drizzle it with plenty of olive oil, for richness, and pile on as many fresh herbs as you can. Lemon zest is a garnish, but nonnegotiable for this dish to sparkle.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/21/dining/aw-pea-soup/merlin_186703233_a6076400-31d9-46ba-8bd6-1b36d1b076d2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "celery, leek, parsley, pasta, peas, spinach, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 339}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "2 medium leeks (about 1 pound), trimmed, white and green portions halved lengthwise, then thinly sliced and rinsed (about 4 packed cups)", "2 celery stalks, trimmed and thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup vermouth or white wine", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "5 cups chicken stock", "16 ounces frozen peas (about 3 3/4 cups) (see Tip)", "5 ounces fresh baby spinach (about 5 packed cups)", "1/2 packed cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves and tender stems, plus more for serving", "1 to 1 1/2 cups small shaped pasta, such as ditali or shells (optional), cooked (about 2 to 3 cups)", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving", "Chopped chives and torn fresh dill, for serving", "1 lemon, for zesting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat 1/4 cup oil over medium.
