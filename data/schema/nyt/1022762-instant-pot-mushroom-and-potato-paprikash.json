Here, it\u2019s used to make quick work of this comforting, cold-weather stew, a vegetarian adaptation of the classic Hungarian dish <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018068-chicken-paprikash\">chicken paprikash</a>. This version is not at all traditional, though it has mushrooms, which are common in Hungarian cooking. Avoid washing your mushrooms, which makes them less likely to sear. Instead, wipe off any dirt with a damp cloth. Meaty trumpet mushrooms add a wonderful texture to the stew, but you can use any mushrooms you like, including all-purpose creminis.
