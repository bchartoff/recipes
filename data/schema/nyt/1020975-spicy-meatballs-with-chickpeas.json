(Feel free to use ground beef, pork or turkey if ground lamb isn\u2019t available.) They may be prepared several hours or up to 2 days in advance \u2014 they reheat beautifully. Make the tomato gravy as piquant as you like, adding a good pinch of cayenne if you wish. The optional saffron adds a floral note. If you have the time, cook your chickpeas from scratch (it\u2019s best to soak them for at least a few hours or overnight). They\u2019ll cook in less than an hour.
