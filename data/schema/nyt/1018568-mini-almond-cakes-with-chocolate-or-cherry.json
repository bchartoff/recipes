{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mini Almond Cakes With Chocolate or Cherry", "description": "These moist, rich almond cakes are miniature versions of a classic flourless almond torte, embellished here with either chocolate ganache or cherry jam. The bittersweet chocolate filling is a bit more sophisticated, while the cherry jam is sweetly crowd-pleasing. Or you can split the difference and make six of each. These gluten-free treats are best eaten within eight hours of baking so plan to make them the same day as serving. You can use either natural or blanched almond flour; the blanched will give you a slightly more delicate texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/08/dining/08APPE2/08APPE2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "12 cupcakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "almond flour, bittersweet chocolate, cherry jam, cream, dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 407}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 153, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "94 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/80 milliliters heavy cream (optional)", "3 ounces/85 grams bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped (optional)", "6 tablespoons/85 grams melted unsalted butter, cooled, plus more for muffin tin", "3/4 cup/85 grams almond flour or meal", "3/4 cup/94 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 large eggs", "Few drops almond extract (optional)", "3 tablespoons/24 grams cornstarch", "1 1/4 teaspoons/4 grams baking powder", "2 large egg whites", "2 tablespoons/25 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters cherry jam (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chocolate ganache, if using: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat cream until bubbling (or place the cream in a glass measuring cup and heat it in the microwave).
