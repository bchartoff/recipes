{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Matar Kachori (Fried Pea-Filled Pastries)", "description": "Kachori started as street food in Rajasthan, where Marwari cooks sealed food in pastry and deep-fried it, making it ideal for the hungry traders doing business at outdoor markets. Kachori can be filled with potatoes, dal and vegetables, but when peas are in season, they make what I consider the pinnacle of the genre. The filling is fresh, green, bright, juicy and lightly seasoned with herbs and lemon, all tucked inside a thin, flaky crust. The dough behaves nothing like pie dough, but somehow achieves the same effect after it\u2019s deep-fried. Though the snack was originally made to be portable and to keep for a long time, these kachori are best the day they\u2019re made.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/tr-matar-kachori/merlin_169211880_0f3ba5b6-876a-44fc-83e4-4cd588b7536b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 20 kachori", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, pastries, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, flour, ghee, ginger, lemon, peas, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/510 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons ghee, plus more for shaping the dough", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "About 10 cups neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed, for frying", "Kosher salt", "1/2 pound fresh or frozen peas (about 1 3/4 cups)", "2 teaspoons neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed", "1/4 teaspoon black mustard seeds", "1/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 (1/2-inch) piece fresh ginger, finely chopped (about 2 teaspoons)", "1 green finger chile (or serrano chile), finely chopped", "1 garlic clove, finely chopped", "2 scallions, trimmed and sliced", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 lemon, for squeezing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, combine the flour, 2/3 cup ghee and salt.

Twist and pull the edges together to close them, pinching off all the excess dough at the same time. (Try not to rip the dough, or oil will get inside the kachori when you fry it. If you do make a tear, repair it and move on!)

Repeat with remaining dough, shaping the next batch of kachori as the first is frying and leaving the remaining dough covered in plastic wrap until you\u2019re ready to form it. (If you\u2019ve been pinching excess dough, you can squeeze an extra kachori or two out of the scraps.) Serve warm."}]}
