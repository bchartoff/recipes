{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quick-Pickled Okra", "description": "Quartering the okra significantly cuts down pickling time in this recipe: The vegetable pickles more quickly because its insides are exposed. Most picklers have their own special way of seasoning the love-it or leave-it vegetable. \u201cPickled okra had to grow on me,\u201d Kenneth Garrett, a lifelong New Orleans resident and avid pickler, said. Now, he eagerly awaits okra\u2019s growing season, and he makes pickled okra with basil and oregano, all from his garden. He serves it alongside fried chicken or as a snack. Mr. Garrett adds Creole seasoning, but this recipe uses whole peppercorns instead. Feel free to be creative with spices here. This recipe is ready in hours, but you can minimize okra\u2019s characteristic gooeyness by refrigerating the pickles for two weeks before enjoying. Lastly, whenever preserving or canning, even for a \u201cquick\u201d job like this, it\u2019s important to maintain a sterile environment.
