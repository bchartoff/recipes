{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beet and Tomato Salad With Scallions and Dill", "description": "A little bistro in Normandy, France, inspired this salad that\u2019s so satisfying in its simplicity. Bright and fresh, the beets and tomatoes are dressed in a tart vinaigrette and served side by side, rather than mixed together. Though the combination may seem unusual, it\u2019s delicious. For the best flavor, choose ripe tomatoes and cook your own beets (don\u2019t be tempted to use the precooked vacuum packed type). Feel free to cook the beets and day or two in advance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/14/dining/09tanisrex1-beets/merlin_178081608_1b147378-18e1-47a9-8149-6304d8aec478-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "beet, dijon mustard, dill, scallion, tomato, fall, summer, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 186}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound golden beets (about 4 medium)", "1 pound ruby red beets (about 4 medium)", "1 pound ripe red or yellow tomatoes (about 3 medium)", "3 or 4 scallions, white and green parts, sliced crosswise", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped dill", "Handful of arugula or watercress, for garnish (optional)", "3 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the beets: Heat oven to 400 degrees.
