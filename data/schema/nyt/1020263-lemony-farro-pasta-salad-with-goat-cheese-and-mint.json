{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemony Farro Pasta Salad With Goat Cheese and Mint", "description": "Combining rice-shaped orzo with chewy farro makes for a very satisfying pasta salad, with diverse textures and a nutty flavor. Even better, you can cook the farro and orzo in the same pot, and they can be dressed up to a day in advance. Use this basic recipe as a template for your own combinations. Here, a mix of creamy goat cheese, sweet dried apricots and sliced almonds are tossed with fresh herbs and a mildly spicy lemon dressing. But add what you have and what you love; the orzo and farro can take it, with grace. You can dress the orzo and farro mixture up to one day ahead, but don\u2019t add the remaining ingredients until just before serving. The recipe feeds a crowd, so if you\u2019re not making it for a party, consider halving everything, or plan on eating leftovers for lunch all week long.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/12/dining/07apperex1/07apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "10 to 14 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, pastas, salads and dressings", "keywords": "apricot, farro, goat cheese, mint, orzo, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 422}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 cup farro", "2 bay leaves", "1 pound orzo", "3/4 cup diced dried apricots", "3/4 cup thinly sliced red onion", "3/4 cup thinly sliced celery", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "3/4 cup sliced almonds", "2 cups baby spinach leaves (2 ounces)", "1 cup crumbled fresh goat cheese (4 ounces)", "1/2 cup torn mint leaves", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped parsley leaves", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 large lemons", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste", "2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil.
