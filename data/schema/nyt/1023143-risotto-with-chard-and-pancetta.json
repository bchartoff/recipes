{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Risotto With Chard and Pancetta", "description": "This satiny risotto uses an entire bunch of chard, both stems and leaves, which gives texture and color to the tender grains of rice. Pancetta, crisped up in the pan, adds a savory, brawny crunch that contrasts with the sweetness of the shallots or onion. Red chard turns the rice a subtle shade of pink, but Swiss or rainbow chard will work equally well. And don\u2019t neglect that squeeze of fresh lemon juice right at the end; it brightens everything up.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/22/dining/22appetite-risotto1/merlin_205535643_7f0fa279-174e-4556-966f-2103e3dc3b0f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "arborio or carnaroli rice, chard, pancetta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 186}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces pancetta or unsmoked bacon, diced", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup chopped shallots or red onion", "1 (8-ounce) bunch Swiss chard, preferably red Swiss chard, stems thinly sliced and leaves coarsely chopped", "3 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 1/2 cups Carnaroli, Vialone Nano or arborio rice", "1 teaspoon fine sea or table salt, plus more to taste", "3/4 cup dry white wine", "1 quart chicken or vegetable broth, at room temperature (cold broth slows down the cooking)", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (save lemon, cut into wedges, for serving)", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine pancetta and oil in a large skillet and turn the heat to medium.
