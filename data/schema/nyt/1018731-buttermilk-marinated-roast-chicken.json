{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttermilk-Marinated Roast Chicken", "description": "This recipe, adapted from Samin Nosrat's \"Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\" is inspired by the Southern grandma method of marinating chicken overnight in buttermilk before frying it. You're roasting here, but the buttermilk and salt still work like a brine, tenderizing the meat on multiple levels to yield an unbelievably juicy chicken. As an added bonus, the sugars in the buttermilk will caramelize, contributing to an exquisitely browned skin. Be sure to leave 24 hours for marinating the chicken. While the beauty of roast chicken is that you can serve it anytime, anywhere, try serving it alongside panzanella, which plays the role of starch, salad and sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/dining/buttermilk-marinated-roast-chicken-horizontal/buttermilk-marinated-roast-chicken-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT13H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "buttermilk, chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1769}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 671, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "58 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1274 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 chicken, 3 1/2 to 4 pounds", "Kosher salt or fine sea salt", "2 cups buttermilk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before you want to cook the chicken, remove the wingtips by cutting through the first wing joint with poultry shears or a sharp knife.
