{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Steak Marinade", "description": "Soy, coriander and cumin join ginger and garlic in this simple, umami-laden marinade. It\u2019s a perfect match for any tender cut of beef, such as bavette, rib-eye or flank steak which have a loose, visible grain primed for soaking up marinades. This recipe imparts its flavor in as little as 30 minutes, though the meat benefits from any additional marinating time \u2014 and can sit for up to two days. The steak chars as it cooks, and the exterior caramelizes to create a crisp, powerfully savory crust.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lara Lee"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/29/dining/ll-steak-marinade/ll-steak-marinade-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "ginger, rice vinegar, soy sauce, steak", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 753}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce", "3 tablespoons rice vinegar", "2 tablespoons sesame oil", "1 (1 1/4-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated (about 2 teaspoons)", "3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated (about 2 teaspoons)", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 1/2 pounds boneless steak, any tender cut (preferably bavette, sirloin tip, flap, rib-eye, flank or sirloin)", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, for cooking (if using a pan)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, coriander and cumin in a large bowl or resealable freezer bag.
