You can make your own rusks by drying out thick slices of whole grain bread in the oven. It\u2019s a good way of preserving bread before it goes stale or moldy, but it does take about eight hours. For a quicker version, toast thick pieces of bread \u2014 or just look for rusks in a local Greek market.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/26/health/26recipehealth_600/26recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, healthy, vegetarian, summer, tomato, whole-grain country bread", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 112}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 175, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "205 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 thick slices whole-grain country bread", "1/4 cup finely chopped red onion", "1 pound ripe, locally grown tomatoes", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon capers, rinsed", "1 garlic clove, minced or pur\u00e9ed", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill or parsley", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 to 2 ounces feta, crumbled (optional)", "2 teaspoons dried oregano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toast the bread and set aside, or dry it in a very low oven (a pilot light provides sufficient heat, if you have one) for 8 to 10 hours.
