{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fish With Citrus-Chile Sauce", "description": "This light yet earthy sauce lends a generous, almost floral warmth to any white, sturdy fish. For heat, there are crushed Calabrian chiles, smoky and sunny; for a mellow sourness, Moscatel vinegar \u2014 feel free to substitute apple cider vinegar and a little sugar to approximate the same fruitiness; and for funk, fermented white pepper (although regular white pepper will work too). Other notes include delicate marjoram, cousin to oregano but less forward, with its comforting contour of balsam, and Timur pepper from Nepal, fragrant and bright, calling to mind a just-peeled tangerine. (If you use Sichuan pepper instead, give it a citrus boost with extra orange juice and a shower of orange zest.) The sauce comes out denser than a vinaigrette but still loose and the orange-red of a young sunset.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/31/dining/31EAT-fish-with-chile-citrus-sauce/merlin_210597681_83f81251-75d7-4280-82f9-092aeea025ba-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, main course", "keywords": "Calabrian chile, marjoram, Moscatel vinegar, timur peppercorn, white peppercorns, healthy", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 143}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon Timur (Timut) peppercorns (see Tip)", "1/4 teaspoon white peppercorns, preferably fermented (see Tip)", "1 1/2 tablespoons Moscatel vinegar (see Tip)", "2 teaspoons crushed Calabrian chiles (in oil)", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh marjoram leaves, finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon orange or tangerine juice", "1 small garlic clove, minced", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt", "4 sturdy white fish fillets or steaks (about 6 ounces each), such as halibut, red snapper, sea bass or swordfish", "Salt and pepper", "Olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Toast the Timur pepper in a dry skillet over medium heat.
