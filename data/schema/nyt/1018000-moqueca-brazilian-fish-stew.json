{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Moqueca (Brazilian Fish Stew)", "description": "This Brazilian dish may contain a few unexpected or even unfamiliar ingredients, but they are easy to find online and worth the search. The result is a tropical fish stew mellowed by slices of plantain and coconut milk and accompanied by the traditional hot sauce called piri-piri and\u00a0farofa, the toasted cassava-meal accompaniment. Farofa is served all over South America with all kinds of dishes; this version, with caramelized onions adapted from Felipe Amaral in Rio de Janeiro, was my favorite. You can serve the moqueca without the farofa, if you prefer, but it helps to sop up the soupy liquid from the stew.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/16/dining/16MOQUECA/16MOQUECA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "brazilian", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "dende oil, manioc flour, octopus, plantain, sea bass, shishito peppers, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 123}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 696, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "1288 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 medium onion, sliced thin", "1 1/2 cups manioc or cassava meal, available online and in some specialty food shops", "1 3/4 pounds black sea bass, filleted, trimmings reserved", "12 ounces large shrimp, peeled, shells reserved", "Salt", "2 bay leaves", "1 small white turnip, peeled and diced", "3 medium onions", "4 large plum tomatoes", "6 ounces shishito peppers, chopped", "2 cloves garlic", "1/3 cup chopped cilantro", "1/4 cup chopped chives", "1 green plantain", "1/2 red bell pepper, cut in rings", "2 green Cubanelle peppers, green frying peppers or 1 small green bell pepper, cut in rings", "10 ounces unsweetened coconut milk", "4 tablespoons dend\u00ea oil, or red palm oil, available online", "6 ounces cooked octopus tentacles, cut in thick slices, or raw squid in thin rings", "1 long red chile pepper, for garnish", "1/2 cup long grain rice, steamed", "Piri-piri or other hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the farofa if desired: Melt butter in a skillet or shallow saucepan on medium heat.
