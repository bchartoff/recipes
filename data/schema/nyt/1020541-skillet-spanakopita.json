A combination of stovetop cooking and oven baking ensures that the filling stays moist while the crust gets crisp. First, the spinach is cooked down in a mixture of butter, garlic and leeks until it wilts enough to release any moisture. Then, the filling is prepared, and the spanakopita assembled in the skillet. Give the phyllo a head start on the stovetop, then transfer to the oven so the spinach filling cooks through at the same time the phyllo becomes flaky. The timing may be precise for the cooking, but you can eat it whenever you want: This spanakopita is just as good at room temperature as it is warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/dining/aw-skillet-spanakopita/aw-skillet-spanakopita-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "feta, leeks, phyllo, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 432}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick)", "2 medium leeks (about 1 1/2 pounds), white and pale-green parts only, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise (about 3 cups)", "6 garlic cloves, chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds fresh baby spinach", "3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves", "1/2 cup chopped fresh dill", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan", "2 teaspoons lemon zest, plus 2 teaspoons juice (from 1 large lemon)", "Pinch of ground nutmeg", "2 large eggs, beaten", "6 ounces fresh Greek sheep\u2019s-milk feta in brine, drained and crumbled (about 1 1/2 cups feta)", "8 sheets phyllo dough of any size (see Tip), thawed, laid flat on a sheet pan and loosely covered with a towel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (preferably 10-inch) cast-iron skillet, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat.
