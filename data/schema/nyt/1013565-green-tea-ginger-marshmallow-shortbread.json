In a food processor fitted with a blade, pulse together flour, sugar and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Add the butter and pulse to fine crumbs. Pulse a few more times until some crumbs start to come together, but do not overprocess. Dough should not be smooth. Press dough into an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking pan. (It won\u2019t look as if you have enough, but keep pressing and it will cover the pan in a thin layer.) Prick dough all over with a fork. Bake until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.

Continue mixing until the mixture has cooled slightly, about 2 minutes. Scrape in the gelatin mixture. Continue mixing on medium-high speed until the mixture begins to thicken and quadruples in volume, about 10 minutes. Scrape the mixture into the pan with the shortbread, smoothing the top with an offset spatula. Rub together the candied ginger and superfine sugar to break up any clumps. Sprinkle over the top of the marshmallows. Let marshmallows set for 4 hours or overnight at room temperature.
