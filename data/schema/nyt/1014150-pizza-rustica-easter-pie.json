This version came to The Times from Carlo's Bakery, in Hoboken, N.J., of \u201cCake Boss\u201d fame, and it is the only savory item the bakery makes. It's typically eaten at room temperature, but the staff at Carlo's enjoys it warm right out of the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alex Witchel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/pizzarustica/pizzarustica-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "One 10-by-15-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, pies and tarts, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "cheese, eggs, meat, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 257}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 pound chilled salted butter, cut into large pieces", "5 large eggs, beaten", "12 ounces prosciutto, in 1/4-inch dice", "8 ounces boiled ham, in 1/4-inch dice", "8 ounces pepperoni, in 1/4-inch dice", "8 ounces soppressata, in 1/4-inch dice", "8 ounces mozzarella, in 1/4-inch dice", "8 ounces provolone, in 1/4-inch dice", "2 pounds ricotta", "4 ounces grated pecorino Romano", "10 large eggs, beaten", "1 teaspoon pepper", "1 large egg, beaten, for brushing crust"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together 6 cups flour and the salt.
