{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bacon Cornbread With Cheddar and Scallions", "description": "This cornbread hits all the notes, but skews particularly salty and savory, thanks to saut\u00e9ed scallions, extra-sharp Cheddar, and bacon, folded into the batter and crowning the top of the cornbread. You can use fancy, thick-cut bacon or flimsier thin-cut varieties. Each has its benefits: Thinner bacon slices form a light, crunchy layer on the crust, while thick-cut slices have more presence in the cornbread. This cornbread belongs at brunch, where it pairs well with eggs cooked in any style, saut\u00e9ed vegetables and even breakfast sausages, but it would also be at home next to a bowl of chili. If preparing for a crowd, you can bake this off a day in advance and reheat it in the oven just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Klancy Miller"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/dining/KM-BACON-CORNBREAD/KM-BACON-CORNBREAD-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, breads", "keywords": "bacon, cheddar, cornmeal, scallion, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 17}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 589, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "724 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 slices thick-cut bacon (about 1 pound)", "1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 cups chopped scallions (from about 4 bunches)", "Kosher salt", "Butter, for greasing the pan", "1 cup medium-grind stone-ground cornmeal", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 cup whole milk", "1 egg, beaten", "1 tablespoon honey", "8 ounces extra-sharp Cheddar, grated (about 2 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
