{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Italian Sub Dinner", "description": "The Italian sub, a deli sandwich that piles some combination of cheese, cured meats and preserved vegetables onto a soft roll, is an Italian-American classic. But toss those fillings onto a sheet pan and hit them with a little heat, and they caramelize and crisp into a complete dinner with loads of character \u2014 sweet and spicy, bitter and briny. In this recipe, salami, red onions, pepperoncini, tomatoes, radicchio and chickpeas get tossed with an oregano-garlic vinaigrette before roasting. The radicchio and red onion mellow, the tomatoes sweeten and the salami releases fat and seasonings that add even more flavor and richness. (You can swap in cauliflower florets, cubes of squash or halved red potatoes for the radicchio.) Serve with a plop of ricotta for creaminess (or provolone and Parmesan, for a more traditional take), more vinaigrette and crusty bread for sopping it all up or piling it into a sandwich.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/14/dining/as-sheet-pan-italian-sub/as-sheet-pan-italian-sub-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, sandwiches, sausages, vegetables", "keywords": "chickpea, radicchio, red onion, red wine vinegar, ricotta, salami, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 451}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons dried oregano", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup red wine vinegar", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 (14-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and patted dry", "5 ounces salami (casing removed if there is one), cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 red onion, peeled, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch wedges", "1 medium head radicchio (about 3/4 pound), quartered lengthwise", "1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, halved", "8 pepperoncini peppers", "1/2 cup ricotta", "Crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
