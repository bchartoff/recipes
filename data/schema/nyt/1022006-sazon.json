{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saz\u00f3n", "description": "Cumin-heavy saz\u00f3n is among the most commonly used spice blends in Puerto Rican cooking, and is also popular throughout Latin America. This seasoning is an incredible cheat, and is typically found in the international section of most supermarkets. Commercial brands are flavor bombs pumped with monosodium glutamate \u2014 MSG \u2014 that can make almost anything taste better. While I\u2019m not MSG-phobic, I do prefer making my own blends to control both the flavor and the salt content. This is my take on saz\u00f3n, minus the MSG, and with turmeric added along with the standard annatto to imbue dishes with a golden hue. Adaptation is encouraged based on preference, and if you can\u2019t find ground annatto then sweet paprika is a perfect substitute. It will keep in an air-tight container for years.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/22Puertoricanrex6-sazon/merlin_184863075_2f1299e0-8033-4136-b1e3-cc2307f393c9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "About 1/2 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "annatto seeds, cumin, puerto rican, turmeric", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 304}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons ground annatto or sweet paprika", "1 tablespoon garlic powder", "1 tablespoon onion powder", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 tablespoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In an airtight container, combine all ingredients.
