{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stone-Ground Grits", "description": "Stone-ground grits are dried corn kernels that have been coarsely ground. Unlike instant and quick-cooking grits, their coarse nature requires a longer cooking time, but the resulting dish is more flavorful and, when cooked long enough, smells like popcorn. Don\u2019t skimp on the cook time, and add more water if needed. You can find white and yellow stone-ground grits at many grocery stores, or purchase them online. This recipe is for cheesy grits, though some people prefer their grits sweet and add sugar. Extra-sharp Cheddar works wonderfully here, but feel free to use a smoked Cheddar or even smoked Gouda for even more flavor.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/04/multimedia/10GRITSREX1-grits-1-8c5c/04GRITSREX1-grits-1-8c5c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, lunch, side dish", "keywords": "grits, milk, porridge, soul food, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 24}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups whole or reduced-fat milk (see Tip)", "1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 cup stone-ground grits\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground white or black pepper", "1 cup shredded extra-sharp or sharp Cheddar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 2 cups water, the milk, butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat.
