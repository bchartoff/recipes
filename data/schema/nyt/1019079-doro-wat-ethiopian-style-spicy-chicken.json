{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Doro Wat (Ethiopian-Style Spicy Chicken)", "description": "Doro wat is a popular chicken dish in Ethiopia, and for Ethiopian Jews like Meskerem Gebreyohannes, it is also a fine centerpiece for a holiday like Hanukkah. Mrs. Gebreyohannes makes her doro wat with a Berbere spice mix imported from Ethiopia, but for this recipe, it is not needed, as the spices are listed individually. Doro wat is easy to make and can be prepared ahead of time. You can lower the heat by ratcheting up the sweet paprika, rather than the cayenne.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/06/dining/06HANUKKAH-REX-SUB/06HANUKKAH-REX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "ethiopian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, ginger, onion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 298}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 523, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "59 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "573 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 to 10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "Juice of 1 lemon", "1 tablespoon white vinegar", "4 to 5 large onions, peeled and quartered", "Fresh ginger (1-inch piece), peeled and grated", "1/2 head of garlic, peeled", "1/3 cup olive oil", "1 to 2 tablespoons hot chile powder like cayenne", "1 tablespoon sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon dried thyme", "1/4 teaspoon ground fenugreek", "3/4 teaspoon salt or to taste", "Pinch of freshly ground black pepper", "Injera, pita, naan or rice, for serving", "Hard-boiled eggs, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees and rub the chicken with the lemon juice and vinegar."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the chicken in a rimmed baking sheet and bake, discarding the juices after 20 minutes, then draining again after 10 more minutes.
