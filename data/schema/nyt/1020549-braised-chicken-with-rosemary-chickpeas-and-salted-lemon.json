In this weeknight version, a broth seasoned with salted lemon, rosemary and tomatoes bathes the chicken and chickpeas, making a lovely, hearty stew. For a bold and bright finish, lemon slices quick-pickled in juice and salt are added to the stew. A handful of hearty greens, a scattering of fresh herbs and a spoon of creamy yogurt ensures every bite is rich and flavorful. Serve over steamed couscous or with thick slices of crusty bread for dipping.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/dining/yk-rosemary-chicken-with-salted-lemon-and-chickpeas/merlin_162312300_34263f89-3d23-4a52-bb0e-8e7923d30b56-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken, chickpea, greens, herb sprigs, lemon, rosemary, tomatoes, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 601}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds whole chicken legs or bone-in, skin-on thighs", "1 lemon, halved lengthwise", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 medium onion, peeled and thinly sliced", "4 garlic cloves, smashed", "1 fresh rosemary sprig", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1 (15-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed", "Black pepper", "4 cups hearty greens like spinach, kale or mustard greens, trimmed and torn", "1 cup mix of fresh herbs like dill, parsley and mint", "Full-fat Greek yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using whole chicken legs, cut the joint just enough to bend the leg, and make a deep, 2-inch-long cut on the meat without cutting all the way through."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut one half of the lemon crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick half moons.
