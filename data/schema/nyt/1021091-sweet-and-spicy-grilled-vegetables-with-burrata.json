{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet-and-Spicy Grilled Vegetables With Burrata", "description": "A colorful platter of soft, grilled vegetables in a sweet-and-spicy sauce can be the centerpiece of a light summery meal; just add some creamy cheese for richness and crusty bread to round things out. This recipe is extremely adaptable. You mix and match the vegetables, increasing the amounts of your favorites (or the ones you can get your hands on), and skipping anything you don\u2019t have. And if your grill is large enough, you can make several different kinds of vegetables at the same time. Just don\u2019t crowd them so they cook evenly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/dining/15apperex/merlin_172407834_73520f1c-e7b4-401e-a738-abd9051178a0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "asparagus, bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, corn, eggplant, honey, mozzarella, mushroom, raisin, zucchini, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1580}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup chopped raisins, preferably golden, or dried apricots", "2/3 cup white wine vinegar or cider vinegar (or a combination)", "2 tablespoons honey, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon fish sauce or colatura (optional)", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 to 3 bell peppers, quartered, stems and seeds removed", "1 to 2 zucchini or summer squash, sliced diagonally 1/2-inch thick", "1 small eggplant, sliced diagonally 1/2-inch thick", "2 to 4 ears yellow corn, shucked", "8 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and halved or quartered", "1 bunch thick asparagus, ends snapped", "8 ounces cherry tomatoes, preferably still on the vine", "2 small burrata or fresh mozzarella balls, or 2 cups fresh ricotta", "Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Basil or mint leaves, for serving", "Crusty bread slices"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Put raisins or apricots in a small heatproof bowl.
