Two things to remember: 1) A wok should not be limited to Asian stir-fries. 2) The cooking water drained off from cooked barley or brown rice can be added to cooked vegetables the way pasta cooking water is sometimes used to moisten and add texture to an accompaniment. The starch in the nutrient-dense water enriches the vegetables like a sauce. Just add more water than the usual proportion that you\u2019d use \u2013 say a quart for a cup of brown rice or barley, and drain the grains through a strainer set over a bowl when they\u2019re tender. You can cook this beautiful, lemony skillet dinner in a well-seasoned wok or a heavy nonstick pan. You\u2019ll get the best seared flavor in a wok.
