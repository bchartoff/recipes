The yogurt is thick, and pungent with mashed garlic, the cucumbers either finely chopped or grated, then salted and allowed to wilt. Walnuts enrich the Balkan version, which is also considered a soup, as is Cacik. India has its version too, raita, the cooling mixture that accompanies hot curries. Whatever the cuisine, it\u2019s one of my favorite combinations, one I never forgo if I see it on a menu.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/08/26/health/nutrition/26recipehealth.ready/26recipehealth.ready-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 370}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 89, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "266 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 European cucumber or 3 Persian cucumbers, finely chopped or grated", "Salt", "<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/health/nutrition/25recipehealth.html#recipe\">2 cups drained yogurt</a>", "2 to 3 garlic cloves, cut in half, green shoots removed, and mashed to a paste in a mortar and pestle with 1/4 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint (more to taste)", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss the cucumber with a generous amount of salt and leave in a colander in the sink to wilt for 15 to 30 minutes.
