{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Milk and Honey Pie With Cereal Crust", "description": "This pie\u2019s crunchy toasted cornflake crust and honey-sweetened pudding may inspire new pie-centric breakfast routines, especially when topped with juicy plums. Feel free to play around with nectarines or peaches, too. Because cornflakes (and other not-too-sweet cereals) don\u2019t have as much fat and sugar as packaged cookies and crackers, they need more sugar and butter to bind them into a sturdy crust. The extra butter here can sometimes cause the crust to puff or shrink while it bakes. If that happens, don\u2019t worry: gently press the crust back into place while still warm with a flat bottomed measuring cup and proceed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/28/dining/26PIESREX3/merlin_187777485_5d675faf-2753-49a1-a6fc-f207bc5d33ea-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "cornflakes, cream, honey, plum, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 342}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces/170 grams cornflakes (about 5 cups)\u00a0", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "8 tablespoons/115 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled\u00a0", "4 large egg yolks", "1 large egg", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters honey", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar\u00a0", "5 tablespoons/40 grams cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream\u00a0", "1 pound/454 grams ripe plums, pitted and sliced", "1 to 2 teaspoons honey (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees with a rack in the middle position.
