{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Guacamole", "description": "The fried guacamole that Angelo Sosa serves at Abajo, his tequila bar, reminded me of the fried ice cream served at some Chinese restaurants. It\u2019s creamy, crunchy and cool on the inside. It\u2019s easier than you might think and it makes for a nice tidbit to enjoy with a drink, or as a first course with a salad. You can prepare the guacamole and freeze it early in the day, leaving only the frying for the last minute. The fritters can also be kept warm in a 150 degree oven for at least 30 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/27/dining/27BURNERGUAC/27BURNERGUAC-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, avocado, corn flour, jalape\u00f1o, seltzer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 631, "unsaturatedFatContent": "45 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "602 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 avocadoes, pitted and peeled", "1 tablespoon minced, seeded jalape\u00f1o", "1 tablespoon minced red onion", "1 tablespoon minced cilantro", "Juice of 1 lime", "Salt", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup corn flour", "Pinch baking powder", "12 ounces seltzer", "Vegetable oil for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mash one avocado until smooth.
