{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arroz Mamposteao", "description": "Rice and beans are religion in Puerto Rico, though they\u2019re typically prepared separately but served together, several spoonfuls of beans on top of white rice. But mamposteao \u2014 easily my favorite name for a Puerto Rican dish \u2014\u00a0combines the two. It\u2019s a preparation intended to make use of leftovers, as it benefits from day-old rice and prepared beans. Traditionally, pork and tomato sauce are added \u2014 but, for a more subtle approach to this recipe, bacon fat replaces ham or tocino (fatback) here, giving the dish a smoky richness without any meat. You can prepare this dish from start to finish with fresh rice and fresh beans, but it\u2019s not recommended. Think of this as a satisfying way to make use of leftover ingredients that also pairs well with a variety of Puerto Rican dishes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/22Puertoricanrex1-arroz/merlin_184863189_7f08b966-d2c3-44c5-9370-a835056c3e34-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, beans, grains and rice, side dish", "keywords": "bacon fat, cilantro, kidney bean, puerto rican, white rice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 227}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons bacon fat or olive oil", "1/2 cup <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022007-sofrito\">sofrito</a>", "1 teaspoon store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022006-sazon\">homemade saz\u00f3n</a>", "1 1/2 cups or 1 (15-ounce) can drained, cooked beans, such as kidney, pinto or pink beans", "1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth (or liquid from beans), plus more as needed", "2 1/2 cups cooked long- or short-grain white rice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "Chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a wide skillet or wok, heat bacon fat over medium-high until just simmering.
