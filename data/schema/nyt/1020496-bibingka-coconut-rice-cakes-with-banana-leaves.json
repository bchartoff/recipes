{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bibingka (Coconut Rice Cakes With Banana Leaves)", "description": "Bibingka is a cake made of rice flour, so it\u2019s naturally gluten-free, chewy but tender throughout, with a souffl\u00e9-like fluffiness. It\u2019s traditionally cooked in a clay pot over and under hot coals, a difficult setup to replicate; instead, I pour the batter into a cast-iron pan lined with banana leaves, which char as the cake bakes, infusing it with their scent. (You can cut the ribs off the leaves to make them more malleable.) Nearly halfway through baking, the cake is topped with salted duck egg, an ingredient available at Asian specialty groceries. If you can\u2019t find it, the cake will be more forthrightly sweet, lacking that sly note of brine. As a final touch, if you have a kitchen torch available, char the edges of the banana leaves, so a little smokiness suffuses the delicate cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Angela Dimayuga"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipinorex10/merlin_161002752_06a44c57-3e21-4e1a-8e3e-14e0c664d3a5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "Two 8-inch cakes (about 16 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "banana leaf, coconut milk, cream cheese, parmesan, rice flour, salted duck egg, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 32}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large sheets frozen banana leaves (from a 1-pound package), rinsed and thawed", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "8 ounces/225 grams cream cheese, softened", "1/2 cup/30 grams finely grated Parmesan", "2 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/455 grams rice flour", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons baking powder", "2 cups/480 milliliters coconut milk", "4 eggs", "2 salted duck eggs, peeled and thinly sliced crosswise into coins (not ovals)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees and center racks."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line two 8-inch cast-iron skillets or similar pans with banana leaves: Set 2 large sheets in each pan, allowing banana leaves to overlap in the center and come up the sides.
