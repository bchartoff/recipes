{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dolester Miles\u2019 Coconut Pecan Cake", "description": "This is a rich, special-occasion cake that takes the traditional Southern coconut cake to another level, with ground toasted pecans in the batter and an easy-to-make Chantilly cream for frosting. It has become the signature dessert for Dolester Miles, who serves slices over a little puddle of cr\u00e8me anglaise at Chez Fonfon and Bottega, and sometimes at the Highlands Bar & Grill, the Birmingham, Ala., restaurants owned by Frank and Pardis Stitt. Assembly can be a challenge, so she suggests building the cake by stacking the delicate slabs of cake with filling in between each layer into a deep, round cake pan, then slipping it into the refrigerator for about an hour. The filling acts like a delicious glue. When the cake is inverted and unmolded, the edges have an even, professional appearance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/14/dining/30pastryrex2/30pastryrex2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H30M", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "birthday, kwanzaa, mother\u2019s day, coconut extract, coconut milk, cream of coconut, shredded sweetened coconut, sweetened condensed milk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1825}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 730, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "sodiumContent": "301 milligrams", "sugarContent": "62 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/85 grams firmly packed sweetened shredded coconut", "3/4 cup/74 grams pecan halves, toasted", "2 cups/402 grams granulated sugar", "2 1/4 cups/287 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened, plus more for the pans", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters cream of coconut", "4 large eggs", "1/4 teaspoon coconut extract", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/270 milliliters unsweetened coconut milk", "2 large egg yolks, lightly beaten", "3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon cream of coconut", "1 cup/85 grams sweetened shredded coconut", "1/2 cup/101 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1/4 cup/31 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 teaspoon coconut extract", "2 cups/170 grams sweetened shredded coconut, toasted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
