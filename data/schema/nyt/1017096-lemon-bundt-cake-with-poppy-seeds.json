The formula is much the same as the one I used for my walnut apricot Bundt cake modeled on Peter Reinhart\u2019s formulas for quick breads and muffins, with ricotta standing in for some of the buttermilk.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/30/science/recipehealthricotta/recipehealthricotta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H35M", "recipeYield": "1 generous ring, 20 to 24 slices", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, snack, cakes", "keywords": "dessert, fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 107}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 164, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "164 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["383 grams / about 3 cups whole wheat flour", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda", "145 grams / 5 ounces / 1 1/4 sticks unsalted butter, melted", "1/2 cup mild honey, such as clover", "3 eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/4 cups / 296 milliliters buttermilk", "6 ounces / 3/4 cup / 170 grams ricotta", "1 1/2 tablespoons lemon extract", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Grated zest of 1 to 2 lemons (to taste)", "2 tablespoons poppy seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
