{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom Stroganoff", "description": "The first recipe for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020862-beef-stroganoff\">beef stroganoff</a> dates back to the 1800s and is rumored to have Russian aristocratic origins. This version is a bold, modern vegetarian reimagination that is rich and decadent, thanks to the magic of mushrooms, which deliver walloping umami. A variety of mushrooms adds a nice mix of textures, but a similarly intense dish can be created with just one type. Achieve even deeper layers of flavor by soaking a handful of dried porcini mushrooms in one cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes, then adding the mushrooms and soaking liquid, which can replace the vegetable stock, to the dish. Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is naturally thick and imparts a velvety tang to the dish, but use sour cream if you prefer. (Vegans can use cashew or coconut cream).\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/01/dining/hm-mushroom-stroganoff/merlin_195505278_748af7fa-87c1-4ab3-a803-5714351ed482-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "dijon mustard, mushroom, soy sauce, white wine, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1164}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 yellow onion, finely diced", "Salt", "1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms (oyster, shiitake, cremini or button), stemmed and sliced into 1/4-inch pieces", "2 sprigs fresh thyme", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1/2 cup white wine", "1 cup vegetable stock", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream", "Black pepper", "Sweet paprika, for dusting", "Handful of chopped parsley leaves, for serving", "Mashed potatoes, wide egg noodles or rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large (12-inch) skillet on medium-high heat.
