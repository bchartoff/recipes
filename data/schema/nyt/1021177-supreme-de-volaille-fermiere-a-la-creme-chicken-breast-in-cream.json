(Mr. Buford worked with the chef while researching his book \u201cDirt.\u201d) If you just made a batch of chicken stock, there are few better things to do with it than poaching chicken breasts in it. You get two benefits: white meat that is about as moist and tender as possible, and stock that is stronger than when you started, particularly if you poach the entire bird and save the legs for another night. The goal is to keep the liquid well below boiling; it\u2019s a stove-top approximation of the sous vide technique.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pete Wells"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/22/dining/21Bufordrex1/merlin_173545848_0b8e6fc6-f1e2-489c-8b04-fbda3692b5f7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, chicken stock, dijon mustard, light cream, white port", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 93}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole large (4-pound) chicken, trussed, or legs tied with kitchen string", "2 quarts (8 cups) chicken stock", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 cup light cream", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "1 tablespoon white port (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set the chicken in a large, deep pot.

Using a knife, ensure that you remove the rest of the breast meat (including the filets) from the bone without tearing; remove and discard any membranes from the surface of each breast.
