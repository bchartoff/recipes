{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pickled Beets With Caraway", "description": "Caraway, great with carrots, is also very nice with beets. The trick to succeeding with these is to slice them very thin \u2013 about 1/8 inch thick. You can do this on a mandoline or with a Japanese slicer, or just use a sharp knife. The longer these are left to pickle the better. My favorite way to serve these pickled beets is to cut them into thin julienne and add them to a salad or make them into a beet slaw.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/07/science/08recipehealth/08recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "821 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups thinly sliced beets, cut in half-moons if desired", "2 teaspoons caraway seeds", "1/2 cup (135 grams) seasoned rice wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon (15 grams) sherry vinegar", "1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar", "1 cup (230 grams) water", "2 1/4 teaspoons (10 grams) kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the beets and caraway seeds in a bowl or jar."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the rice wine vinegar, sherry vinegar and sugar.
