{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Red Pepper Cranberry Relish", "description": "A kicky condiment, usually made with cranberries, can offset the neutral (read: bland) yet rich nature of the Thanksgiving meal. This hot red-pepper cranberry relish with jalape\u00f1os and cayenne fits the bill. You can keep the seasoning somewhat tame, or ramp up the heat to taste. It will keep for 2 weeks or so; make it in advance, as soon as cranberries are available, and have it on hand in the fridge through the holiday season.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/08/dining/08spicyredpeppercranberry/08spicyredpeppercranberry-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "condiments, dips and spreads, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "cranberry, jalape\u00f1o, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 457}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 237, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "293 milligrams", "sugarContent": "54 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup sugar", "2 large jalape\u00f1os, preferably red, seeded and finely diced", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "12 ounces cranberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put sugar, jalape\u00f1os, lemon juice, salt and cayenne in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat.
