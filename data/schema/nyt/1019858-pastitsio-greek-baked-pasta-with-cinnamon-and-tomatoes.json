{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pastitsio (Greek Baked Pasta With Cinnamon and Tomatoes)", "description": "This comforting Greek baked pasta, which bears a striking resemblance to lasagna, derives its name from the Italian word \u201cpasticcio.\u201d That translates to English as \u201ca mess,\u201d indicating the forgiving, flexible nature of the dish. Many traditional pastitsio recipes call for beef \u2013\u2013 which you can certainly use here \u2013\u2013 but we use ground lamb for a fresh take on a classic (and many cooks prefer a combination). Because kefalotyri cheese and the long tubular noodles traditionally used in pastitsio can't be found in most American supermarkets, we substituted Parmesan and ziti in their place, but by all means, if you can get your hands on the real things, use them. The noodles and spiced meat sauce are layered in a casserole dish then topped with a creamy b\u00e9chamel sauce and baked until golden. It\u2019s project cooking that\u2019s perfect for a cold winter\u2019s night.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/20/dining/CH-pastitsio/CH-pastitsio-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, cinnamon, ground lamb, pasta, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 64}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 809, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "1044 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium red onion, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 pounds ground lamb", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh oregano", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh thyme", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes", "2 1/2 cups whole milk", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 1/2 cups grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese", "1 pound ziti or penne pasta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a large, deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium.
