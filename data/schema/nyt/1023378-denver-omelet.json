{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Denver Omelet", "description": "The Denver omelet \u2014 a diner classic of eggs, bell peppers, onions, ham and often cheese \u2014 actually began as a sandwich made with those ingredients in the American West in the late 19th century. Its exact origins are fuzzy, but some historians think it was a modification of egg foo yong made by Chinese laborers working the transcontinental railroad, or a scramble made by pioneers masking spoiled eggs with onions. (Bell peppers were likely a later addition.) When the sandwich became popular in Utah, it was named the Denver sandwich after Denver City, Utah. By the 1950s, the Denver was one of the most popular sandwiches around, and at some point in the mid-20th century, diners swapped the sandwich bun for a knife and fork.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/01/dining/AS-Denver-Omelet/merlin_209008464_6c6c847f-3291-4224-bbfc-0acf61928b01-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, easy, for two, lunch, quick, one pot, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, ham", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 316}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large eggs", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)\u00a0", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 small green bell pepper, seeds and stem removed, finely chopped (about 3/4 cup)", "1 small yellow onion, finely chopped (about 3/4 cup)", "Black pepper", "4 ounces ham steak or Canadian bacon, coarsely chopped", "1 1/2 ounces coarsely grated Monterey Jack or pepper Jack (heaping 1/3 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium (10-inch) nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high.
