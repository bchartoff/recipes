{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Bean and Corn Almondine", "description": "The classic French dish of green beans and almonds gets a fun update with the addition of corn, which lends extra sweetness, chewy texture and pops of golden color. The simply prepared dish allows the tender green beans and corn to shine in a velvety garlic- and thyme-infused butter sauce. The nutty flavor and delicate crunch of toasted sliced almonds round out the dish. (Haricots verts also work beautifully here, in place of the green beans, but decrease the steaming time to 3 minutes.) This quick and versatile salad pairs well with many different foods and can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/14/dining/14sidesgiving-almondine/14sidesgiving-almondine--articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "almond, corn, green beans, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 649}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup sliced almonds (2 ounces)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 1/2 pounds green beans, trimmed", "5 thyme sprigs", "Salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 cups fresh corn kernels (from 2 to 3 ears), or use thawed from frozen"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
