{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orange and Radish Salad With Pistachios", "description": "Before I put this salad together, I could imagine how it would feel and taste in my mouth: the juicy, sweet oranges playing against the crisp, pungent radishes. The combination was inspired by an orange, radish and carrot salad in Sally Butcher\u2019s charming book \u201cSalmagundi: A Celebration of Salads From Around the World.\u201d\n\nThe salad is a showcase for citrus, which is in season in California. Navels are particularly good right now, both the regular variety and the darker pink-fleshed Cara Cara oranges that taste like a cross between an orange and a pink grapefruit. I fell in love with blood oranges when I lived in Paris years ago, and although the Moro variety that we get in the United States doesn\u2019t have quite as intense a red-berry flavor as the Mediterranean fruit, its color is hard to resist.\n\nHere I use a combination of blood oranges and navels, and a beautiful mix of red and purple radishes and daikon. Dress this bright mixture with roasted pistachio oil, which has a mild nutty flavor that marries beautifully with the citrus.\n\nPut the prepared oranges and radishes in separate bowls and use a slotted spoon to remove the orange slices from the juices. Just before serving, arrange the oranges and radishes on a platter or on plates, spoon on the dressing and juices, and sprinkle with pistachios. You can also layer the elements, undressed, and pour on the liquids right before serving.\n\nFor a juicier version, skip the slotted spoon and toss all of the ingredients together for a quenching salad that is best served in bowls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/14/science/recipehealthradish/recipehealthradish-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 188}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 178, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "614 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 blood oranges (about 1/2 pound)", "2 medium navel oranges (about 1 pound)", "Fleur de sel or coarse sea salt to taste", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint, plus more for garnish", "6 ounces radishes (about 1 cup sliced)", "4 ounces daikon radish (about 1/3 daikon)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon agave nectar", "1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste", "Pinch cayenne", "2 tablespoons roasted pistachio oil", "1/4 cup lightly toasted unsalted pistachios (about 1 ounce)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove orange peels: Cut off both ends of the oranges.
