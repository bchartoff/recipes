{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi Noodle Soup With Wilted Greens", "description": "Jjigae, a classic Korean kimchi stew, is the inspiration for this spicy, comforting soup. Unlike many soups, this one\u00a0doesn\u2019t require a lengthy simmer on the stovetop to develop complex flavor, as its ingredients bring complexity: Soy sauce adds umami and kimchi provides pleasant funkiness. Should you want to add shrimp, toss them in with the greens in Step 4, as they only take a minute or so to cook through. While jjigae is traditionally served with white rice, here it is served with delightfully chewy Japanese udon noodles. Although garnishes are always optional, the suggested toppings really take it there, and you should.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/21/dining/ch-kimchi-soup/merlin_172693110_d25d99bf-0860-4b7d-8db8-0b88c2ccd980-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "garlic, ginger, kimchi, scallion, soy sauce, udon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 475}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (10-ounce) package dried udon", "2 tablespoons neutral oil", "6 scallions thinly sliced, plus more for garnish", "1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "Kosher salt", "1 cup roughly chopped kimchi, plus 1/3 cup kimchi juice", "5 cups vegetable or chicken stock", "1/2 cup soy sauce", "4 cups roughly chopped greens, such as kale, spinach, tatsoi\u00a0or bok choy", "White sesame seeds, soft-boiled eggs, chile oil and roughly chopped cilantro, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook udon according to package instructions.
