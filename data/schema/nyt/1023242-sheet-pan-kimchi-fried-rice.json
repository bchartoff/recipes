{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Kimchi Fried Rice", "description": "Kimchi fried rice doesn\u2019t need a weeknight makeover \u2014 it\u2019s already so easy. But this oven method maximizes the surface area of the dish by using a sheet pan, increasing the potential for that coveted nurungji, or scorched rice. By baking this dish, you can start with fresh rice (no need for day-old), as the dry oven heat draws out the moisture from the moist grains and turns them crispy-chewy, plus the only active cooking required here is stirring together the ingredients. The oven handles the rest, which means no actual stir-frying. Eggs cracked on top, gently baked to silky perfection, are a necessary finish, as the runny yolks sauce the gochugaru-stained rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/15ESSENTIALSrex9/merlin_207573351_7a6a92ff-59e7-40b2-a1cc-451d1d009542-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, main course, side dish", "keywords": "gochujang, kimchi, medium-grain rice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 671}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups uncooked medium-grain white rice", "1/4 cup toasted sesame oil", "1/4 cup gochujang", "1/4 cup <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023243-tong-baechu-kimchi\">napa cabbage kimchi</a> juice, plus 16 ounces kimchi, coarsely chopped (about 2 cups)", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "Salt", "1 large onion, cut into medium dice", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces", "20 grams gim (often labeled as roasted seaweed), crushed", "6 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the rice in a sieve and rinse it under cold running water, shaking constantly, just a few seconds.
