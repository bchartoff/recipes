{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Cupcakes With Cream Filling", "description": "Here is a homemade take on the Hostess Cupcake, the sweet, well-preserved treat that was lost, for a while, to the wilds of bankruptcy. They take a little time to make, but are well worth it. (Don\u2019t skimp on the Marshmallow Fluff!) Wrapping the finished items individually in cellophane allow eaters to experience the twinkly crinkle of childhood afternoons spent carefully removing the chocolate frosting from the cupcake\u2019s top. But these are decidedly not the original. Whatever you do, make sure they\u2019re stored in something airtight. They will dry out quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jennifer Steinhauer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/Homemade-Junk-Food/Homemade-Junk-Food-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 dozen.", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cake flour, cocoa, marshmallow fluff, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 289}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 410, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "86 milligrams", "sugarContent": "32 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick vegetable oil spray", "80 grams (1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) cake flour", "30 grams (1/3 cup) Dutch process cocoa", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "Pinch of salt", "2 large eggs, separated", "3/4 cup canola oil", "110 grams (1/2 cup) plus 2 tablespoons sugar", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "165 grams (1 1/2 cups) confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 cup Marshmallow Fluff", "2 tablespoons heavy cream", "1/4 cup heavy cream", "4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the cakes: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
