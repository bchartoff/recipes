{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basmati Rice Pilaf With Cauliflower, Carrots and Peas", "description": "Inspired by a Turkish pilaf recipe by Clifford A. Wright, cardamom, allspice and cinnamon make this pilaf incredibly aromatic. The authentic version calls for lots of butter and uses long grain rice. I used a combination of (less) butter and olive oil, and made the pilaf with basmati rice, as that is what I had in my pantry. I needed less than the 2 cups of rice that Mr. Wright calls for in his recipe, as basmati expands more than regular white rice. I also added a small amount of whole grain in the form of cooked wild rice, to get a nice mix of colors, textures and nutrients.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/31/science/recipehealthrice/recipehealthrice-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean, middle eastern, turkish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 115}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 300, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "641 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup basmati rice", "1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 3/4 cups water", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 shallots or 1 small onion, finely chopped", "1 cup diced carrots", "6 ounces cauliflower, broken into very small florets (2 cups)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill or parsley", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground cardamom seeds (from green cardamom pods)", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon sugar", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1/3 cup currants, sultanas, golden or black raisins, soaked for 20 minutes in hot water and drained", "1/2 to 1 cup frozen peas (to taste)", "3 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted until golden", "3/4 cup cooked wild rice (about 1/3 cup uncooked)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak basmati rice in water to cover for 30 minutes (prepare the other ingredients during this time).
