He did it by eliminating half the egg whites. During this period, he was into simplicity, he said, and he wanted to get to the essential \u201cegginess\u201d of egg salad. The recipe remains unchanged more than 40 years later. But what of all the leftover hard-cooked egg whites? E.A.T. sells them as chopped egg white salad in two versions: plain, and dressed with mayonnaise and dill.
