This recipe descends from the Argentine way of making these little meat pies. The Argentine empanada is small, just two or three delicious bites. The technique to master in this recipe is holding the open empanada with one hand and using the other hand to crimp the outer edge and for a decorative braid. The less dexterous among us should use a fork for this.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/03/dining/03KITCH_2/03KITCH_2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "36 empanadas", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "beef, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 673}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces lard or butter, plus more for brushing tops", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "750 grams all-purpose flour, about 6 cups, more as needed", "1 pound beef chuck, in 1/8-inch dice (or very coarsely ground)\n", "Salt and pepper", "Lard or olive oil, or a combination, for saut\u00e9ing", "1 cup diced onion", "2 ounces diced chorizo", "1/2 pound potatoes, peeled and diced", "4 garlic cloves, mashed to a paste", "2 teaspoons chopped thyme", "2 teaspoons chopped marjoram or 1 teaspoon oregano", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 tablespoon piment\u00f3n dulce or paprika\n\n", "Large pinch cayenne", "Beef or chicken broth, as necessary, or use water", "1/2 cup chopped scallions, white and green parts", "1/4 cup chopped pitted green olives", "2 hard-cooked eggs, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Put 2 cups boiling water, 4 ounces lard and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in large mixing bowl.
