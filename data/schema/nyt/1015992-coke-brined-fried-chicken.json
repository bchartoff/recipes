{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coke-Brined Fried Chicken", "description": "John Currence, of City Grocery in Oxford, Miss., spent a long time in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit, and was justly celebrated for his hard work there helping to rebuild a cathedral of Southern fried chicken, Willie Mae\u2019s Scotch House. In his 2013 cookbook, \u201cPickles, Pigs and Whiskey,\u201d Currence paid tribute to the wet batter used on Willie Mae\u2019s legendary dish. But for the purpose of weekend chicken warriors we have omitted it in our adaptation of his homage, concentrating instead on Currence\u2019s use of a Coke-based poultry brine that not only adds some sweetness to the chicken thighs he uses but mildly tenderizes them along the way. Let the meat sit in the brine for a few hours before using, but not so long as overnight, where it really begins to break down. Then dry the thighs, dredge them in seasoned flour, and fry in peanut oil, ideally enhanced by lard. The result is mahogany-brown chicken with a crisp crust and a luscious interior.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/29/dining/29JPBOWL1/29JPBOWL1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 381}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 cups Coca-Cola", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "10 sprigs fresh thyme", "4 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced", "4 teaspoons mild hot sauce like Crystal, Texas Pete or Cholula", "8 to 12 chicken thighs, preferably free-range, organic", "3 cups all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons ground black pepper", "2 teaspoons smoked Spanish paprika", "1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder", "1 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "3 cups peanut oil", "1 cup lard, optional, or replace with peanut oil", "Hot sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the brine: Combine cola, salt, thyme, garlic and hot sauce in a large metal bowl and stir until the salt has dissolved.
