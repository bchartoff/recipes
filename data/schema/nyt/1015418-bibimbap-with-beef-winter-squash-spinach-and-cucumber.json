{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bibimbap With Beef, Winter Squash, Spinach and Cucumber", "description": "Bibimbap is a classic Korean mixed-rice dish. In traditional bibimbap, a large serving of rice is placed in the center of a hot bowl and surrounded with small amounts of meat \u2014 usually beef \u2014 and seasoned vegetables that include a mixture of cultivated vegetables (cucumber, carrot, daikon or turnips, spinach, lettuce, mushrooms) and wild items like fiddlehead ferns and reconstituted dried toraji (bellflower roots). A fried egg is often placed on top of the rice, and diners stir everything together. This recipe breaks with traditional bibimbap by using brown rice (you could also use barley, quinoa or another grain of your choice). As for the winter squash and spinach? The recipe is a template: use whatever vegetables you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/20/dining/bibimbap/bibimbap-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 32}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces beef, like top sirloin, thinly sliced across the grain", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 teaspoon sugar or brown sugar", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds", "1 to 2 garlic cloves, to taste, minced or pur\u00e9ed", "A half-inch piece of ginger, minced", "2 scallions, finely chopped", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "2 large garlic cloves, minced or pur\u00e9ed", "2 to 3 scallions, minced", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds", "Salt to taste", "Korean red pepper paste (kochujang) to taste (available at Korean markets) (optional)", "2 Persian cucumbers or 1/2 long European cucumber, thinly sliced", "1/2 pound winter squash, like butternut, peeled and sliced or cut in 3/4-inch dice", "1 12-ounce bunch spinach, stemmed and washed, or 1 6-ounce bag baby spinach", "6 fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced", "Soy sauce to taste", "1 tablespoon canola oil", "1 1/2 to 2 cups brown rice, barley, quinoa or another grain of your choice, cooked (keep hot)", "4 eggs (optional)", "Korean red pepper paste (kochujang) to taste (available at Korean markets)", "2 sheets nori seaweed (kimgui), lightly toasted* and cut into thin strips (optional)", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds or black sesame seeds", "Toast nori sheets (if not toasted already) by quickly passing them over a gas flame (hold with tongs) until crisp."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate the beef.
