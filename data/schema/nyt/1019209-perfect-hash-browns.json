{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Perfect Hash Browns", "description": "When it comes to breakfast potatoes, most people fall into one of two camps: home fries or hash browns. This recipe from Alison Roman shows you how to make an ideal batch of the hashed variety that are aggressively crisp on the outside and creamy tender on the inside. To ensure ultimate crispness, be sure to rinse the grated potatoes with cold water until the water runs nearly clear and to use a very hot, well-seasoned pan. As with all potato dishes, remember to season well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/dining/15COOKING-HASHBROWN3/15COOKING-HASHBROWN3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, vegetables", "keywords": "side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 182}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 516, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "821 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds russet potatoes (about 2 smallish-medium potatoes), peeled", "1 small yellow onion, peeled", "Kosher salt", "Freshly ground pepper", "3 tablespoons bacon fat or vegetable oil, plus more if needed", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Hot sauce or ketchup (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate potatoes on the largest hole on a box grater into a medium bowl.
