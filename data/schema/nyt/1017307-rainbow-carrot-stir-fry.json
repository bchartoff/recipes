{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rainbow Carrot Stir-Fry", "description": "In January, a friend gave me beautiful lacquered chopsticks from Shanghai. That was a spur for me to pull out my wok for a stir-fry of spring onions and young carrots of all colors: purple and dark red-orange, yellow and the familiar orange.\n\nI\u2019ve made many rainbow pepper stir-fries, but this time I used my multicolored carrots, and cut them into matchsticks so they would cook quickly along with the spring onions. I wanted this to be a main dish, so I added tofu, as well as the aromatics that I always use in my stir-fries: garlic, ginger, dry sherry, soy sauce and a bit of sugar. The list of ingredients in stir-fry recipes can look long, even daunting. But most of the ingredients don\u2019t require knife skills, just measuring spoons, so the preparation is simple. And the actual cooking goes very quickly, so quickly that it\u2019s important to have everything prepped and within reach of your wok. Read through the recipe a couple of times before you begin cooking, because once you start, you won\u2019t have time to refer to it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/18/dining/18MARTHA1/18MARTHA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "carrots, spring onions, tofu, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 124}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 295, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "634 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 14-ounce box firm tofu, cut into dominoes", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry", "1/4 cup vegetable or chicken stock, or water", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon sugar (to taste)", "1 teaspoon cornstarch or arrowroot", "2 tablespoons peanut or other neutral oil", "2 to 3 teaspoons minced garlic (to taste)", "2 to 3 teaspoons minced ginger (to taste)", "1 pound carrots, preferably a mix of colors, cut into matchsticks", "1 bunch spring onions or 2 bunches scallions, white or purple, and light green parts separated from dark green parts, chopped", "1 tablespoon black or toasted white sesame seeds", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "Cooked grains or noodles, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain and dry tofu slices on paper towels.
