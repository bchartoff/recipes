{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Tortillas", "description": "I am a firm believer that the tortilla makes the taco. It is a travesty to slow-cook meats and beans, find delicious cheeses and chop fresh herbs only to throw them onto stale, chemical-laden tortillas. For this recipe, I recommend purchasing a tortilla press, though it is not necessary. Tortillas aren\u2019t hard to make, but they require a little bit of practice.\u00a0 The most delicious tortillas come from masa made from nixtamalized corn, but you can also make masa from good quality masa harina. Tortilla factories will often sell you prepared masa.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jessamyn Rodriguez"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "10 6-inch tortillas", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, masa, tortilla", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 165, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": null, "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound masa, either from nixtamalized masa prepared from masa harina or store-bought fresh masa"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If you are making the masa, choose a good masa harina with as few ingredients as possible, preferably just corn and lime, like Bob's Red Mill.
