{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Pudding", "description": "Anyone looking to try one\u2019s hand at playing around with a recipe can\u2019t do better than to start with rice pudding. I began making rice pudding with our son\u2019s babysitter, a Frenchwoman named Marie-C\u00e9cile, who cooked au pif, meaning she followed her instincts and would riff on just about everything she made. Moi? I followed Marie-C\u00e9cile\u2019s lead and have been making my own version of rice pudding regularly, but rarely with the same flavorings. Sometimes I\u2019ll stir chocolate into the pudding right before it\u2019s cooked, and often I\u2019ll top the pudding with roasted fruit. For apples, cut 2 unpeeled apples into 1/4-inch wedges. Cook 1/2 cup sugar in a nonstick skillet until amber (stir only after the sugar starts to color), add 2 tablespoons butter followed by the apples. Cook, turning the wedges, for 6 to 8 minutes, until translucent.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/14/magazine/14mag-ondessert/14mag-14ondessert-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "dessert, jasmine rice, milk, vanilla bean", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 286}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 105, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "331 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup (100 grams) long-grain rice, preferably jasmine", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 quart (946 ml.) whole milk", "1/4 to 1/3 cup (50-67 grams) sugar (to taste)", "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the rice under cold running water, then turn it into a medium saucepan, and cover with water.

Stay close: Milk is notorious for bubbling over. Lower the heat, stir in the rice and cook at a steady simmer, stirring frequently (especially at the start) for 30-40 minutes, or until the rice is very tender, the pudding feels just a little thick as you stir it and most of the milk has been absorbed (the pudding will have cooked down by about half). It\u2019s hard to give an exact time because it depends on the rice, the size of the pan and the amount of heat beneath it."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Scrape the pudding into a heatproof bowl, and remove the vanilla bean, if you\u2019ve used it.
