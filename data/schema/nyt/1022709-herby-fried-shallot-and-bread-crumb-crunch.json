{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herby Fried Shallot and Bread Crumb Crunch", "description": "This recipe begins with shallots fried Southeast Asian style, starting in cold oil, with a method so simple you\u2019ll never do it any other way. You don\u2019t need a thermometer or any other special equipment \u2014 just patience and a careful eye. In exchange, you\u2019re rewarded with caramel-sweet shallots that crunch, then melt between your teeth. Next, rosemary, sage and stale bread crumbs take turns in the oil, crisping as they cool. Then, they\u2019re tossed with chopped parsley, thyme and a little flaky salt. From the moment the mixture is done, you won\u2019t be able to stop eating it. But if you wait, it makes the perfect topping for green bean casserole, potato gratin, or macaroni and cheese. Sprinkle it atop mashed potatoes doused with gravy, or just put a bowl of it on the table and let people do with it what they will \u2014 they\u2019ll probably end up putting some on every bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15unboringrex3-crunch/15unboringrex3-crunch-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "bread, rosemary, sage, shallot, fall, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 379}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 large loaf stale country bread, crusts removed and diced into 1-inch cubes (about 5 heaping cups)", "2 1/2 cups thinly sliced shallot rings (from about 7 shallots)", "2 cups neutral oil, such as canola or safflower, for frying", "Flaky sea salt", "12 sage leaves (from 2 to 3 sprigs)", "1/4 packed cup fresh rosemary leaves (from 4 to 5 sprigs)", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves (from about 1/3 large bunch)", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme (from 8 to 9 sprigs)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, pulse the bread until no pieces larger than a pea remain.
