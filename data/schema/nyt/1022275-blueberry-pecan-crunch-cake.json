{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry Pecan Crunch Cake", "description": "Topped with coarse Demerara sugar and chopped pecans, this might just be the crunchiest coffee cake you\u2019ve ever made. It\u2019s also one of the easiest, as it\u2019s quickly whisked together in just one bowl. Soft, juicy blueberries dot the cinnamon-scented batter, making jammy pockets in the tender crumb. It will keep at room temperature for up to three days, though the topping does lose a little texture the longer it sits. But this cake is so good, its keeping qualities may be beside the point.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/28/dining/mc-cake/mc-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "blueberries, demerara sugar, make-ahead, one bowl, pecan, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1306}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/337 grams sour cream", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 stick), melted and cooled", "4 large eggs", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "2 1/2 cups/312 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups/200 grams blueberries", "2/3 cup/85 grams chopped pecans (or walnuts or almonds)", "2 tablespoons Demerara sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and butter a 9-by-9-inch metal pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the sour cream, butter, eggs, vanilla and salt until everything is well combined.
