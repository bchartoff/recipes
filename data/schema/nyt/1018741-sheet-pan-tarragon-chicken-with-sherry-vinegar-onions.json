{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Tarragon Chicken With Sherry Vinegar Onions", "description": "Roasting chicken with tarragon is a classic combination, but here it\u2019s given a twist. Instead of a whole bird, bone-in thighs are marinated in tarragon and garlic, then quickly roasted over a bed of sliced onions. As the chicken cooks, the fat renders, coating the onions, while the fragrant steam rising from the onions flavors the bird. It\u2019s a succulent, easy and very flavorful dinner. If you\u2019d rather use all white meat, substitute bone-in chicken breast halves, and start checking them after 20 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/03/dining/03APPE1/03APPE1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, onion, tarragon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1353}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup finely chopped tarragon (leaves and tender stems), plus 4 whole sprigs", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, more as needed", "3 pounds bone-in chicken thighs (skin on)", "2 large onions, peeled and sliced (about 4 cups)", "4 thyme sprigs", "Sherry vinegar, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, stir together tarragon, garlic, oil, salt and pepper.
