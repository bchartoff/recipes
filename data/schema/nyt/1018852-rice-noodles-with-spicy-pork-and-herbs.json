{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Noodles With Spicy Pork and Herbs", "description": "This cold rice-noodle dish, dressed in vinegar and chile oil and topped with spicy pork, herbs and peanuts, has roots in Yunnan, a southwestern Chinese province, where the garnish may vary according to the kitchen and season. The dish is quick to put together but can be served at a leisurely pace: Plate it, or set all of the components on the table and let people put together their own bowls the way they like, to their taste. The chef Simone Tong, who runs a Yunnan-inspired noodle restaurant in Manhattan, makes her version with ground pork, peanuts and a mix of fresh herbs but adds raw breakfast radishes and lacto-fermented pickles as well, for extra crunch and flavor. Feel free to do the same, or not; it\u2019s in the spirit of the dish to improvise with what\u2019s in season and what\u2019s on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/23/magazine/23eat1/23eat1-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "pork, rice noodles", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 942}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 698, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "97 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "513 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound thin, round rice noodles", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon black vinegar", "1 tablespoon chile oil (like Lao Gan Ma brand)", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1 tablespoon canola or other neutral oil", "1/2 pound ground pork", "1 teaspoon salt", "2 garlic cloves, sliced", "1 1-inch piece ginger, chopped", "2 scallions, light parts chopped, green parts reserved for garnish", "1 tablespoon yacai (Sichuan preserved vegetables, optional)", "Handful of herbs like mint, basil and cilantro leaves, washed", "1/4 cup salted, roasted peanuts, chopped", "4 breakfast radishes, sliced (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to boil, and cook noodles according to instructions.
