{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cilantro-Date Chutney", "description": "Inspired by two classic Parsi recipes from the chef and anthropologist Niloufer Ichaporia King, this sauce introduces the toasted cumin and medjool dates from her date and tamarind chutney into her classic green chutney, full of fresh ginger, jalape\u00f1o and lime. The ginger and the sweetness of the dates echo many of the flavors already present on the Thanksgiving table, and the cilantro, chiles and lime bring a much welcome vividness. It\u2019s a delight! This sauce is also fantastic on leftover turkey sandwiches, and, other times of year, it makes for a great condiment on rice, fish, chicken and vegetable dishes alike.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15unboringrex5-chutney/merlin_197274693_ee743daa-1234-4d31-b7cf-416006decb6e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, lime juice, medjool dates, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 221}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "10 medjool dates, pitted", "1/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, plus more to taste (from 2 to 3 limes)", "2 jalape\u00f1os, stemmed and thinly sliced (remove seeds if desired for a milder sauce)", "1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger", "6 garlic cloves, finely grated", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste", "4 cups loosely packed cilantro leaves and tender stems (from about 2 large bunches)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place cumin in a small skillet and set over medium-high heat.
