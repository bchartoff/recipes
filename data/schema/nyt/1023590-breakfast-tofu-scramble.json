And it\u2019s a cinch to make, even with just one eye open: Sear large slabs of tofu, then break them into irregular pieces. The craggy edges of the tofu absorb a seasoning mixture that\u2019s reminiscent of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019030-maple-breakfast-sausage\">breakfast sausage</a>: sweet from maple syrup, herbaceous from sage, and spicy from hot sauce and black pepper. Feel free to add vegetables that are already cooked, or that cook in 2 minutes, along with the maple-sage mixture, but if you do so, you may want to increase the seasoning accordingly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/02/dining/as-maple-sage-tofu-scramble/merlin_215246061_4dc87d51-939c-4d86-9899-08a16a128c3c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, easy, for two, lunch, quick, weeknight, beans, main course, side dish", "keywords": "extra-firm tofu, firm tofu, hot sauce, maple syrup, sage, soy sauce, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 54}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14- to 16-ounce) block firm or extra-firm tofu, drained", "3 tablespoons maple syrup, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage or 1 teaspoon dried sage", "1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, plus more for serving", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set the tofu on one of its large flat sides and cut it in half horizontally.
