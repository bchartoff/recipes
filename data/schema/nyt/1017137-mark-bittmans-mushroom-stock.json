What\u2019s needed is something you can produce more or less on the spot. \n\nAlthough water is a suitable proxy in small quantities, when it comes to making the bubbling, chest-warming soups that we rely on in winter, water needs some help. Fortunately, there are almost certainly flavorful ingredients sitting in your fridge or pantry that can transform water into a good stock in a matter of minutes.\n\nThis recipe is meant to be fast, so by \u2018\u2018simmer,\u2019\u2019 I mean as little as five minutes and no more than 15. You can season these stocks at the end with salt and pepper to taste, or wait until you\u2019re ready to turn them into full-fledged soups.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/18/magazine/18eat_stockmarket-slide-BTMN/18eat_stockmarket-slide-BTMN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "About 6 cups of stock", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, soups and stews", "keywords": "button mushrooms, porcini, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 58}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 3, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "0 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound button mushrooms, trimmed", "3 dried porcini", "Some onion, carrot or celery (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss a pound of trimmed button mushrooms and a few dried porcini into 6 cups water.
