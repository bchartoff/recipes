{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wild Rice With Mushrooms", "description": "In Wisconsin, wild rice is truly wild, not cultivated as in other states, the tassels rising and swaying over rivers, lakes and floodplains come late August and September. Called manoomin by the local Chippewa, it is a protected crop that can be harvested only by state residents holding a valid license. And only by hand, as the Chippewa have always done, using wooden flails gently (the grains should fall from the stalk without great effort) from canoes propelled by paddles or push poles.\nShellie Holmes of Rhinelander, Wis., who shares her recipe here, likes to cook wild rice just until it pops open. This is a break with her family\u2019s tradition, which favored a chewier texture and did not allow popping.\n\u201cDo not mix with other rice,\u201d she urged, lest you lose the flavor of the wild.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19WISCONSIN/19WISCONSIN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "button mushrooms, cremini, dry sherry, wild rice, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 478}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 298, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "203 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces long-grain Wisconsin wild rice", "8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter", "1 pound cremini or button mushrooms, sliced", "1/2 teaspoon salt, more to taste", "Black pepper, to taste", "1/3 cup dry sherry, such as Dry Sack (do not use cream sherry)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 5 cups water to a boil.
