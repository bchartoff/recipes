{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cobb Salad", "description": "While the origins of a Cobb salad are still up for debate, what goes into one is fairly absolute: tender chicken breast, tangy tomatoes, perfectly hard-boiled egg and, perhaps most important, crispy bacon. This classic version relies on crumbled blue cheese and ripe avocado for creaminess, rather than a cheese or buttermilk-based dressing, making way for a mustardy shallot vinaigrette. The way each of the ingredients is prepared will depend on personal preference: Are you a chunky, chopped salad kind of person? Or do you prefer your lettuce torn and tomatoes sliced? Here, the torn and sliced approach is taken for a more elegant visual, but feel free to make it your own. It also halves nicely if you're cooking for two.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/03/dining/COOKING-COBB-SALAD1/COOKING-COBB-SALAD1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "avocado, bacon, blue cheese, chicken breast, tomato, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 651}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 738, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "56 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1189 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small shallot, thinly sliced into rings", "3 tablespoons red-wine vinegar", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "1 tablespoon whole grain or Dijon mustard", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "4 large eggs", "10 ounces thick-cut bacon (about 8 strips)", "12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2 medium breasts)", "1 head romaine lettuce, torn into bite-sized pieces or coarsely chopped", "6 ounces small to medium tomatoes (about 6), sliced or quartered", "1 avocado, thinly sliced or chopped", "4 ounces blue cheese, crumbled", "3 tablespoons finely chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: Cover shallot rings with vinegar and season with salt and pepper.
