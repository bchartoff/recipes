{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meatloaf With Moroccan Spices", "description": "This recipe is from \"A Meatloaf in Every Oven,\" by Frank Bruni and Jennifer Steinhauer, who say it was the invention of a friend, Anne Kornblut. The plethora of spices and large amounts of garlic may seem overwhelming, but ground meat has a deep tolerance for seasoning and is usually improved by it. The fresh herbs are a foil for all the rich seasonings, and the vegetables give the loaf an especially lovely texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/08/dining/08MEATLOAF3/08MEATLOAF3-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 generous servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "ginger root, ground lamb, whole-wheat bread crumbs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 196}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 746, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "54 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "820 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil, more as needed", "1 medium onion, diced (about 1 cup)", "12 garlic cloves, minced", "1 to 2 medium stalks celery, diced (about 1/2 cup)", "1 large carrot, diced (about 1/2 cup)", "3 inches fresh ginger root, peeled and minced (about 1/3 cup)", "2 tablespoons ground cumin", "2 tablespoons smoked paprika", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon salt", "7 tablespoons tomato paste", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves", "2 eggs, lightly beaten", "1 cup whole-wheat bread crumbs", "2 pounds ground lamb", "1/2 cup pine nuts toasted in a 350-degree oven until fragrant and golden brown (about 5 to 7 minutes)", "1 cup plain full-fat Greek-style yogurt", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from about 1 lemon)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
