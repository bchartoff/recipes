{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta Amatriciana\u00a0", "description": "Pasta amatriciana is a traditional Italian dish that features a sauce of guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), tomato, pecorino romano and chiles. Some variations include onion and white wine. The final product tastes much more complex than the ingredient list would suggest: This simple pantry meal delivers deep flavors, as the bright, tangy tomato base balances the rich pork, and a mix of dried peppers adds layers of subtle heat. Guanciale can be found in Italian specialty shops or online, but pancetta is a good alternative. Bucatini is a thicker pasta with a hollow center that captures the thick sauce, but spaghetti delivers equally tasty results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/02/dining/kc-pasta-amatriciana/merlin_201502869_17a64c2f-adee-4526-9951-a0b03270b022-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1484}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 ounces guanciale or pancetta, chopped into \u00bc-inch cubes (3/4 cup)", "1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, crushed with your hands in a bowl", "1/8 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 pound dried bucatini\u00a0", "3/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat olive oil over medium.
