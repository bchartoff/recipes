{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Collard Greens and Cornmeal Dumplings", "description": "Collard greens are a common dish in many African American households, and are especially important during New Year\u2019s celebrations. In folklore, the greens represent dollar bills, and the more you eat, the more money you\u2019ll have in the new year. In this version, adapted from \u201cJubilee: Recipes from Two Centuries of African American Cooking,\u201d by Toni Tipton-Martin, cornmeal dumplings simmer with the greens in a smoky stock. The dough is made using that rich potlikker and then added towards the end of cooking so the dumplings don\u2019t become soggy. This combination of greens and dumplings parallels the West African pairing of soups and stews with fufu, an accompaniment traditionally made from pounded yam, cassava or other starch. This is delicious on its own, but even better with black-eyed peas and rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kayla Stewart"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/29/dining/27NEW-YEARSREX1/merlin_199513152_b9939b1f-9b97-4ba1-b2d2-86e436cb515b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "collard greens, ham hock, onion, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 107}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 smoked ham hocks or 2 smoked turkey wings", "2 medium onions, quartered", "4 celery stalks, including leaves, halved", "2 carrots, scrubbed and quartered", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns", "2 dried bay leaves", "1/2 small onion, chopped", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 large bunch (1 pound) collard greens", "2 small dried red chiles or 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups coarsely ground cornmeal", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon fine salt", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the stock: In a large heavy stockpot, bring 3 quarts water, the smoked meat, onions, celery, carrots, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaves to a boil.
