As long as you use all-butter pastry and good tomatoes, you can vary or skip the cheese and herbs. Or if you have some mascarpone left over from your baked stuffed tomatoes, a smear of it at the bottom of the crust makes a luxuriant cushion.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/04/dining/Tomato-Tartlets/Tomato-Tartlets-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 or more tartlets", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, heirloom tomatoes, puff pastry, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 48}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 393, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "287 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 small firm heirloom tomatoes, preferably in different colors", "Flour for dusting", "1 14-ounce package puff pastry, defrosted but cold", "1/4 cup mascarpone, optional", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil", "Coarse sea salt, to taste (fleur de sel is a good choice)", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
