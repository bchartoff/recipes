You'll want to mix the ingredients until they're fluffy, and until the icing flows fluidly from the whisk. Once it's the texture of hot fudge, it'll be ready to apply to your cookies. After it dries, at least an hour later, it\u2019ll take on a matte, smooth appearance resembling an eggshell, a perfect canvas for your most inspired designs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/09/multimedia/guides-royal-icing/guides-royal-icing-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "About 1 3/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, egg whites, salt, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 133}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 302, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "75 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "49 milligrams", "sugarContent": "74 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large egg whites", "3 3/4 cups/453 grams confectioners' sugar (a standard 1-pound box)", "Pinch of cream of tartar", "Pinch of kosher salt", "Food coloring (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using an electric mixer, whisk egg whites till light and foamy, about 1 minute."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add powdered sugar, cream of tartar and salt to egg whites and continue to whisk, stopping to scrape down bowl as necessary, until extremely light and fluffy, almost like shaving cream."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Thin icing with water by the tablespoonful until it has the viscosity of hot fudge.
