{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quealy\u2019s Queso", "description": "Chili con queso is a standard party dip in South Texas, where the chef Quealy Watson lives and works: melted cheese with chopped green chiles, generally, to be served with chips. Watson gives the dish an Asian spin, using the Southeast Asian chile paste known as sambal oelek in place of the green chiles. The Velveeta cheese he calls for is not for everyone, but it is powerfully easy to work with \u2014 you couldn\u2019t break it if you tried. Heavy cream helps thin out the queso a little, and the chile paste gives it a fascinating fire.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/06/magazine/06quealysqueso/06quealysqueso-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 176}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 206, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "291 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound Velveeta cheese", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "3 tablespoons sambal oelek or sriracha"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut cheese into chunks, and place in a microwave-safe bowl.
