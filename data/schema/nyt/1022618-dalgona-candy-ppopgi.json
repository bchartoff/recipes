In postwar South Korea, vendors outside schools and toy stores made and sold these tan disks stamped with shapes. They would offer a free one to children who could pick out the shape with a needle without breaking the candy in a game called ppopgi. Preparing the candy at home requires only two ingredients and attention at the stove. The ladle needs to be moved away from the heat occasionally to stir away any lumps without burning the melting sugar. If you want to make multiple candies quickly, keep a small saucepan of boiled water in the sink to quickly clean hardened sugar off the ladle.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/13/dining/08DALGONAREX/merlin_195947142_5eab95de-9ef4-4d5c-91fc-adb2b84fd342-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 candy", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "candies, dessert", "keywords": "baking soda, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 216}, "recipeIngredient": ["A pinch of baking soda", "Vegetable oil, for greasing", "1 heaping tablespoon granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The candy sets quickly, so have everything ready: Set the baking soda, a sheet of parchment paper, a small skillet and a 3-inch metal cookie cutter (any shape) on a heatproof work surface next to the stove.
