{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quinoa Salad With Roasted Carrots and Frizzled Leeks", "description": "This quinoa salad, filled with soft roasted carrots, currants and a pomegranate molasses-spiked dressing, makes enough to feed a crowd, though you can easily halve the recipe for a smaller group. You can make it  with any color quinoa you come across \u2013 it comes in shades of tan (called white), rusty red and brownish black. Just don\u2019t mix them together in one pot because they all have slightly different cooking times. As for the pomegranate molasses, it's available in specialty shops and online, but if you don\u2019t have it, substitute a good quality balsamic vinegar spiked with a little honey if you like. You can toss together the quinoa, dressing and carrots the day before serving, but don\u2019t add the arugula until the last minute to keep it as fresh and crisp as possible.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/multimedia/clark-quinoa-salad/clark-quinoa-salad-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "carrot, leek, quinoa, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 103}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 213, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "389 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 leek, trimmed", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for frying leeks and for serving", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice", "2 1/2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses, more for serving", "2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick coins", "2 cups quinoa (13 ounces)", "1/3 cup dried currants", "6 ounces fresh arugula"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut leek in half lengthwise and rinse away any grit.
