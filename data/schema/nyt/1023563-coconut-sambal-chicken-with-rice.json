{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Sambal Chicken With Rice", "description": "Sri Lankan coconut sambal is a savory and spicy condiment made mainly from freshly grated coconut, shallots or red onion and fresh or dried chiles. For convenience, this version uses unsweetened shredded coconut instead of fresh, since it\u2019s more accessible and easier to work with. The sambal can be customized to suit varying heat levels; use three chiles for a spicy sambal, or five for even more heat. It\u2019s typically served on the side as an accompaniment to meals, and commonly sprinkled over rice and curries. In this recipe, bright sambal complements lean chicken breast, which benefits from rich, nutty coconut milk. The sambal keeps for about a week in the fridge and is terrific on roasted fish and pork chops, as well as on saut\u00e9ed spinach or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022076-sauteed-broccoli-with-garlic-and-chile\">broccoli</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/12/multimedia/kc-coconut-sambal-chicken-and-rice-1-bf57/kc-coconut-sambal-chicken-and-rice-1-bf57-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, condiments, poultry, main course", "keywords": "cherry tomato, chicken breast, chicken thigh, chiles de \u00e1rbol, cilantro, coconut milk, food processor, grape tomato, lime juice, shallot, sri lankan, unsweetened coconut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 44}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 5 dried chiles de \u00e1rbol, stemmed and seeded", "3 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, halved (about \u00bd cup)", "1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut", "1 1/3 cups finely chopped shallots", "1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk, stirred", "2 tablespoons lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "Cooked short-grain rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, combine chiles and tomatoes, and pulse, scraping down the side and bottom of the bowl, until coarsely chopped.
