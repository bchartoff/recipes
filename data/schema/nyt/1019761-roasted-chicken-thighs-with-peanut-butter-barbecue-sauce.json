{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Chicken Thighs With Peanut Butter Barbecue Sauce", "description": "Peanut butter is the surprise guest in this spicy-sweet barbecue sauce, which cooks up in just 10 minutes. This versatile sauce, which adds nutty richness and depth, keeps for 2 weeks in the fridge and also freezes well. You'll have quite a bit: This recipe yields 2 cups of sauce. It's great to have on hand, doing double-duty as a sauce or a fantastic marinade for chicken or baby back ribs. (If allergies are a concern, substitute in almond butter for the peanut butter.) Serve with saut\u00e9ed green beans, roasted broccoli or coleslaw.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/16/dining/kc-pb-bbq-chicken/kc-pb-bbq-chicken-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thighs, molasses, peanut butter, soy sauce, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 263}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 757, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1442 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons canola oil", "1/4 cup minced onion (about 1/4 medium onion)", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1/2 cup natural smooth peanut butter", "1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/4 cup distilled white vinegar", "2 tablespoons turbinado or light brown sugar", "2 tablespoons unsulphured molasses", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "3/4 cup barbecue sauce", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the barbecue sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat oil.
