{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Pumpkin Seed Pesto", "description": "Fragrant with basil and rich with pumpkin seeds and cheese, this is the ideal dish to make ahead of time and pack for lunch. Instead of preparing it to eat as a hot meal or a cold salad, it\u2019s designed to be chilled and then enjoyed cold or at room temperature. Cooking the garlic quickly in the water boiled for the pasta softens its sharp edge. A splash of that same boiling water blends with the basil to keep it green. Rinsing the pasta after cooking it helps the pesto stay flavorful for days in the refrigerator. The tomatoes add a tangy freshness, but they can be skipped altogether or swapped for green beans or peas (just drop them with the pasta during the last few minutes or cooking).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/31/dining/31korex-pasta-1/merlin_211927842_67444fec-d194-4bd0-acc7-d6fbebbe0878-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "basil, make-ahead, parmesan, pasta, pumpkin seeds, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 500}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and pepper", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 pound fusilli or other short, curly pasta", "1/3 cup pumpkin seeds (pepitas), plus more for sprinkling", "1 large bunch basil (4 ounces), leaves and tender stems picked (3 cups)", "2/3 cup/2\u00bd ounces finely grated Parmesan, plus more for sprinkling", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 cups grape or cherry tomatoes, halved (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large saucepan of generously salted water to a boil.
