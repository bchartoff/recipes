{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Tacos With Chipotle", "description": "For good tacos, you need fresh, hot tortillas and a zesty filling. Canned chipotle chiles will do the trick with their smoky heat; it's an easy way to get flavor fast. Look for small cans with \u201cchipotle chiles in adobo\u201d on the label. And Mexican groceries generally have better-quality tortillas than the ones you find in supermarkets; it's worth seeking those out and heating them gently over steam, or by toasting them in a dry cast-iron pan. You can also use this recipe with precooked chicken, which makes this already quite simple recipe as easy as falling out of bed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/27/dining/27KITCH1/27KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "tacos", "keywords": "chicken, chipotles in adobo, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, tortilla, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 609}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large bone-in chicken thighs, about 1 1/2 pounds", "3 scallions, left whole", "1 bay leaf", "1 thyme branch", "3 black peppercorns", "1 allspice berry", "2 cloves", "Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium yellow onion, finely diced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 or 3 chipotle chiles in adobo, chopped", "3 tablespoons adobo sauce, from the can", "1/2 cup broth (use broth from simmered chicken)", "8 fresh corn tortillas", "1 small white onion, finely chopped, soaked in ice water for 10 minutes and drained", "Thinly sliced serrano chile", "Thinly sliced radishes", "Sliced avocado", "Crumbled queso fresco or mild feta cheese", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or Mexican crema", "Cilantro sprigs", "Dried oregano", "Lime wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put chicken thighs in a saucepan and cover with 3 cups water.
