{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Honey-Glazed Chicken and Shallots", "description": "The combination of a sweet glaze, tangy shallots and pan-roasted chicken makes this a quick but decadent one-pan meal. Caramelizing shallots first, then tossing them with sherry vinegar gives them a pickled but syrupy bite. A little heat from a spicy chile and some freshness from parsley leaves balance this flavorful dish. Serve right off the stove, over cooked grains or alongside a crisp salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/29/dining/yk-honey-glazed-chicken-and-shallots/merlin_196519869_21c2c013-4628-48ac-ae03-1090ed1f30e2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, shallot, vinegar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 827}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs or drumsticks (6 to 8 pieces)", "Salt", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1 pound shallots (about 8), peeled and halved, quartered if large", "3 tablespoons honey", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 fresh hot chile, such as Thai, Scotch bonnet or serrano, minced with or without seeds", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt.
