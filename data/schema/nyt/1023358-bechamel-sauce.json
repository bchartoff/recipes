Commonly used in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021031-the-big-lasagna\">lasagna</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022733-creamy-baked-macaroni-and-cheese\">mac and cheese</a>, it\u2019s a thickened mixture that involves first cooking flour in butter to create a roux, then whisking in milk to form a silky sauce. Traditionally the milk is heated first before it\u2019s whisked into the roux, but in the interest of saving time (and minimizing cleanup!), this method adds cold milk in small increments while whisking to prevent clumping. B\u00e9chamel can also jump-start many other sauces: Add grated Parmesan or Cheddar for an all-purpose cheese sauce, or mix in cooked ground sausage to make a rich breakfast gravy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/13/dining/kc-bechamel-sauce/kc-bechamel-sauce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1\u00bc cups", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "make-ahead, milk, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 189}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups whole milk", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper (or white pepper)", "Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium-low.
