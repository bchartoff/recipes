{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bijou", "description": "This classic 19th-century cocktail\u2019s name means \u201cjewel\u201d in French, in supposed reference to its combination of gem-colored spirits: diamond-clear gin, ruby-red sweet vermouth and emerald-green Chartreuse. While the original \u2014 often attributed to Harry Johnson, who published a recipe in the 1900 edition of his \u201cNew and Improved Bartender\u2019s Manual\u201d \u2014 called for equal parts, this variation skews the drink toward modern palates by reducing the amount of green Chartreuse. The final drink is balanced and dry, yet still plenty herbal. Serve and sip as is, or split between two very small, very pretty glasses for a petite-in-stature, big-in-flavor nightcap.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/22/dining/17dinnerrex2-bijou/merlin_199233573_1df7dc3b-a331-4680-a23a-87b33f4d54b4-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "chartreuse, gin, vermouth, christmas, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 157}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice", "1 ounce dry gin, such as Plymouth", "1 ounce sweet vermouth", "3/4 ounce green Chartreuse", "1 to 2 dashes orange bitters", "Maraschino cherry, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a mixing glass or a cocktail shaker with ice, and add the gin, vermouth, Chartreuse and bitters.
