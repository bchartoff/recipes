For this savory fruit salad, a mixture of navel, blood and Cara Cara oranges and a small grapefruit make a colorful display. It\u2019s fine to use just one kind of orange, blood oranges being the classic example. Thinly sliced fennel, celery and red onion add a tasty bit of crunch. The salad is dressed assertively with oil and vinegar, and scattered with olives and flaky sea salt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/01/dining/01KITCH/01KITCH-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, blood orange, cara cara orange, fennel, grapefruit, navel orange, raw, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 251}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 186, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "653 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar", "Salt and pepper", "2 navel oranges", "4 blood oranges", "2 Cara Cara oranges", "1 small grapefruit", "1 small red onion, very thinly sliced", "1 small fennel bulb, very thinly sliced, enough to make 1 cup", "2 or 3 tender inside celery stalks, thinly sliced at an angle", "Handful of olives, black oil cured type or green Castelvetrano type, pitted", "Winter salad leaves, such as radicchio or escarole, optional", "Large pinch of flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the vinaigrette: Whisk together olive oil and vinegar in a small bowl.

First, cut off a thin slice of peel from the top and bottom of the orange, so it can sit flat and securely on the cutting board.
