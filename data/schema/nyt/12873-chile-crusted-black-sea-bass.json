{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chile-Crusted Black Sea Bass", "description": "This recipe came to The Times from the chef Kerry Heffernan, who developed it after an afternoon fishing off Long Island for striped bass but catching black sea bass instead. It was refined in his kitchen in Sag Harbor, then taken back to Brooklyn for further work. It results in fillets of marvelous, flaky simplicity, with a blistering crust that intensifies the sweetness of the fish. White rice and a tangle of saut\u00e9ed greens are excellent accompaniments, along with a glass of bracing white wine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/21/magazine/21eat2/21eat2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "gochujang, sea bass, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 41}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 754, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "91 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "2240 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 whole black sea bass, approximately 2 pounds each, gutted, scaled and trimmed of fins and gills", "3/4 cup kochujang (fermented chile-and-soybean paste, available in many Asian markets and online)", "10 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only, finely minced", "6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "1/3 cup heavy cream (or substitute whole milk)", "4 tablespoons neutral oil (like canola)", "1 1/2 teaspoons red-wine vinegar", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 375.
