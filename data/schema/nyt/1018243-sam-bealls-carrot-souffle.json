{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sam Beall's Carrot Souffl\u00e9", "description": "This is more of a casserole than a traditional souffl\u00e9. It comes from Sam Beall, the proprietor of Blackberry Farm in Tennessee, who died at age 39 in a ski accident. The dish makes its seasonal debut on the Beall family table at Thanksgiving, but paired with a salad, it becomes lunch or a light dinner any time of year. Use the sweetest carrot you can find, and grate the onions on the same grater you use for the cheese to save a little prep and clean-up time. Many of the steps are easy enough for children, making it a great dish for teaching cooking skills. It will become part of your winter rotation, and travels well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/10/dining/10BlackberryRecipe/10BlackberryRecipe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "carrot, cheddar, saltine crackers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 124, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "342 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more to butter the dish", "2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus 1 teaspoon", "1 cup whole milk", "1 cup crushed saltine crackers", "3/4 cup, or about 3 ounces, grated sharp Cheddar", "1/3 cup minced or grated onion (about 1/2 medium onion)", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper", "3 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
