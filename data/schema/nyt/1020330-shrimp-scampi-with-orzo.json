{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp Scampi With Orzo", "description": "The universal appeal of shrimp scampi, frankly, isn\u2019t the shrimp but the pan sauce: garlicky butter lightened with white wine and bursts of lemon, parsley and red-pepper flakes. Scampi is often tossed with pasta or served with crusty bread, but this version instead uses quick-cooking orzo. It simmers directly in the pan sauce, imparting a starchy gloss \u2014 and soaking up the garlicky scampi flavors. Toss the shrimp with some garlic, lemon zest and red-pepper flakes to marinate while the pasta gets a head start on the stove, then simply toss the shrimp on top of the orzo to steam. It all comes together in a flash, and feels effortless. Pair this dish with Caesar salad, steamed broccoli or arugula, or bask in its simple comfort, straight from a spoon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/11/dining/11as-shrimp-scampi-with-orzo/as-shrimp-scampi-with-orzo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, one pot, pastas, seafood", "keywords": "garlic, lemon, olive oil, orzo, shrimp, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3081}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon juice (from 1 lemon)", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup orzo", "1/3 cup dry white wine", "2 cups boiling water, seafood stock or chicken stock", "3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, stir together shrimp, 1 tablespoon olive oil, lemon zest, red-pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and half the garlic.
