She took several approaches: cooking the parts separately, then braising them slowly; simmering ground turkey with pancetta for a rag\u00f9; and this one, where turkey drumsticks are coated in a mixture featuring soy sauce, honey and star anise, then cooked in a 400-degree oven. It\u2019s a worthy weekend meal, or one for a weekday when work gets out early. Pair it with white rice, to sop up the reserved marinade.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/Roasted-Turkey-Drumsticks/Roasted-Turkey-Drumsticks-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course, star anise, turkey drumsticks", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 669, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "64 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "2017 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup tamari or soy sauce", "1/2 cup honey", "1/2 cup dry sherry", "1/2 cup chopped scallions (white and green parts)", "3 tablespoons peeled, grated fresh ginger", "8 whole star anise", "8 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "5 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil", "4 large turkey drumsticks (about 6 pounds)", "1 1/4 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup water, soy sauce, honey, sherry, scallions, ginger, star anise and garlic.
