{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soft-Shell Crab Crostini With Arugula Butter", "description": "For easy weeknight meals, I dry my cleaned crabs thoroughly so they don\u2019t steam, then saut\u00e9 them in plenty of butter or oil. You could use a breading like flour or cornmeal to augment the crunch factor, but it also impedes the sweetness of the meat. And good crabs don\u2019t really need it.\n\nThe trick is to know when to take them off the heat. As soon as they turn from gray-brown to rust and white, the texture goes from soft to taut and they are ready.\n\nSoft-shell crabs don\u2019t need much adornment; a squirt of citrus and some freshly ground black pepper offset the funky sea flavor beautifully. But a little garlic and something green and sprightly (here, a combination of arugula and chives) can make them even better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/20/dining/20APPE_SPAN/20APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings as an appetizer, 2 as a main course", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, arugula, butter, soft-shell crab", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 27}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 303, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "213 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup arugula leaves, stems trimmed", "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon finely chopped chives", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "4 soft-shell crabs, cleaned and patted dry", "4 half-inch-thick slices country-style bread"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Finely chop 1/4 cup of the arugula.
