Wright\u2019s book \u201cMediterranean Vegetables,\u201d this is another Italian recipe for winter squash (or pumpkin, to Italians), this time from the southern region of Apulia. It\u2019s a delicious contrast of sweet and savory. Serve it as a side dish, toss it with pasta or use it as a topping for squash blini. The seasoning is provided by the anchovies, capers and cheese, a salty contrast to the sweet squash (the recipe is not for you if you cannot eat salt).
