{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Swordfish Kebabs With Golden Raisin Chimichurri", "description": "Swordfish is the perfect seafood for grilling \u2014 the flesh is sturdy and firm, with a mild flavor that readily absorbs the aroma of smoke without losing its own. Most people grill swordfish as steaks; the Miami chef Michael Schwartz cuts it into chunks for kebabs, a format that allows him to intersperse the chunks of fish with lemon slices and bay leaves, and grills them over wood (though you could use charcoal or, if necessary, grill over gas). The tips of the bay leaves char, imparting a fragrant herbal smoke. By way of a sauce, Mr. Schwartz serves a classic Argentine chimichurri with a not-so-classic twist \u2014 the addition of yellow raisins, which counter the traditional garlic and vinegar with an unexpected note of sweetness. If swordfish is unavailable, use another sturdy fish, like tuna or mako shark.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/04/dining/04woodrex1/merlin_139044030_30031ba4-0ee5-4767-b821-c6cb1b2fb6f6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, skewers and kebabs", "keywords": "main course, oregano, parsley, raisins, swordfish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 28}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 905, "unsaturatedFatContent": "54 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "69 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "47 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1012 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds swordfish steaks (at least 1 1/2 inches thick), skinned and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "12 bay leaves (preferably fresh)", "2 lemons, halved lengthwise and then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices, seeds removed, plus 1 whole lemon for squeezing", "Coarse sea salt and ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup golden raisins", "1 cup boiling water", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, washed, shaken dry and stemmed", "1/4 cup stemmed fresh oregano", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "3 tablespoons sherry vinegar, or to taste", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the kebabs: Thread the swordfish, bay leaves and lemon slices alternately onto flat bamboo or metal skewers.
