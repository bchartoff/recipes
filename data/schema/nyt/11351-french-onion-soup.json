{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "French Onion Soup", "description": "The onion soup originates from the French cookbook \u201cGastronomie Pratique,\u201d which was written in 1907 by Henri Babinski. The Times published the recipe in 1974, when the book was first translated into English.\n\nIt is a strange recipe for soup that yields delicious results. Baguette toasts are spread with butter and layered with grated cheese, saut\u00e9ed onions and tomato pur\u00e9e. Then, in what seems to be a nod to stone soup, salted water is gently poured in. The dish is then simmered and baked, and by the time it is done, the \u201csoup\u201d is like a savory bread pudding and the top has a thick, golden crust that your guests will fight to the death over.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/21/dining/Gratin/Gratin-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, cheese, onion, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 341}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 589, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "1103 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 baguette, cut into 1/2-inch slices (about 25 to 30)", "9 tablespoons butter, softened", "9 ounces Emmental cheese, finely grated", "8 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced (about 12 cups)", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1 cup tomato pur\u00e9e"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toast the baguette slices and let them cool.
