{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Libyan Aharaimi (Fish in Tomato Sauce)", "description": "Traditionally this Libyan Jewish dish is made with tomato paste, water and fish steaks, and served on holidays like Rosh Hashana. This twist on the classic uses the last of the summer tomatoes, reducing their pur\u00e9e into a thick, concentrated gravy. A few added spices make for a tangy sauce in which to poach sea bass or other fish fillets. Be careful to cook the fish just until slightly firm and flaky to ensure it stays tender. Serve it as an appetizer, as Libyans do, or as a main course. A simple bulgur pilaf makes a nice accompaniment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/16Roshrex/merlin_160015893_b3822410-838a-4573-b62c-4848c684d5e8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 main course servings or 8 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bell pepper, fish fillets, lemon, sea bass, tomato, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large red bell peppers", "3 pounds fresh tomatoes", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium yellow or white onion, diced", "6 to 7 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon finely chopped small red chile, like cayenne, habanero or Scotch bonnet", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground caraway", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar (optional)", "2 pounds skinless sea bass, black cod, halibut or bonito fillets, cut into 8 portions", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "2 lemons, quartered", "Harissa paste, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
