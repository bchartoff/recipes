{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Bean Salad", "description": "You can use any kind or combination of canned beans to make this classic picnic salad, but a mix of white beans, chickpeas and red kidney beans makes it especially colorful. Although this is delicious when freshly made, it gets even better as it sits. If you have time, make it at least an hour or two before serving; it can rest at room temperature for up to 4 hours \u2014 but after that, slip it into the fridge. If you want to make this the day before, add the celery and parsley just before serving, so they stay crisp and green.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/MC-Three-Bean-Salad-15SALADREX/MC-Three-Bean-Salad-15SALADREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, beans, salads and dressings, main course, side dish", "keywords": "apple cider vinegar, cannellini beans, celery, chickpea, red kidney beans, shallot, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 153}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 small shallots (or 1 large shallot), peeled", "3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1 (15-ounce) can cannellini or Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed", "1 (15-ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed", "1/2 cup thinly sliced celery", "1 cup mixed coarsely chopped fresh parsley and celery leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mince 1 shallot and place in a large bowl.
