{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Salmon Escabeche", "description": "This recipe yields both tender salmon and crisp skin, while also solving for salmon\u2019s tendency to stick and fall apart on the grill. First, cooking the salmon skin-side down the whole time protects its delicate flesh from the intense heat and gets the skin so browned that it minimizes sticking. Then, once it\u2019s cooked most of the way through, the fish is transferred to a dish of quick-pickled fennel. Just the flesh is submerged in the brine so it cooks, while the skin above the liquid remains potato-chip crisp. This utilizes the age-old technique of escabeche, in which fish, meat or vegetables \u201ccook\u201d in a sauce of vinegar, oil and seasonings. Feel free to add coriander seeds, onion or other flavorings you like in your pickled vegetables. Serve the salmon and fennel with grilled bread, boiled potatoes, a salad or mayonnaise.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/24/dining/28grillingrex6-WEB/merlin_189645936_4856f363-f87b-4938-a44b-7bf2493a3227-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, main course", "keywords": "fennel, salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 215}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6- to 8-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets", "1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (from about 4 limes)", "1/4 cup apple cider vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons sugar", "1/2 medium fennel bulb, bulb and stalks thinly sliced, fronds chopped (about 8 ounces)", "4 fresh thyme or oregano sprigs or bay leaves", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a charcoal grill for two-zone cooking over medium-high heat by pouring the coals onto one half of the grill.
