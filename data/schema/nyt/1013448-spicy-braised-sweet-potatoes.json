Bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 30 to 40 minutes until the potatoes are tender and the sauce thick. Taste and adjust salt. If the sauce is still watery once the sweet potatoes are thoroughly cooked, do not adjust salt right away. Carefully remove the sweet potatoes to a platter using tongs.
