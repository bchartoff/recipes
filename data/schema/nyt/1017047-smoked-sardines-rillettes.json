{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoked Sardines Rillettes", "description": "Canned smoked sardines are easy to come by, and if you eat fish (especially if you are trying to find ways to eat more fatty fish because of their high omega-3 values), they should be a staple in your pantry. Look for Pacific sardines, which are a Best Choice on the <a href=\"http://www.seafoodwatch.org/\">Monterey Aquarium Seafood Watch list.</a> (Atlantic and Mediterranean are poor choices.)  Like the <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017043-lentils-with-smoked-trout-rilletes\">other rillettes posted</a> on this week\u2019s Recipes for Health, you can use these as a spread for bread or crackers, or as a filling for peppers or endive leaves or cherry tomatoes. The rillettes also go well with lentils, like the smoked trout rillettes featured earlier this week. The cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is optional but recommended (you could substitute olive oil or yogurt); I like the way it loosens and enriches the mixture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/06/science/13recipehealth/13recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 1 cup, serving 6", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low-carb, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 78}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 115, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "94 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces (usually 2 cans) smoked sardines in olive oil, drained and filleted", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "4 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (optional; can substitute yogurt or olive oil)", "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (to taste)", "1 to 2 tablespoons minced chives (to taste)", "Freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, break up sardines and mash with fork.
