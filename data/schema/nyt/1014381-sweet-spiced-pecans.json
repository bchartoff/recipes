{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Spiced Pecans", "description": "The spicing level is fairly forgiving on these pecans, which make a wonderful gift for the holidays or party snack. You can add more cayenne for heat or a little more sugar if you want them sweeter. The key points, though, are making sure they toast well but don't burn and using really good pecans, like Elliots from Georgia, which are stubbier and sweeter than the bigger, skinnier pecans that come from Texas and other Southwestern states (though they are delicious, too.) Ordering bulk pecans online helps keep the cost down.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/05/dining/05swaprex1/05swaprex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "appetizer, brown sugar, pecan, spices, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 135}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 336, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "115 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoons black pepper", "3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon", "2 tablespoons light brown sugar", "5 tablespoons butter, melted", "6 cups pecan halves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
