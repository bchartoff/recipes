{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tuna Mushroom Burgers", "description": "I have always had a weakness for tuna burgers, and I like these even more than the classic all-fish burger because the mushrooms assure a moist texture. They are inspired by a recipe by Clifford Pleau, which was presented at the 2015 Worlds of Healthy Flavors conference. If you use sushi-grade tuna for these burgers you might want to just sear them on each side to get a rare, sushi-like interior. If you use ahi tuna, you could still cook them rare, or cook them for about 2 minutes on each side. This will produce a burger that is more well done but still nice and moist. The burgers are delicious either way. Don\u2019t use a food processor to chop the tuna; finely chop with a knife or a cleaver. The texture will be too pasty if you use a food processor. I found that the punch of the wasabi paste dissipated when the burgers were cooked, so add more if desired.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/04/science/recipehealthburger/recipehealthburger-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers, vegetables", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 122, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "371 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 ounces sushi grade or ahi tuna, trimmed of blood lines", "10 ounces <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017259-roasted-mushroom-base\">roasted mushroom mix</a>", "1 to 2 teaspoons wasabi paste (more to taste)", "2 tablespoons capers, coarsely chopped if desired", "Salt to taste", "black pepper to taste", "1 small shallot, finely minced", "Oil for the pan (no more than 1 tablespoon)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chop tuna very fine.
