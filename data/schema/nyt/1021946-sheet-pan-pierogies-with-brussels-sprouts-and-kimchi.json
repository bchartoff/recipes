{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Pierogies With Brussels Sprouts and Kimchi", "description": "This sheet-pan dinner is a sure win in under an hour, with your oven doing most of the heavy lifting. Roasting pierogies yields a crisp, golden skin with a soft, pillowy interior but, if you don\u2019t have pierogies, you could use gnocchi in their place. (No pre-cooking required!) Cooking kimchi at high heat may feel like a surprising move, but it becomes sticky and caramelized, imparting lots of flavor and texture to the final dish. Finally, a dill sour cream adds a fresh richness, but feel free to swap out the sour cream and use a good-quality Greek yogurt, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or even buttermilk (it will be runnier, so no need to thin with water).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/02/dining/hm-sheet-pan-pierogis/merlin_183955263_eba0aa22-2b2d-4fde-b4a8-6762528cd623-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, weeknight, dumplings, main course", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, dill, kimchi, pierogis, sheet-pan, sour cream, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2054}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved", "1 1/2 cups cabbage kimchi", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 (13-ounce) packages fresh or frozen cheese or potato pierogies (no need to thaw)", "1/2 small lemon, for serving", "Handful of chopped dill, for serving", "3/4 cup sour cream", "1/4 cup chopped dill", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat oven to 400 degrees.
