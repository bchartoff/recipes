{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate-Peanut Butter Bundt Cake", "description": "This cake version of a peanut butter cup boasts moist devil\u2019s food cake wrapped around a soft, peanut buttery cake core. The peanut butter cake batter will stay nicely centered if you enlist the help of a resealable plastic bag or pastry bag to pipe it into a ring in the middle of the batter, but you don\u2019t need to be so exacting. If that feels too fancy, spooning it in will yield equally delicious results. The cake is nicely sweet on its own, but take it over the top by adding peanut butter and chocolate glazes. Keep the glazes thin so that they\u2019re fluid enough not only to evenly coat the surface and run own the sides of the cake, but also so they combine and marble together to make Instagram-worthy swirls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/13/dining/em-pb-cake/em-pb-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "One 10-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "brown sugar, buttermilk, chocolate, cocoa, cream cheese, heavy cream, peanut butter, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 91}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/180 grams smooth peanut butter (not natural)", "1/2 cup/115 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/75 grams light or dark brown sugar", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 cup/95 grams unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for dusting the pan", "1 cup/240 milliliters boiling water", "1 cup/240 milliliters cold buttermilk", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters neutral oil, like vegetable or canola", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy cream, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup/60 grams smooth peanut butter (not natural)", "1/2 cup/60 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters heavy cream", "1/3 cup/55 grams chopped bar semisweet chocolate"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the peanut butter filling: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the peanut butter, cream cheese and brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the egg and vanilla and mix on medium speed until fully incorporated.
