{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eastern North Carolina Fish Stew", "description": "This quick-cooking fish stew, with its raft of eggs and no-stir preparation method, is specific to eastern North Carolina. Church fund-raisers and family gatherings center on the stew, where traditionally men would layer chunks of fish with bones and skin, thinly sliced potatoes, onions and spices in a caldron and stand around the fire watching it cook. About five minutes before it was done, someone would crack an egg for each guest into the tomato-rich broth. Eggs were a cheap filler and a way to stretch the stew to provide enough protein for a crowd, along with fish like striped bass or flounder from North Carolina\u2019s Atlantic shore. Vivian Howard, who left New York to open Chef & the Farmer, a restaurant in Kinston, N.C., offers this version for home cooks. The key is not stirring it at all, and watching the heat so the bottom doesn\u2019t scorch. Serve it with a couple of slices of squishy white bread (Sunbeam is traditional), which act as delicious sponges for the broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/18/dining/18HOWARD-slide-MD1K/18HOWARD-slide-MD1K-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, soups and stews", "keywords": "bacon, egg, fish steaks, potato, white bread, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 85}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 454, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "928 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound sliced smoked bacon", "1 6-ounce can tomato paste", "3 pounds white or red potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds", "2 pounds yellow onions, peeled, halved and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "3 pounds fish steaks (about 6 steaks) around 1-inch thick, with bones and skin intact (striped bass, salmon, red drum, rockfish or sheepshead are good options)", "2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoons chile flakes", "3 bay leaves", "12 eggs", "1 loaf white bread (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the bacon slices into 1-inch squares.
