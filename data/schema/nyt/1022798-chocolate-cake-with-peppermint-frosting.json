The generous swoop of fluffy peppermint buttercream frosting makes it a festive treat. A bit of optional red food coloring gives the frosting those classic peppermint candy stripes, and you can dress the cake up even more with sprinkles and shaved chocolate for a special occasion. The oil in the cake makes it extra moist, and it keeps well on the counter for a few days \u2014 if it lasts that long.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/22/dining/ya-chocolate-cake-with-peppermint-frosting1/merlin_217071231_09c52af1-dcb1-456b-89c6-52ed9821ad40-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 8-by-8-inch square or 9-inch round cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "butter, cocoa powder, make-ahead, one bowl, peppermint extract, sugar, christmas, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 813}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/105 grams grapeseed or other neutral oil, plus more for pan", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 (8-ounce/227-gram) container sour cream", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "3/4 cup/68 grams Dutch process cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy", "1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon instant espresso powder", "1/4 cup/55 grams hot water", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, softened", "2 cups/200 grams sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 teaspoons heavy cream or milk, plus more if needed", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon peppermint extract, plus more if desired", "Pinch kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "Red gel food coloring (optional)", "Shaved chocolate and sprinkles, for decorating (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees.
