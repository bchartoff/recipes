{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Cheesecake", "description": "This dessert delivers all the warm spices of pumpkin pie along with the tangy creaminess of cheesecake. To help the filling come together easily, make sure your ingredients are at room temperature, and refrain from mixing on high, which will incorporate too much air, causing the cheesecake to rise, then fall. The cake is finished in the oven with the heat turned off; that gentle reduction in heat eliminates the need for a water bath and reduces the likelihood of cracks or a grainy texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/09/dining/ya-pumpkin-cheesecake/ya-pumpkin-cheesecake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch cheesecake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "cheesecake, cream cheese, graham cracker crumbs, plan-ahead, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, pumpkin spice, christmas, thanksgiving, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 979}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "2 cups/235 grams finely crushed graham cracker crumbs (from about 15 whole crackers)", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "Dash of kosher salt", "3 (8-ounce/225-gram) packages full-fat cream cheese (not whipped), at room temperature", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/240 grams canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "4 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream, cold", "2 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Fresh nutmeg, for grating"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
