{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Air-Fryer Broccoli", "description": "Broccoli roasts beautifully in the air fryer, and in record time with minimal effort. The air fryer is especially adept at producing the Maillard reaction \u2014 the chemical processes that transform sugars and proteins in food when browned and caramelized, deepening their flavor \u2014 because the controlled, high heat draws out moisture, creating a lovely char while keeping vegetables tender and flavorful. This recipe gives the broccoli a hit of umami from soy sauce, which is bolstered in the high heat, resulting in nutty, sweet and salty notes. If you\u2019d like more umami, a drizzle of fish sauce or chile crisp will stretch these flavors even further.\u00a0 A sprinkle of sesame seeds adds nuttiness, and some fresh lemon zest provides a\u00a0 jolt of brightness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eleanore Park"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/02/dining/ep-air-fryer-broccoli/merlin_215733819_1e00aa8a-8fb3-4a37-a8a9-30cd5558a635-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, quick, weeknight, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "air fryer, broccoli, healthy, soy sauce, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 180}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 small broccoli heads (1 scant pound), florets cut into 1\u00a0 \u00bd- to 2-inch pieces", "2 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 1/2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 lemon wedge, for squeezing", "Lemon zest, sesame seeds, fish sauce, chile crisp or chile oil, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-fryer/'>air fryer</a> to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the broccoli to a medium bowl, along with any tiny stray pieces from the cutting board (they will get crunchy and browned).
