{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Beans", "description": "The key to tender, not-mushy beans is to cook them at the barest simmer, which means they\u2019re perfect candidates for the slow cooker. And the same principles for cooking beans on the stovetop apply: Skip soaking the beans; use flavorings to infuse the beans and the bean-cooking liquid; and salt before and after cooking. You can follow this formula for almost any dried bean, but know that the cook time will vary based on the age and type of bean, as well as the size and strength of your slow cooker. Start checking at the six-hour mark to see how quickly your beans are cooking. Keep flavorings in fairly large pieces, as the long cook time could turn smaller bits to mush.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/15/dining/as-slow-cooker-beans/merlin_201238974_58306119-e10f-4b87-83fd-012d594b6d14-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10H", "recipeYield": "About 6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "beans", "keywords": "olive oil, salt, slow cooker, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 487}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried beans (except red kidney beans; see Tip)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "Optional flavorings (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 5-quart or larger slow cooker, add the beans, olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and your selection of flavorings.
