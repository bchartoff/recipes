{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot French Onion Soup With Porcini Mushrooms", "description": "This version of the classic French soup simmers and bakes in a Dutch oven, while the toast broils right on top. Dried porcini mushrooms, fresh fennel and leeks provide deep umami flavor. Unless you have homemade beef stock on hand, go with a good chicken stock rather than boxed beef stock, which tastes mostly of salt. You could opt for vegetable stock for a vegetarian version, but skip the demi-glace, in that case. The preparation of this soup is time-consuming, but the flavor is well worth the effort. You can make the soup through Step 5 up to two days ahead of time. When ready to serve, reheat on the stove then continue with the final baking step for a hearty communal feast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/27/dining/ss-dutch-oven-onion-soup/ss-dutch-oven-onion-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, fall, winter, fennel, gruy\u00e8re, leek, mushroom, onion, porcini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 569}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 620, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1798 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "4 large yellow onions (about 3 1/2 pounds), halved and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 large fennel bulb, trimmed, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise", "1 large or 2 small leeks, trimmed, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 cup dry white wine", "2 large fresh thyme sprigs", "1 fresh or dried bay leaf", "2 quarts homemade beef stock or store-bought chicken stock", "1 to 2 tablespoons veal, beef or chicken demi-glace or stock concentrate (optional)", "6 (3/4-inch-thick) slices sourdough, peasant or other good-quality bread (about 8 ounces), toasted", "1 1/2 cups grated Gruy\u00e8re (about 4 ounces)", "3/4 cup grated Parmesan (about 2 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a small saucepan with about 2 1/2 cups water to a boil over high and place mushrooms in 2-cup glass measuring cup.
