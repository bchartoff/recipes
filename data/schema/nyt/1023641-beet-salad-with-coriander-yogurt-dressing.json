If your oven is already on, throw in some beets wrapped in foil, and roast them until tender. But if you are pressed for time, grab some store-bought cooked beets. They\u2019ll work just as well. This salad is all about big forkfuls of vegetables; the plump chickpeas, which are suffused with warm coriander and bright orange zest, lend a delightful crunch. It\u2019s all finished with a creamy yogurt dressing you\u2019ll want to drizzle over everything on your plate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/09komolaferex1-beet/merlin_215733927_2f76a145-a50c-46e4-b8ce-b09a0460c7c3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "arugula, beet, chickpea, greek yogurt, salad, fall, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 651}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (15 1/2-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 orange", "1/4 cup full-fat Greek yogurt", "3 tablespoons rice vinegar", "2 pounds cooked whole red or golden beets (store-bought or homemade), peeled and cut into \u00bd-inch-thick rounds", "3 cups baby arugula"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
