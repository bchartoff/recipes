The son of a Bergen County, N.J., contractor, he grew up accompanying his father to jobs on weekends. Stopping for bagels was part of the ritual. After moving to California, he worked for two years at Saul\u2019s Restaurant and Delicatessen in Berkeley, where he became fascinated with baking. He began baking bagels in his apartment and eventually won an account with his former employer. There are all kinds of bagels; Mr. Graf\u2019s has a chewy bite and an almost pretzel-like crust. This is his recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/16/dining/baron-bagels/baron-bagels-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT1H", "recipeYield": "10 bagels", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads, project", "keywords": "appetizer, bread flour, yeast, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 291}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 218, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1096 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon/3 grams active dry yeast", "5 cups/600 grams bread flour", "3 tablespoons/54 grams sea salt, divided", "1 tablespoon/8 grams diastatic malt powder", "2 tablespoons/40 grams baking soda", "1/4 cup poppy seeds, optional", "1/4 cup sesame seeds, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the yeast in the bowl of a standing mixer.
