{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Chicken Curry With Cashews", "description": "This Sri Lankan curry goes together fairly quickly despite the long list of ingredients. I used skinless, boneless thigh meat, because it always stays moist and can absorb a lot of flavor from a short marinade in ginger, garlic and spices. To intensify the taste, the cashews and coconut are used two ways. First, a handful of each is ground to a powder and added to the sauce. Then after simmering for 30 minutes or so, the curry is finished with a generous cup of thick coconut milk and garnished with toasted cashews.\n\nI also added, because I like it and thought it would harmonize nicely, a totally nontropical vegetable, parsnip \u2014 optional, but delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/09/dining/09KITCH_SPAN/09KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken thigh, coconut, spices, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 969}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 637, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "902 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut in 3-inch chunks", "Salt and pepper", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "2 teaspoons grated garlic", "1/4 teaspoon cloves", "1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds", "1/4 teaspoon cardamom seeds", "1/4 teaspoon allspice berries", "1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1/4 teaspoon coriander seeds", "1/4 teaspoon turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne, or more to taste", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "3/4 cup raw cashews", "1/4 cup shredded dried unsweetened coconut", "1 pound small parsnips, peeled and cut in 2-inch batons, optional", "2 tablespoons ghee, coconut oil or vegetable oil", "1 1/2 cups finely diced onion", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 2-inch piece cinnamon stick", "3 cups chicken broth or water", "1 cup thick coconut milk", "A few sprigs mint and cilantro for garnish, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken generously with salt and pepper and put it in a mixing bowl.
