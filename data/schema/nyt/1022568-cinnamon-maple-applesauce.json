Sure, this very basic version is perfect for tender palates, but it also works as the base for many a sweet treat. In the fall you might try swapping in 1 1/2 pounds of pears for half of the apples and a bit of caramel in place of the maple. (Omit the maple syrup if serving with savory foods.) In the summer, swap out some of the apples for red plums for a tangy and a beautifully pink variation that\u2019s lovely served over vanilla ice cream. Add a bit of grated ginger and a few plump medjool dates to make a sophisticated pur\u00e9e that would be nice with some whipped cream or even a pork chop. Make extra, as it doubles easily and freezes well, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/16/dining/ss-Cinnamon-Maple-Applesauce/merlin_194651862_8ef1d3e8-d0a7-46ae-ba36-4e311a83fd56-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "apple, cinnamon, maple syrup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 375}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds apples, peeled, cored, and chopped into 2-inch chunks, both tart and sweet varieties like Granny Smith, Gala and Pink Lady", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "2 tablespoons maple syrup, plus more as needed", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Pinch of kosher salt (about 1/8 teaspoon)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large heavy-bottomed pot, combine apples, lemon juice, 1/2 cup water, maple syrup and cinnamon, cover, and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the apples have softened, around 15 minutes.
