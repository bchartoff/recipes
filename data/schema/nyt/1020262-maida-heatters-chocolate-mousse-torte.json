Her toil was worth the trouble: Eight months later, it was named the paper\u2019s <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/01/21/99113021.html?pageNumber=291\">most requested dessert recipe of the year</a>. This is an adaptation of the version that appears in Ms. Heatter\u2019s book \u201cHappiness is Baking\u201d (Little, Brown, 2019). It begins with a big batch of chocolate mousse, half of which is baked in a pie plate. As it cools, it sinks in the middle, creating a dense, fudgy cake with a bit of an elevated edge. The remaining mousse is piled in the center, then topped with snowy whipped cream and chocolate shavings. One note: Like most traditional mousses, this one contains raw eggs. Use the best pasteurized eggs you can find.

(Another way of applying the whipped cream: Use a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tube and pipe a lattice pattern over the top of the pie and a border around the edge.) Coarsely grate some semisweet chocolate over the top before serving, if desired. The torte is best eaten the day it\u2019s made, but it\u2019s not bad the next day."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020262-maida-heatters-chocolate-mousse-torte"}
