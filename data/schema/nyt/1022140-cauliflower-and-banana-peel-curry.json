{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cauliflower and Banana Peel Curry", "description": "Although one may assume banana peels are the star of the show, they\u2019re minor players in this flavor-packed production, adapted from \u201cCook, Eat, Repeat\u201d by Nigella Lawson (Vintage Digital, 2020). It all hinges on the performance of a concentrated paste made with shallots, ginger, garlic and a red chile of your choice. This mixture forms the base of an intensely aromatic sauce that would make anything taste good. Feel free to swap out the banana skins for their surprising doppelg\u00e4nger, eggplant, and the cauliflower for broccoli, potato or parsnip. Prep makes up the bulk of the work in this recipe; the curry itself comes together in under 30 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Charlotte Druckman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/12/dining/10bananarex1/11bananarex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, curries, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "banana, cauliflower, coconut milk, turmeric, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 418}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large banana peels, tough stems and bottom ends trimmed", "1 small cauliflower and tender leaves, trimmed into bite-size florets (about 5 cups)", "1 1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric", "Fine salt", "1/4 pound shallots (about 2 to 3 large shallots), peeled and roughly chopped", "1 (1 1/2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced into thick coins", "1 fresh red chile (such as bird\u2019s-eye or Fresno), quartered", "4 fat garlic cloves", "1 small bunch cilantro, stems separated and reserved, leaves chopped", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (13-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons flaky sea salt, plus more to taste", "Cooked rice or flatbread (such as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017747-meera-sodhas-naan\">naan</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020906-roti\">roti</a>), for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a full boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the banana peels in a medium-large heatproof bowl.
