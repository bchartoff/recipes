Boneless short ribs are easier to serve to a crowd and can be substituted pound for pound in your grandmother\u2019s time-honored brisket recipe.\n\nBone-in short ribs require a very large pot and are somewhat more awkward to plate. The upside is that they have even more flavor because the marrow that seeps out of the bones seasons the sauce.\n\nYou can buy them either cut across the bone, called flanken, or along the bones, often called English style \u2014 the way it is done in fancy restaurants. You\u2019ll need about three-quarters of a pound of bone-in short ribs per person. If you cook the beef the day before and chill it overnight, you\u2019ll be able to lift off much of the fat that hardens on top of the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/04/dining/04APPE/04APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beef, short ribs, white wine, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 470}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 pounds bone-in short ribs, rinsed and patted dry", "Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 to 5 tablespoons olive oil, more as needed", "8 shallots, 6 finely chopped, 2 thinly sliced", "6 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "3 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, chopped", "2 celery ribs, finely chopped (save leaves for garnish)", "1 (750-milliliter) bottle white wine, not too dry", "2 cups chicken broth, preferably homemade", "1 cup dry vermouth", "6 fresh thyme sprigs", "1 small bunch fresh parsley, stems separated (save leaves for garnish)", "1 fresh rosemary sprig", "3 medium carrots, diced", "1/4 cup white wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons honey", "Flaky sea salt, for garnish (optional)", "1 small bunch chives, roughly chopped", "1 small bunch fresh mint, leaves roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If you have time, the night before or several hours before cooking, season the meat generously with the salt and pepper (you will need at least a tablespoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper).
