Think of this recipe as your blank canvas: You could add thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms at the end, or replace the katsuobushi entirely with dried shiitakes for a vegan version. Fried tofu, clams and even chicken are all fair game when cooking miso soup at home. The chef Seiji Ando, of Benkay restaurant in Portland, Maine, adds sake and mirin for balance, and says even a tiny bit of butter can be delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/18/magazine/18mag-eat/18mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, lunch, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "bonito flake, kombu, mirin, miso, sake, scallion, silken tofu, soup, wakame", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 473}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (5-inch) square kombu (dried kelp)", "1 tablespoon sake", "1 tablespoon mirin", "5 grams wakame (dried seaweed), crushed (1/4 cup)", "2 cups loosely packed katsuobushi (often labeled \u201cbonito flakes\u201d)", "1 (14-ounce) package silken tofu, drained", "1/4 cup miso (white or red; see Tip), plus more to taste", "1 large scallion, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make dashi, the soup base, by soaking kombu in 4 cups cold water for 15 minutes in a medium pot.
