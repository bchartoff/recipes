The fluffy rice is infused with fragrant spices and studded with toasted nuts and dried fruit for a vibrant and textured jeweled look. The onion layers and rice can be prepared a day ahead and kept refrigerated. These festive onions are a great accompaniment to any large protein roast (fish, chicken, steak) and make for a stunning vegetarian main dish. Use any mix of preferred chopped dried fruit; apricots, dates and currants are all nice alternatives.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/14/dining/14sidesgiving-stuffedonion/merlin_196269894_6525ecea-2921-4792-b6ef-8d4c033a9519-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "almond, onion, saffron, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 703}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "3 large yellow onions (2 pounds), ends trimmed and peeled", "1/4 cup sliced almonds", "1/2 teaspoon loosely packed saffron, crumbled", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 cup basmati rice, rinsed until water runs clear", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for seasoning", "1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/8 teaspoon ground green cardamom", "1/4 cup shelled salted pistachios, chopped", "2 tablespoons golden raisins, chopped", "2 tablespoons dried tart cherries, chopped", "1/4 cup chopped parsley, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high.
