{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Extra-Creamy Scrambled Eggs", "description": "Adding a small amount of a starchy slurry to scrambled eggs \u2014 a technique learned from Mandy Lee of the food blog Lady & Pups \u2014 prevents them from setting up too firmly, resulting in eggs that stay tender and moist, whether you like them soft-, medium- or hard-scrambled. Potato or tapioca starch is active at slightly lower temperatures than cornstarch and will produce a slightly more tender scramble, but cornstarch works just fine if it\u2019s what you\u2019ve got on hand. Make sure your skillet is at just the right temperature by heating a tablespoon of water in the skillet and waiting for it to evaporate. For creamier eggs, you can replace the water with milk or half-and-half.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
