During Victorian times, savories were served at the end of the meal, after dessert. But over time these delightfully named foods were more of a snack, or served as part of a lighter lunch or brunch. Traditionally, this savory is grilled by placing the wrapped prunes under a hot broiler, turning as necessary, until the bacon is crisp. This may be done, but they preferred the oven method.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "16 devils on horseback", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, bacon, prune, toast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 12}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 165, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "242 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["16 pitted prunes", "About 2 tablespoons hot chutney", "8 slices lean bacon", "16 rectangles buttered toast (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017643-buttered-toast\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to high (500 to 525 degrees)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stuff each prune with an equal portion of hot chutney."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut each slice of bacon crosswise in half.
