{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Bundt Cake With Maple Brown-Butter Glaze", "description": "Bundt cakes are classic showstoppers \u2014 big, lofty and usually dressed in elegant drizzles and drips of glaze. Here, a dense, moist cake full of warm fall spices and pumpkin pur\u00e9e is encased in a layer of rich, nutty brown-butter maple glaze. Feel free to make it a day before you plan to serve it: This cake keeps well at room temperature, and you might think it's even better on the second day. Just make sure to keep it covered  and resist the urge to shave off a slice every time you walk by. If you can find it, use organic confectioners' sugar for the glaze. It's made from raw sugar and uses tapioca rather than cornstarch as its anticaking agent. It will give the glaze a richer taste and smoother texture than conventional confectioners\u2019 sugar \u2014 a tip picked up from Stella Parks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/28/dining/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2/28COOKING-PUMPKINBUNDTCAKE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 972}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 516, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "77 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "372 milligrams", "sugarContent": "49 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/384 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 cups/440 grams light brown sugar, packed", "1/2 cup/114 grams unsalted butter, soft but cool", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 (15-ounce) can/425 grams pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "1/2 cup sour cream", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup/102 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar (preferably organic), sifted", "1/4 cup maple syrup", "Pinch of salt", "1 to 2 tablespoons lightly toasted pepitas (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12-cup (or larger) capacity bundt pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, allspice and black pepper until well combined."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine brown sugar, butter and olive oil.
