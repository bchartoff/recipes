This one came from Ernest Hemingway, who explained: \u201cThis was arrived at by the author and three officers of H.M.S. Danae after having spent seven hours overboard trying to get Capt. Bra Saunders\u2019 fishing boat off a bank where she had gone with us in a N.W. gale.\u201d Even under less dramatic circumstances, it\u2019s a drink that packs a punch. Pastis is often substituted for the absinthe, but if you want to be as Hemingwayesque as possible, stick to the original specs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/26/magazine/26death-afternoon/26death-afternoon-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "absinthe, champagne", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 50}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 oz. absinthe", "Very cold Champagne"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour absinthe into a coupe or flute.
