{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Taj\u00edn Grilled Chicken", "description": "Taj\u00edn is a Mexican seasoning made from dried, ground red chiles, sea salt and dehydrated lime juice. It is great sprinkled over fresh cut fruit like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022134-mango-with-chile-lime-salt\n\">mango</a> and pineapple, or rimmed on an ice cold margarita. But it is also an easy way to add chile and lime to your favorite grilled meats, rubs or sauces. In this dish, the lime in the Taj\u00edn balances out the sweetness from the agave syrup, while the red chiles complement the smoky flavor of the chipotles. Serve the chicken as is or on toasted hamburger buns with a schmear of mayonnaise, chopped grilled scallions, cilantro leaves and sliced pickled jalape\u00f1os. This Taj\u00edn sauce also would pair well with grilled bass, cod or salmon, or with shrimp skewers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
