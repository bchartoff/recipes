{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Flattened Chicken Thighs With Roasted Lemon Slices", "description": "An easy, superfragrant weeknight version of classic chicken under a brick, this recipe uses chicken thighs instead of a butterflied whole bird. Lavish quantities of lemon, garlic and fresh herbs season the flesh, and the skin gets shatteringly crisp and salty.\u00a0This recipe makes great use of a cast-iron skillet (or two) and is a great dish to cook when seasoning a new pan because of the large amount of fat that melts into the pan. (You pour it off before serving.) If you have a pan that is large enough to fit all the thighs, you can cook them in one batch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/29/dining/29CASTIRON-WEB6/29CASTIRON-WEB6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 9 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken thighs, sage, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1167}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 454, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "510 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 lemons, rinsed", "1/4 cup fresh thyme or oregano leaves", "1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves", "1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley", "10 to 12 medium or large garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "1 teaspoon red chile flakes", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "9 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, rinsed in cold water", "18 fresh sage leaves", "3 to 4 large garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced (to yield 18 slices)", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 lemons, rinsed", "Fresh thyme or oregano sprigs, for garnish\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the marinade: Use a vegetable peeler to shave 9 large strips of peel from the lemons, taking care to cut into only the brightest yellow outer layer.
