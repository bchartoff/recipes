After the coals turn a powdery gray-red, put a pan of water on top of the coals to catch the grease. Put the brisket on the grill over the water, and cover. Baste brisket with wet mop every half-hour for first 2 hours and once an hour after that. The longer you cook it the better the texture. At Carolina it is cooked for 24 hours; it needs at least 15 hours. Replenish charcoal and water regularly. The brisket is cooked when the meat registers 150 degrees on a meat thermometer."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "While meat cooks, make the sauce. In a large heavy skillet over medium heat cook onion in olive oil until translucent. Add remaining ingredients except vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar. When brisket is cooked, slice it thin and serve with sauce."}]}
