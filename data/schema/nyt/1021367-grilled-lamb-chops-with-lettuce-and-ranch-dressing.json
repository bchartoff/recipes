{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Lamb Chops With Lettuce and Ranch Dressing", "description": "Cooking lamb chops hot and fast keeps them juicy and perfectly pink inside. Here, they\u2019re first marinated in an herby garlic paste, then grilled or broiled and served with crisp lettuce hearts and a tangy ranch dressing (made from more of that same herb garlic paste). Quick and easy enough for a weeknight, these chops are also always an impressive meal to serve to guests. You\u2019ll probably have some ranch dressing left over. It will keep for a week in the fridge and is also excellent as a sauce for grilled chicken, or as a dip for vegetables and crackers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/19/dining/14apperex/merlin_175275612_c0fbd17c-d7b0-43cd-ab6f-73eb44aab0ea-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, meat, main course", "keywords": "basil, buttermilk, lamb chops, mint, parsley, romaine, fourth of july, labor day, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 399}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced, plus more for serving", "1/3 cup fresh basil leaves, packed", "3 packed tablespoons chopped mint, dill, cilantro or a combination", "2 packed tablespoons chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 garlic cloves, finely grated or mashed to a paste", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "3/4 cup mayonnaise", "1/2 cup buttermilk, or use 1/4 cup each milk and plain yogurt", "1 lemon, cut into wedges", "2 pounds bone-in lamb chops, about 1-inch thick (any cut)", "Romaine lettuce hearts, large leaves torn and small ones left whole, for serving", "Sliced radishes, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a blender or mini food processor, combine half the scallions, the herbs, 2 tablespoons olive oil, a pinch of salt and a lot of pepper.
