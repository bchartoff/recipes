If you don\u2019t have pinto beans on hand, use black or mayocoba beans for equally delicious results. Top this dish with quick-pickled red onion, which tastes even better if you make it the day before. For a perfect weeknight meal, garnish with a dollop of sour cream, avocado slices, and a sprinkle of toasted pepitas and cilantro leaves.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/23/dining/JR-enfrijoladas-pintos/merlin_193269189_34d0a981-e8b7-4f70-b6a0-87c375ea60d8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "avocado, pinto beans, tortilla, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 440}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1/2 cup lemon juice", "1/4 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 dried bay leaf", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt", "Pinch black pepper", "1 whole dried chipotle morita or meco chile", "1 3/4 to 2 cups drained pinto beans, from 1 (15-ounce) can or homemade", "1 1/4 to 3 cups vegetable broth or bean cooking liquid", "Kosher salt", "4 tablespoons neutral-flavored oil, plus more as needed", "12 corn tortillas", "4 tablespoons sour cream, vegan if you\u2019d like", "4 tablespoons roasted salted pepitas", "1/4 cup cilantro leaves", "2 ripe medium Hass avocados, pitted, peeled and sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pickled onion: Combine the onion, lemon juice, oregano, red-pepper flakes, bay leaf, salt and pepper in a medium bowl and mix.
