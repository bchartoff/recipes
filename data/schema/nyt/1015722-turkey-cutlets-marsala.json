Jill Norman beautifully reanimated it in her 2010 book \u201cAt Elizabeth David\u2019s Table\u201d and we took it along ever so slightly in the name of ease: lightly browned cutlets in a sauce of Marsala wine. The cooking is gentle, and takes little time. It pairs nicely with a mushroom risotto or a pile of rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/magazine/24eat-copy/24eat-copy-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick", "keywords": "main course, marsala, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 201}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 turkey cutlets, approximately 1 \u00bc pounds", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Flour for dusting", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup Marsala wine", "1/4 cup chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season cutlets aggressively with salt and pepper, then lightly dust them with flour."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a large saut\u00e9 or frying pan set over medium-high heat, and when it begins to foam, add the turkey cutlets to the pan.
