{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sambal Tumis", "description": "The traditional way to make sambal is to grind chiles and other ingredients with a mortar and pestle, as my mother, Rosni Pattilllo, did. The process is said to release intense heat and bold flavors. But my mom now uses a food processor, which works just fine. There are more than 300 varieties of sambal, each serving its own purpose: as a dip, marinade, soup base or condiment. This version uses belacan (sometimes spelled \u201cbelachan\u201d or \u201cblachen\u201d), a pungent, hardened block of shrimp paste that adds depth to the sambal. (You can leave it out if you prefer, or can't find it.) Sambal tumis (slow-stirring) is a versatile stir-fried chile paste used in dishes like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019458-mee-goreng-southeast-asian-fried-noodles\">mee goreng (fried noodles)</a>, sambal udang (shrimp), sambal telur (eggs) and nasi goreng (fried rice). You can store freshly made sambal tumis in the refrigerator for up to one week and in the freezer for up to 3 months. If you prefer a milder sambal, decrease the number of chiles or use milder ones; for a spicier version, increase the number of chiles or leave in seeds from some or all of the chiles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Natalie Pattillo"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/15/dining/15Sambalrex1/merlin_142135845_e4a77587-414e-43b1-904a-cd8fd1557708-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "asian, indonesian, malaysian", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "lemongrass, red chiles, serrano pepper, thai chile", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 224, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "276 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 dried anchovies, each roughly 2 inches long", "4 to 6 dried red chiles (any variety is fine, except for chipotles, which are smoked)", "3 to 5 Thai bird chiles", "3 to 4 red chiles (such as Fresno or red Serrano)", "1/2 tablespoon belacan (shrimp paste)", "4 small round shallots or 2 regular supermarket shallots (about 3 ounces), diced", "6 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 tomato, diced", "2/3 cup canola oil, plus more if necessary", "1 tablespoon tamarind paste", "2 lemongrass stalks, tough outer layers removed and inner stalks smashed", "Kosher salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the anchovies in a bowl of cold water and soak for 5 minutes.
