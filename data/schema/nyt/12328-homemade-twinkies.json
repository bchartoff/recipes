{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Homemade Twinkies", "description": "Dispirited by the possible demise in 2012 of Hostess, the company that makes Twinkies, Ho Hos, and Hostess cupcakes, Jennifer Steinhauer began to wonder if she could make Hostess snack cakes, as well as other much-loved junk food from the past, in her own kitchen. She started with this classic, the Twinkie, by buying a canoe pan, which conveniently came with a cream injector. This recipe is a traditional sponge cake-style recipe, with whipped egg whites and sugar forming the base, then filled by cream injector with seven-minute frosting. Neighbors were delighted when she shared the results, but it was short lived. By the next day, the cake had absorbed the cream -- so make sure to eat them fast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jennifer Steinhauer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/28/dining/twinkies-still/twinkies-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "12 homemade Twinkies.", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, eggs, flour, marshmallow fluff, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 55}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 273, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "115 milligrams", "sugarContent": "28 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray or vegetable oil", "60 grams (1/2 cup) cake flour", "30 grams (1/4 cup) all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons milk", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "5 large eggs at room temperature, separated", "12 tablespoons sugar", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "165 grams (1 1/2 cups) confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 cup Marshmallow Fluff", "2 tablespoons heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the cakes: Heat the oven to 350 degrees and adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make single-use Twinkie molds, cut 12 pieces of aluminum foil 12 inches wide by 14 inches long.
