{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jambon Beurre", "description": "Unlike ham and cheese, a sandwich that\u2019s ubiquitous across the globe, jambon beurre (ham butter) is strictly French. Though it\u2019s a seemingly sparse construction \u2014 simply baguette, cooked ham and butter \u2014 the ingredients for this interpretation from L\u2019Ami Pierre in New York require careful selection. High-quality baguettes are now sold in many bakeries. High-butterfat butter enhances the sandwich, providing more fat than 80 percent supermarket standard, and the ham, preferably silky jambon de Paris, a cooked ham sliced, in the finer shops, from a bone-in joint, can make it or break it. French-style or similar cooked ham is available in many areas; to avoid are boneless, often waterlogged deli hams. Like most sandwiches, this one is designed as a treat for one, but, cut into smaller sections and served on a platter, it can enhance a buffet, even at holiday time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/30/dining/28Jambonrex/28Jambonrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for one, lunch, quick, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "baguette, ham, unsalted butter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 309}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (10-inch) section fresh baguette", "1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter (preferably 85 percent butterfat), softened", "4 ounces thinly sliced cooked ham, preferably jambon de Paris or prosciutto cotto, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 275 degrees.
