{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Roasted Salmon With Jalape\u00f1o", "description": "Here is a simple, easy preparation for salmon that allows wild-caught fish, especially, to shine. The foaming butter amplifies the richness of the flesh, while the jalape\u00f1os keep it in check, as soy sauce does to the fattiest sushi. Some prefer to reverse the order of the cooking, so that the fish is served skin-side up, but I find that cooking it this way allows the butter to do its job more effectively and delivers a more beautiful plate of food as well. (Most of it is left in the pan when you\u2019re done.) Top with chopped fresh herbs, and serve with roasted new potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/09/magazine/09eat/09eat-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butter, jalape\u00f1o, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 611}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 554, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "46 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "451 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 5-to-6-ounce fillets of salmon, ideally wild-caught, 1/2-to-1-inch thick", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, like grapeseed or canola", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 medium jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded and diced fine, approximately 2 tablespoons (or to taste)", "1-2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, mint or flat-leaf parsley, or a combination of all three"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat fillets dry with a paper towel.
