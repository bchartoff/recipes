Silken tofu, cashews and banana make it extra creamy, while lemon juice and orange zest provide the tang you\u2019d normally get from cream cheese. (Be sure to soak the cashews long enough; you want them to completely disappear into the batter upon blending.) This dessert can be made in a pie dish or a springform pan, but if you make it in a pie dish, keep an eye on the crust as it bakes; tent the cheesecake with foil if the edges are getting too brown.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/dining/vegan-pumpkin-cheesecake/merlin_163201941_ecf7a99b-6b14-4bd5-b06c-e009ed4224ef-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, pies and tarts", "keywords": "banana, cashew, coconut oil, margarine, pecan, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, soy milk, tofu, dairy-free, kosher, vegan, vegetarian, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 243}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs (made from 10 ounces of whole graham crackers)", "3 tablespoons sugar", "4 tablespoons melted nonhydrogenated margarine, melted coconut oil or canola oil", "1 tablespoon plain soy milk or almond milk", "1/2 cup whole unroasted cashews, soaked in water for 2 to 8 hours, or until very soft", "1/4 cup mashed banana (about 1 medium-size banana)", "1 (12- to 14-ounce) package silken tofu, drained", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/3 cup dark brown sugar", "3 tablespoons coconut oil, room temperature", "6 teaspoons cornstarch", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "2 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon orange extract or 1 teaspoon grated orange zest", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/4 cups canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/3 cup brown sugar", "1 tablespoon nonhydrogenated margarine", "Pinch of salt", "1 cup pecan pieces, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the crust", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and lightly spray a 9-inch pie plate or springform pan with nonstick cooking spray."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and sugar.
