{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coq au Vin With Prunes", "description": "The standard <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018529-coq-au-vin\">coq au vin</a>, even when it is made with shortcuts, is a hearty dish, what with its bacon, garlic, deep red wine and enrichment of butter. But the one I like best is made with prunes: it's darker, richer, fuller, the kind of recipe one adores and makes repeatedly. The prunes melt into the wine and become barely recognizable, bringing even more depth, not only of color but of flavor. Despite its relative ease of preparation, this becomes a serious dish, the kind that demands plenty of bread so that you can linger over the juices. Feel free to play with variations here: saut\u00e9 some sliced button mushrooms, a dozen or more peeled pearl onions or whole cloves of garlic (but don't omit the chopped onions) in the skillet after you've cooked the bacon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, prune, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 78}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 922, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "82 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "46 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1206 milligrams", "sugarContent": "46 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 chicken, cut into serving pieces", "Salt and pepper", "2 medium onions, chopped", "1/2 cup salt pork or bacon, minced (optional)", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 pound pitted prunes", "2 cups Burgundy, pinot noir or other fruity red wine", "2 tablespoons butter, optional\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "Minced parsley for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, and turn heat to medium-high.
