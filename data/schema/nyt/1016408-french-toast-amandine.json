They asked: \u201cCouldn\u2019t we do something similar with French toast? And make it, like, sweet?\u201d We certainly could, and we did: a simple breakfast fry-up made elegant and well groomed. Fry the slices up in good butter, and serve them with maple syrup or a slash of jam. Pile everything in the sink afterward and boogie; you can clean up later.
