{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crab Rangoon", "description": "The irresistible combo of crispy, fried egg noodle encasing molten cream cheese has made this snack a finger food mainstay. Though it has roots in mid-century Polynesian-style bars and restaurants, the imitation crab stick-filled fried wonton has been adopted by many American Chinese menus. The chef-consultant Eric Ehler designed the menu at Lazy Susan, a Chinese takeout spot in San Francisco; for his version of the classic dish, he uses Dungeness crab meat and adds scallions and lemon zest for color. As a child, Mr. Ehler loved to dip the fried wontons in egg drop soup, or use them as a scoop for rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Cathy Erway"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/23/dining/21takeoutrex3/merlin_188667807_656368ba-66fc-4c77-bc96-1b68418f3cf2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "42 to 50 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "american, chinese", "recipeCategory": "dumplings, finger foods, appetizer", "keywords": "crab, cream cheese, scallion, wonton wrappers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 249}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese", "3 tablespoons sliced scallion greens", "1/2 lemon, zested", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cups/7.5 ounces lump crab meat (preferably Dungeness, or substitute with imitation crab)", "1 (12-ounce) package yellow square (about 3 1/2-inch) wonton wrappers (about 50)", "All-purpose flour, for dusting", "3 quarts rice bran or canola oil", "1/2 cup ketchup", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the cream cheese from its packaging, set it in a large bowl and let it soften at room temperature for at least 1 hour."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dipping sauce, if desired: Stir the ketchup, sugar and rice vinegar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and bring it just to a boil, whisking until the sugar dissolves.

To make a simple rangoon, fold the wrapper into a triangle by pulling one corner to its opposite corner, pressing out any air and sealing the wonton shut. To make a star-shaped rangoon, lift the left and right corners underneath between your index fingers and thumbs, and lift them up toward the center, pinching your index fingers and thumbs along the seams to fold each tip as you do it, so that a four-pointed star shape forms.
