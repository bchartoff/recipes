{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Francese", "description": "Chicken francese, sometimes called chicken French, is one of those rare restaurant dishes that's truly easy to cook at home. If you can make chicken cutlets, you can make this lemony, buttery recipe; the only difference is an easy pan sauce that brightens the whole plate. This version includes lemon slices browned in butter, which are pretty and tasty but entirely optional. Although the name suggests that it's a French or Italian dish (\"Francese\" means French in Italian), it's actually neither: Like spaghetti and meatballs, it's a mostly Italian-American invention. Serve with something starchy to soak up every drop of the sauce; pasta is traditional.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/dining/26Chickenrex1/merlin_143907327_92230702-6892-4887-8d5c-5083c94d907b-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "chicken breast, dry white wine, lemon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3454}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1129, "unsaturatedFatContent": "54 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "79 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "66 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "383 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 eggs", "2 tablespoons whole milk", "1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup olive oil", "1/3 cup vegetable oil", "4 to 6 large boneless, skinless chicken cutlets (buy the cutlets thinly sliced, or buy regular boneless breasts and slice them in half horizontally to make thin pieces)", "3 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 lemon, thinly sliced, seeds removed (optional)", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "Freshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon, more to taste", "2 cups chicken stock", "3 to 4 tablespoons freshly minced parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk eggs, milk, salt and pepper until blended.
