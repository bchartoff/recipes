{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Farro With Crispy Mushrooms and Sour Cream", "description": "Similar in texture to a risotto (without\u00a0the constant stirring), this creamy, saucy farro is about half the work, with almost no technique required. While the porridgelike texture is a delight all on its own,\u00a0the meaty, golden brown mushrooms and frizzled leeks are the real reason you are here. Using plenty of olive oil to make sure the mushrooms crisp and brown without\u00a0sticking will be the secret to\u00a0success in that department.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/15/dining/13Romanrex/merlin_166853004_056d5354-de14-4f10-a8fb-520e2d02e6e0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice", "keywords": "farro, leek, mushroom, sour cream, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1090}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil, plus more as needed", "4 medium leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced", "1 pound mix of mushrooms, such as maitake, oyster, cremini or chanterelle, torn into bite-size pieces (about 5 cups)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 3/4 cups pearled or semi-pearled farro or barley", "4 cups vegetable broth or chicken broth", "1/2 cup finely chopped chives (from about 1 bunch)", "1 cup fresh dill leaves, coarsely chopped", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for squeezing", "Sour cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
