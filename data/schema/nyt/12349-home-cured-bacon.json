{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Home-Cured Bacon", "description": "Pink salt, also known as curing salt No. 1, is a nitrate, a combination of sodium chloride \u2014 table salt \u2014 and nitrite, a preserving agent used to deter the growth of bacteria in cured meats. Bacon is cured in the refrigerator, then slow roasted, and finally cooked again before serving. It is not being consumed as a raw, cured meat, so the use of a nitrate is a personal decision. A small amount of pink salt in your cure provides that familiar pink color and bacon-y flavor, or what we have come to know as bacon-y. It is absolutely possible to cure bacon without nitrates; but be aware that the end product will be more the color of cooked pork and that the flavor will be akin to that of a pork roast. With or without the pink salt, homemade bacon is worth the effort.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Cathy Barrow"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/28/dining/curedbacon-still/curedbacon-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 2 pounds", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 341, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "163 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds pork belly, squared off, rind removed", "2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon pink salt, optional", "1/4 cup maple syrup, or honey, brown sugar, white sugar or molasses", "2 tablespoons cold strong black coffee, bourbon or apple cider", "2 garlic cloves, smashed", "1 tablespoon black peppercorns, crushed", "2 teaspoons fresh thyme", "1 teaspoon fennel seed, toasted", "1 teaspoon coriander seed, toasted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the pork belly in a large Ziploc bag.
