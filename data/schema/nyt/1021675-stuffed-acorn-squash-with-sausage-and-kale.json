{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffed Acorn Squash With Sausage and Kale", "description": "This recipe dresses up the humble acorn squash for a dinner that\u2019s a hearty and comforting celebration of fall flavors. Feel free to tweak the recipe to use what you have on hand: Any leftover rice or cooked grains will work, along with spinach or other sturdy greens in place of the kale. Though this is not a recipe for rushed weeknights, the squash can be assembled completely in advance and finished in the oven just before serving. For best results, use medium squash, and remove the stem for easier cutting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/19/dining/lh-acorn-squash/merlin_179660823_1e80366f-bfe1-430e-ac5e-cc186faaf83d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, sausages, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "acorn squash, hazelnut, kale, sausage, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 442}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium acorn squash (about 2 pounds each)", "Olive oil, as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup raw hazelnuts, for serving (optional)", "1 cup chopped shallots (about 4 shallots)", "1/4 packed\u00a0cup chopped fresh sage leaves", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 cup lightly packed chopped lacinato or curly kale leaves", "1 pound bulk hot Italian pork sausage", "Generous pinch of ground nutmeg", "1/2 cup dry white wine, such as sauvignon blanc", "1 cup cooked white or brown rice, or farro", "1/3 cup grated Parmesan", "Chopped fresh parsley, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
