Use cold water to soak the seeds, and after pur\u00e9eing, taste your mustard. You can smooth it out with a little honey, or up the zip with horseradish or chiles. Either way, your mustard will mellow out after a few days in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/28/dining/mustard-still/mustard-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "One and 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "mustard seed, white wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 121}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 116, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "127 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup brown mustard seeds", "1/4 cup yellow mustard seeds", "1/2 cup white wine", "1 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place mustard seeds in a medium-size  bowl.
