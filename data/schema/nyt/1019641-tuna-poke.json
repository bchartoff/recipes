{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tuna Poke", "description": "This is a dish that comes from Long Island, New York, not the Big Island of Hawaii, a Northeastern take on a Pacific classic. I\u2019ve made it with Atlantic bonito caught offshore and yellowfin tuna bought at the market, the meat trimmed, cubed and mixed with sesame oil and soy sauce, a little chile-garlic sauce and lot of chopped scallions. I top the salad with roasted macadamia nuts and a few vigorous shakes of furikake, a Japanese seasoning that is made of sesame seeds, dried fish and seaweed, salt and sugar. It makes for about the most delicious eating in the world.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/14/magazine/14mag-eat-image1/14mag-eat-image1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings for dinner; 8 to 10 as an appetizer", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, mirin, scallion, sesame oil, sesame seeds, sushi-grade tuna", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 396}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 170, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "493 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds sushi-quality tuna loin, thick-cut", "1 small red onion, peeled and sliced very thin", "4 scallions, trimmed and both green and white sections thinly sliced", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 teaspoon mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)", "1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce, or to taste", "1 1/2 tablespoons furikake (a dry Japanese seasoning made of a mixture of dried fish and seaweed, sesame seeds, salt, sugar and other ingredients) or sesame seeds, or to taste", "1 cup roasted macadamia nuts, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Carefully cut the tuna, against the grain, into thick planks of 3/4 inch, and then into 3/4-inch cubes.
