{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Easy No-Yeast Monkey Bread", "description": "Many monkey bread recipes are made with a yeast-risen dough, but the most classic methods use biscuit dough, as this one does. A quick fold of the dough ensures it\u2019s light and fluffy inside. When you grease the pan, you may worry that two tablespoons of butter seems excessive, but the generous amount prevents the monkey bread from sticking to the pan and combines with the cinnamon sugar to create an effortless caramel sauce as it bakes. If you\u2019re looking for an even simpler approach, you could replace the homemade dough with about two pounds of store-bought refrigerated biscuit dough.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/30/dining/ejm-monkey-bread/merlin_168100557_1d405ebc-3241-4a56-a7fb-3cc0767acabc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch round or 10-inch bundt loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, finger foods, one pot, quick breads, dessert", "keywords": "butter, buttermilk, cinnamon, flour, heavy cream, vanilla, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 433}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/510 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 cup/225 grams cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 1/3 cups/320 milliliters cold buttermilk, plus more as needed", "12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), at room temperature", "3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup/220 grams light or dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1 cup/125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "6 tablespoons heavy cream or milk, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the biscuit dough: In a large bowl, whisk the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt to combine.
