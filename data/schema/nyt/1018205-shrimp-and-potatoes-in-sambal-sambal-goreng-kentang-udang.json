{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp and Potatoes in Sambal (Sambal Goreng Kentang Udang)", "description": "If you're seeking seriously intense heat and rich, layered flavors to go along with it, Indonesian sambal will deliver a two-for-one punch. The chef Retno Pratiwi uses a mix of red bell peppers and two kinds of red chiles to form the base of the exquisite, bright red sauce, softening it with a little coconut sugar and brightening it with aromatics. You can reduce the number of chiles or opt for milder ones if you're not looking for a kick. Then use it to cook shrimp, as in this recipe, or to enliven other meats and vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/06/dining/06EIDjp5/06EIDjp5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indonesian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "galangal, lemongrass, makrut lime leaf, Thai chile", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 433, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1253 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes", "2 tablespoons vegetable or other neutral oil", "3 tablespoons coconut oil", "2 red bell peppers, seeded, stemmed and roughly chopped", "10 to 15 Thai bird's-eye chiles, stemmed and roughly chopped", "Kosher salt, to taste", "4 to 6 red chiles (such as red serrano, Fresno or cayenne), stemmed and roughly chopped", "10 small shallots, sliced", "1 small tomato, chopped (or 1 scant cup cherry tomatoes)", "1 tablespoon coconut sugar", "4 lemongrass stalks, trimmed, smashed and tied into knots", "1 2-inch piece galangal, peeled and lightly smashed to loosen the fibers", "10 to 15 fresh makrut (kaffir) lime leaves", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds deveined shrimp (tails left intact)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
