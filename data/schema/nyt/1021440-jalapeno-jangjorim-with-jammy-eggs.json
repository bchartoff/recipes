{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jalape\u00f1o Jangjorim With Jammy Eggs", "description": "Jangjorim is a Korean dish of soy sauce-braised meat, often studded with pulled eye of round (sometimes sold as \u201cjangjorim meat\u201d at Korean grocery stores), hard-boiled eggs and wrinkly kkwarigochu (shishito peppers), which are mild enough to eat whole. This version, inspired by my mother\u2019s recipe, uses eggs that are just boiled enough that they\u2019ll peel easily and the yolks will remain fudgy. In place of the shishitos are fat, juicy jalape\u00f1os, adding a welcome freshness and fruity heat. And the beef is brisket, shredded into long, pleasurably chewy strands, which soak up the umami-rich soy sauce brine. As a banchan, this dish is an ideal accompaniment to a bowl of fresh white rice. Any leftover sauce you might have is a large part of the joy of making jangjorim: It tastes fabulous when soaked into rice with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil, or as a sweet, saline base for soba noodles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/30/dining/28banchanrex1/merlin_177434073_4c7a9612-2947-4fbe-9e2d-d1ee10f1341e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, meat, side dish", "keywords": "beef brisket, garlic, ginger, jalape\u00f1o, small plate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 158}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice, as needed", "5 large eggs", "1 pound beef brisket, cut into 3-inch cubes", "1/2 medium yellow onion, unpeeled", "2 large scallions, halved crosswise", "1 (5-inch) square dasima (dried kelp)", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, unpeeled and thinly sliced", "1 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "3 packed tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon mirin", "4 large jalape\u00f1os, halved lengthwise, deseeded if you don\u2019t like heat", "7 large garlic cloves, peeled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot over high heat, bring 6 cups water to a boil.
