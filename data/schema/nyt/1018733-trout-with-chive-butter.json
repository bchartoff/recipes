{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Trout With Chive Butter", "description": "You can make this speedy dish casual and after-work-friendly or fancy enough for company. It all depends on how you garnish it. Using trout or salmon roe turns it into something quite deluxe, with the small pearls of caviar popping in your mouth. But a sprinkling of saline capers is nearly as delicious, at a fraction of the cost. No matter which you choose, the fish itself a snap to prepare. The butterflied whole trout broils up in under five minutes. After that it's smeared with a garlicky compound butter, which melts into a fragrant, savory sauce. Serve this dish with boiled new potatoes, crusty bread or rice to catch all the buttery juices.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/24/pageoneplus/24A2_video/clark-trout-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "butter, capers, roe, trout, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 147}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 742, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "91 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "1092 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 whole trout, butterflied", "Fine sea salt, to taste", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon or lime juice, more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed and softened", "1 tablespoon minced chives, more for serving", "Trout roe, salmon roe or capers, for serving, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler.
