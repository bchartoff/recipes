{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chewy Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookie Bars", "description": "While most pumpkin cookies skew cakey, these bars are as rich and chewy as the center of a chocolate chip cookie. To counteract the added moisture from the pumpkin pur\u00e9e, this recipe has a few tricks up its sleeve: For starters, it completely ditches the eggs. Browning the butter does double duty, removing water while also giving the dough a deeper flavor with nutty notes. Baking the bars at a low temperature keeps the edges soft, resulting in an impossibly chewy cookie texture with a warm pumpkin spice flavor and pockets of molten chocolate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jesse Szewczyk"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/26/dining/js-chocolate-chip-pumpkin-bars/js-chocolate-chip-pumpkin-bars-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "24 squares (one 9-by-13-inch pan)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bar cookie, chocolate chip cookie, chocolate chips, clove, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, light brown sugar, make-ahead, nutmeg, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, pumpkin spice, fall, halloween", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 941}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks)", "Nonstick cooking spray or neutral oil", "1 3/4 cups/385 grams packed light brown sugar", "3/4 cup/170 grams canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e (not pumpkin pie filling)", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 1/2 cups/9 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small (preferably light-colored) saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
