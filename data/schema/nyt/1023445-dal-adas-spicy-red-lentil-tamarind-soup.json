{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dal Adas (Spicy Red Lentil Tamarind Soup)", "description": "As with all culinary traditions, southern Iranian cuisine has been influenced by the cooking of neighboring regions. Spicy and warming, dal adas is a popular southern Iranian red lentil soup or stew reminiscent of Indian masoor dal. It bursts with flavor from plenty of garlic and spices, and tickles with heat from ground cayenne. The dish is brightened with tamarind, an ingredient commonly used in the south of Iran to add the requisite Iranian tang to dishes. For ease, use tamarind concentrate, which can be found at most Middle Eastern, Asian and Latin markets, plus many supermarkets. Dal adas can be served as a soup, as done here, with a side of flatbread. If you prefer to serve it as a stew over rice, reduce the water amount by about one cup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/06/dining/nd-dal-adas/merlin_212088567_c8f02dc8-a19a-492b-b8ae-9f70eb58a58f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, iranian, red lentils, tamarind, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 318}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons ghee or extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "6 large garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 (2-inch) piece of fresh ginger, finely chopped", "12 fresh cilantro sprigs, leaves set aside for garnish and stems finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne, or to taste", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 cups red lentils, rinsed", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 to 2 tablespoons tamarind paste or lime juice, plus more as needed", "Flatbread or plain white rice (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat the ghee or oil over medium-high.
