Harris wrote a whole cookbook paying tribute to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the Massachusetts resort island where lobsters, oysters and farm-fresh vegetables are abundant. This Southern-style succotash is ideal for summer, when the tomatoes are overflowing. Dr. Harris loves to use okra in the place of beans, which are often an ingredient in succotash dishes. If you can\u2019t find a habanero chile pepper but still want to add heat, a small jalape\u00f1o will work.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nicole Taylor"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/22/dining/22COOKING-SOUTHERNSUCCOTASH2/22COOKING-SOUTHERNSUCCOTASH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "corn, habanero chile, okra, tomato, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 85}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 80, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "542 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound okra, tops and tails trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds", "6 large, ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped (about 3 1/2 pounds)", "2 cups freshly cut corn kernels (from about 2 medium ears)", "1 habanero chile, pricked with a fork (optional)", "Salt and ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine okra and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan.
