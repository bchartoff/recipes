{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Polenta With Mushrooms", "description": "Who knows who first mixed soy sauce and butter and discovered the pleasures the combination provides. Try the mixture on warm white rice, a steaming pile of greens or an old sneaker \u2013 regardless, the taste is a sublime velvet of sweet and salty, along with a kind of pop we call umami, a fifth taste beyond sweet, sour, bitter and salty. Soy butter provides warmth and luxury, elegance without pomp. For this recipe, we\u2019ve adapted a dish that was on the menu at the chef Chris Jaeckle\u2019s All\u2019onda, in Manhattan: a mixture of soy and butter with mushroom stock to pour over polenta and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. The result is a dinner of comfort and joy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/14/dining/07COOKING-POLENTA-MUSHROOMS1/07COOKING-POLENTA-MUSHROOMS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1535}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 382, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "286 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups minus 3 tablespoons whole milk", "1 teaspoon salt, or to taste", "1 3/4 cups polenta or cornmeal", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, or to taste", "1 tablespoon grated Parmesan, or to taste", "1/2 ounce dried porcini mushrooms", "5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pats, divided", "1 clove garlic, peeled and minced", "8 ounces fresh mushrooms, wild or cultivated, sliced thin", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon heavy cream", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the polenta, bring 4 1/2 cups water and the milk to a high simmer in a\nmedium-size heavy saucepan set over medium-high heat.
