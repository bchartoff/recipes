Berries and cream are, of course, a classic combination, but putting them together this way makes for a beguiling dessert. The berries give off a delicious violet juice that is used to soften the ladyfingers, just as strong coffee is used in the traditional recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/14/dining/14UMBRIA-RECIPES3/14UMBRIA-RECIPES3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "berries, dessert wine, egg, ladyfingers, mascarpone, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 71}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 442, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "172 milligrams", "sugarContent": "21 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds/600 to 700 grams mixed berries of your choice (blackberries, strawberries, blueberries or raspberries, fresh or frozen)", "3 to 4 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1/2 cup dry Marsala, Vinsanto or other dessert wine", "3 egg yolks", "6 tablespoons/75 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon dry Marsala, Vinsanto or other dessert wine", "10 ounces/375 grams mascarpone", "1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters chilled whipping cream", "30 to 36 Italian ladyfingers", "2 to 3 tablespoons brown sugar, for dusting", "Edible flowers, for topping (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the berries: Trim berries and cut any large ones into 1/2-inch/1 centimeter pieces.
