Seared scallops are paired with cherry tomatoes that are cooked in white wine and butter until they\u2019re falling apart, and the whole thing is finished with a sprinkle of fresh herbs and lemon zest. Equal parts casual and elegant, this dish is best served straight from the skillet, with a big green salad, a nice loaf of bread and the rest of the wine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/06/dining/lh-scallops-and-jammy-tomatoes/merlin_174968871_71cf6fa3-671a-4780-9414-8d7fcadf779c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "basil, lemon, scallops, tomato, white wine, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2152}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots (about 2 shallots)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 cup dry white wine, such as muscadet or sauvignon blanc", "1 pound cherry tomatoes, cut in half through the stem (about 3 cups tomatoes)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "16 large sea scallops (about 1 pound), tough muscle removed", "2 tablespoons grapeseed oil, plus more as needed", "1 lemon, halved", "Julienned fresh basil and mint, for serving", "Coarse sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-low and add the butter to melt.
