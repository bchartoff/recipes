{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Mushroom Bulgogi Lettuce Wraps", "description": "The savory Korean bulgogi marinade in this recipe is made with pantry items and livens up just about anything you put it on. Here, the soy-scallion-ginger marinade is used on boneless, skinless chicken thighs, but it can also be brushed on tofu, zucchini or bell peppers for a satisfying vegetarian meal. As the meat cooks, the marinade caramelizes into a sweet-salty sticky glaze that coats the chicken. Serving the grilled chicken and vegetables in lettuce cups is a fun way to enjoy the meal. Korean condiments like kimchi and gochujang are traditional bulgogi accompaniments, but shredded cabbage, salsa or even guacamole would also work. Leftovers can be refrigerated overnight, then chopped and tossed with salad greens.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/04/dining/kc-grilled-chicken-bulgogi/merlin_174811089_3a3b363a-cdba-4305-9051-26fdfe889e24-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "boneless chicken thighs, ginger, gochujang, kimchi, mushroom, onion, scallion, soy sauce, dairy-free, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1887}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 cup chopped scallions (about 5 scallions)", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced (2 tablespoons)", "2 teaspoons turbinado sugar", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "3 tablespoons safflower or canola oil, plus more for greasing", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch-thick slices", "2 large yellow onions, peeled and cut into 1-inch wedges", "8 ounces white button mushrooms, halved, or quartered if large", "Lettuce leaves, such as green leaf, butter lettuce or romaine", "Any combination of cooked short-grain rice, kimchi, gochujang or toasted sesame oil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, scallions, garlic, ginger, sugar, pepper and 2 tablespoons oil and mix well.
