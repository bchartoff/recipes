{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tomato Cobbler With Ricotta Biscuits", "description": "Nicole Rucker, the chef at Fiona in Los Angeles, makes biscuits with a particularly tender, cakelike crumb. Her secret: ricotta. Strain the cheese well to get rid of excess moisture, and don\u2019t be afraid to dust the dough with flour as you work, to keep it from getting oversaturated and sticky. The biscuits, baked atop a mix of tomatoes seasoned with sugar and vinegar, rise tall, with soft insides and crunchy, golden crusts. The dish lies somewhere between a savory course and sweet one, and you can serve it either way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/11/magazine/11mag-eat/11mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "butter, buttermilk, cherry tomatoes, ricotta, thyme, dessert, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 901}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup whole-milk ricotta", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams plus 2 tablespoons cake flour, plus more for dusting", "1 tablespoon plus 1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into cubes and chilled", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk, plus 2 tablespoons for brushing", "2 to 2 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes or Sungold tomatoes", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "2 sprigs fresh thyme"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the ricotta: Strain the ricotta in a cheesecloth or fine-mesh strainer for at least 30 minutes.
