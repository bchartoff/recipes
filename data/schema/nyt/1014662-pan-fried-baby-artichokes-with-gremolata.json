{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Fried Baby Artichokes With Gremolata", "description": "Here is an appetizer course to beat the band. Baby artichokes dipped in seasoned flour, fried and served with a gremolata of parsley, garlic, lemon zest, orange zest and capers. Snap off a few of the tough, dark exterior leaves of the little artichokes until the pale green centers are visible. Then cut a half-inch or so off the tops of each artichoke and trim the stem end with a paring knife. Cut them lengthwise into halves or quarters and put them in a bowl of water with a good squeeze of lemon juice to prevent them from turning brown. This can be done an hour or two before cooking. Use olive oil to fry them if you\u2019re feeling extravagant, or a frugal combination of olive and vegetable oils.
