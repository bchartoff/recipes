{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ratatouille Pie", "description": "In this buttery, rustic pie, chunks of eggplant, zucchini and tomato are roasted with olive oil until velvety soft, then covered in a cheesy, mayonnaise-spiked custard. Chopped olives scattered on top cut through the richness and give the whole thing a salty tang. It's the perfect next-day use for ratatouille, should you have some. Use it here instead of roasting the vegetables. You\u2019ll need about 3 to 4 cups (enough to fill the pie crust two-thirds of the way up). You can parbake the crust, roast the vegetables and make the custard the day before, but don\u2019t bake everything together until the day of serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/dining/29appe1-sub/merlin_142593993_9440b6f0-479b-4dd4-abc9-60d9481fc66e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pies and tarts, vegetables", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, eggplant, gruy\u00e8re, zucchini, main course, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 476}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 465, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "566 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into cubes, plus more for buttering foil", "1/3 cup ice water, plus more if needed", "1 large eggplant (about 1 1/2 pounds), cut into 3/4-inch cubes", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "5 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 tablespoon rosemary leaves, chopped", "1 tablespoon thyme leaves", "Kosher salt, as needed", "1 cup cherry tomatoes, cut in half", "1 large white onion, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1 small zucchini or summer squash, cut into 3/4-inch cubes (about 7 ounces)", "1 large egg", "3/4 cup coarsely grated white Cheddar or Gruy\u00e8re", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan", "1/3 cup mayonnaise", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup basil leaves, chopped", "1 small plum tomato, sliced 1/4-inch thick (optional)", "1 tablespoon chopped Moroccan black olives (or other good black olives)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt and sugar to combine.
