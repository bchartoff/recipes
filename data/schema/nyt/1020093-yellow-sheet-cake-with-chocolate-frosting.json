{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Yellow Sheet Cake With Chocolate Frosting", "description": "This is the kind of dessert worth dreaming about: a buttery yellow cake topped with a chocolate-sour cream frosting, made doubly rich with cocoa powder and melted chocolate. The batter may seem thin when you spread it in the pan, but, once baked, it rises to perfection. It\u2019s not a towering, lofty cake \u2014 it\u2019s not meant to be \u2014 but when it\u2019s covered with a generous layer of frosting, it makes for the ideal cake-to-icing ratio. For a perfect cake, make sure designated \u201croom temperature\u201d ingredients truly are; this helps ensure that the batter is fully incorporated so the cake bakes evenly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/11/dining/em-yellow-sheet-cake-with-chocolate-frosting/merlin_151072443_d52e0970-46c3-4ed9-b58f-dcbb1c67b9dc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "chocolate, cocoa, confectioners' sugar, flour, sour cream, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 631}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters whole milk", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 1/2 cups/310 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 cup/45 grams cocoa powder", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters sour cream", "2 ounces/55 grams bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "Sprinkles, for finishing (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly grease a 9-by-13-inch pan with nonstick spray.
