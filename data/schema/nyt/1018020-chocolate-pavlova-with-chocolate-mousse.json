{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Pavlova With Chocolate Mousse", "description": "Most pavlovas are white and fluffy nests filled with whipped cream and fruit. This is a dark and fudgy reinterpretation, with cocoa powder in the meringue and bittersweet chocolate in the mousse on top. What was once billowing and light becomes rich and intense. Because the cocoa powder has a small amount of fat in it, the meringue here will not hold its shape as well as a regular pavlova. So there\u2019s no need to pipe out any fancy designs, which will melt in the oven. Instead, decorate the top with fresh berries or chocolate shavings to create a showstopper of a dessert. You can make the meringue and mousse a day ahead, but don\u2019t assemble the dessert until just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/14/multimedia/clark-pavlova/clark-pavlova-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "australian", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder, eggs, sugar, dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 223}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 802, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "55 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "sodiumContent": "163 milligrams", "sugarContent": "73 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 egg whites, at room temperature (save the yolks for the mousse)", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/4 cup/28 grams unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted", "3 cups/710 milliliters heavy cream", "6 egg yolks", "6 tablespoons/70 grams granulated sugar", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "12 ounces/340 grams bittersweet chocolate, chopped, melted and cooled", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 tablespoon rum", "1 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, lightly whipped", "Fresh berries or chocolate shavings (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pavlova: Heat oven to 250 degrees.
