{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mofongo", "description": "Easily the most popular classic Puerto Rican dish, mofongo is flavorful, satisfying and layered with history. The ingredients and process reference the island\u2019s Indigenous and African roots alongside Spanish flavors. While this preparation uses chicharr\u00f3n or pork cracklings, you can easily make it vegan by omitting the pork and adding a little extra garlic and olive oil. The trick to great mofongo is to work quickly: Heat your garlic and olive oil mojo while your plantains are frying, and smash everything together as soon as they\u2019re done. You can stuff mofongo with seafood or roast pork, if you like, and serve it with guiso, a flavorful, sofrito-scented tomato sauce, or even use it to stuff a Thanksgiving turkey. The included recipe for guiso is optional but recommended, as it adds dimension and moisture, particularly for a vegan preparation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/dining/26resiliencerex3/merlin_177593391_6fdc0429-d428-42f6-b570-75679c3f3431-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "cracklings, garlic, lime, plantain, puerto rican", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 211}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon olive oil", "2 tablespoons fresh sofrito (see\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021438-arroz-con-pollo\">Arroz con Pollo</a> recipe for instructions)", "1 cup tomato sauce (basic canned tomato sauce is fine)", "4 to 6 cups vegetable oil", "3 to 5 large garlic cloves", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus more to taste", "3 green plantains (see Note)", "1 1/2 cups chicharr\u00f3n or pork cracklings, plus more for garnish (optional)", "Lime wedges and cilantro, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the guiso, if using: Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, until simmering.
