It takes time and practice, but it yields dividends. This particular recipe is vastly versatile. It can be made into <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018706-whole-wheat-fettuccine-with-spicy-broccoli-rabe\">whole grain pasta,</a> by swapping in 1 cup sifted whole wheat, spelt or farro flour in place of 1 cup all-purpose or 00 flour. Add more egg yolks or water as needed and rest the dough for 1 hour. Or try a green pasta, as in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018704-ravioli-verdi-with-butter-parmesan-and-pepper\">this ravioli verdi</a>: Steam or saut\u00e9 6 ounces baby spinach (about 6 cups) until just wilted. Spread it out on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and, when cool, squeeze water out thoroughly, a handful at a time, then chop roughly. Pur\u00e9e with 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk, then use this mixture in place of eggs in the recipe. Or, for something a little different, make an herbed pasta, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018705-herbed-pappardelle-with-parsley-and-garlic\">like this pappardelle,</a> by stirring in 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley, chives, chervil, tarragon, or basil in any combination to the eggs before adding to the flour in the main recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/07/dining/07PASTAGUIDE5/07PASTAGUIDE5-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings for cut pasta, 6 to 8 servings for stuffed pasta", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas", "keywords": "eggs, flour, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 326}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 197, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "28 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups 00 or all-purpose flour", "2 large eggs", "3 egg yolks, plus more as needed", "Semolina flour, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mound the flour in the center of a large, wide mixing bowl.
