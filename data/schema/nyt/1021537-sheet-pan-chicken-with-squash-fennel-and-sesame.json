{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Squash, Fennel and Sesame", "description": "This recipe, created with the convenience of sheet pans in mind, has an effortless charm. Crisp-skinned chicken thighs and caramelized butternut squash get smokiness from chipotle and nuttiness from sesame seeds. The sweet flavors of the fennel and squash play off each other, while a generous sprinkling of lime juice adds a hit of acid for contrast. Feel free to swap butternut squash with your favorite fall squash. You can peel it before you cook, but you can also leave the skin on. Once roasted until tender, it\u2019ll release the squash easily when you eat it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/04/dining/ns-chicken-squash/ns-chicken-squash-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, poultry, main course", "keywords": "butternut squash, chicken thighs, chipotle, fennel, sesame seeds, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 409}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large butternut squash, scrubbed (about 3 pounds)", "2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 to 8 thighs)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons lime juice plus 1 lime, cut into wedges", "2 tablespoons ground coriander", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds", "1 tablespoon ground fennel", "1 teaspoon chipotle powder", "Fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro or flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
