My phone's at a weird angle. Hello, New York Times we're making lasagna! Oh my gosh. Why did that just stop recording? Did it never record? Oh, I wonder if my phone's full? Oh well, not it's going oh, ye, ye OK. The tech situation here, it's wild guys. Hi, I'm Samin Nosrat and I'm throwing a big dinner party. It's a big lasagna. I thought it might be kind of fun for us all to cook something together and gather to eat it in our living rooms online in any way possible. We've put together this cooking class lasagna making tutorial. So you can follow along. Gathering, laughing, making a mess. All of us. It's kind of fun. All right. Hello, we're starting our lasagna from zero. Woot, woot! We're just going to make a quick dough. I want to help you get over your fear of making pasta. Use whatever ingredients you can get your hands on at the store, and whatever you've got in your own cupboard. I just want to work eggs into the flour and the flour into the eggs gradually. At some point, it makes sense to forget about the fork and just mix with your hands. And your goal really, at this point is just to incorporate all the flour into the dough That's what you want, really pliable and soft like that. Should have done this in the first place. Look at me in my primary colors. Oh gosh. We will put it in plastic to keep it from drying out and getting a skin on the outside. While that rest, we're going to start our bechamel sauce and start our pasta sauce Let's do our bechamel first, Let's make some bechamel sauce. Half a cup of flour. I believe Roux goes through sort of three visible stages. The first stage is just this very silky mixture You can see at the edges as it's starting to foam. Soon the whole thing is going to be really foamy. This is stage two. Do you see that? The whole thing has turned foamy and it's a little bit lighter in color. Third state now, ready for milk. This is what they say is like wet sand. It did Brown a little bit, but I'll be OK with that. If that happens to you, it's fine. I feel like lasagna is the ultimate comforting food to gather around. It's something that we all know and love. And yet, I think there are a lot of ways to make it even more delicious. Making all of your own sauces. It's a treat and we can all use a treat. Take a look at this. Do you to see it's much thicker? Then I have this little pot preheating for tomato sauce. I really wanted to do this project because I wanted to do something to unify people in a time when we all feel so separate. I live by myself here. And I really miss gatherings. I miss setting the table, inviting people over and making a mess. Like the inevitable moment when I like spill something or do something super silly at the table and everyone just gets a laugh. Thick not running, beautiful. That's going to be so good in the lasagna. All right. So the bechamel is done. One of our four elements out of the way. I think there is a lot of joy in seeing people's faces, even if it's on a screen and sharing meals and having moments. Push that back and then in a minute, I'm geting ready to cook my spinach. I've had a really complicated relationship to technology for me, I've always prioritized in-person interactions, in person celebrations, and have sort of turned my nose up at virtual anything and I have to say, over the last you know month and a half, I've changed my tune a little bit. There is a lot of joy that can come from gathering virtually. All right. I'm going to let that cool. We're going to finish our filling, we're going to roll our pasta, we're going to make our lasagna. Get a lasagna in the oven. You know a dish that symbolizes gathering and comfort and just deliciousness. I insist on chopping things finely. I don't like lasagna to have like big bites of hard stuff in there. Six ounces of mozzarella, just grated. Phone call! Three ounces of parmesan. And then this is that corresponding basil to the stems that I chopped finely. A pinch of salt and just mix to combine. Yum! All right, I'm going to wash my board and get ready to roll pasta. OK, pasta rested. It's a pretty wet pasta. So it's going to need a lot of flour as we roll. I always consider the first two settings a sort of extended kneading before I'm really rolling it thin. This pasta is so wet, like so droopy and wet that I actually mean to sort of work some flour into it And you can't flour just one side. You have to flour both sides. So for the first four settings, I just roll once through because it's really about getting it thinner at this point. As this sheet gets longer and more unwieldy. You take a moment to sort of stack it on itself in a nice, tidy pile so that it's ready to feed itself in when it goes through. This is perfection. I want it to be just about the length of a 9 by 13 and I'm going to be so liberal with the flour because the last thing I want is for these really beautiful delicate sheets of pasta to stick to themselves while they're waiting to be cooked. There we go. Really heavily salt this water. Remember, there was no salt in that pasta dough so this is our only chance to really get it seasoned. Sort of gently lay it. Lay it on top. I want to make sure that each sheet is completely immersed in water on both sides before I add the next sheet. That's going to prevent the flowery bits from sticking together. It's also super important that the water's boiling. Otherwise everything will to sink to the bottom and stick. Beautiful and it's kind of droopy in just the right way. Rinse this under some cold water. So it's like touchable. So I'm going to start by putting a generous amount of this bechamel on here. I really think of that as nonstick lubricant and of course, a source of flavor. I don't need a ton of overlap on all sides and this does not have to be wrapped with the perfect package. But I do think, at least two of the sides having some overlap helps keeping the structure of the lasagna together. Perfectly covered. So now we can start building. So we're going to do ricotta. We're going to do about a third of the total amount. Throwing in some more pasta. So we can cook while we're assembling this next layer. I try to avoid overlap, if I can. Red sauce mix. One thing I want to talk about is salt. You can't really fix a lasagna that's under salted, so individually taste every layer, everything and make sure it's good. If you think there's even a possible possibility that it could used a little more salt, maybe every third or fourth layer do a little salt sprinkle just for good luck. This is kind of fun, but just the best part. This is my favorite part. The only thing better would be if actual humans were coming over to eat this. OK. So this is my last layer before the top. So I'm going to use up to the rest of my red sauce. Remember, we're going to fold this over. I just want to stick to this parchment on here. So that the bechamel sticks to the parchment and not the foil. Very happy. See in 40 minutes. Oh my god, it grew. My baby grew! and now it'll go back into the oven for probably another 15 minutes. Let's check on it. It's beautiful. So it is currently, I would call it at volcanic temperatures. So I'm going to wait probably close to 30 minutes before I cut into it. All right. I said I'd wait 30 minutes. I literally waited three minutes. Oh, god. This is a mistake. It's so hot. Oh my goodness. Do you see this? Do you see all those beautiful layers? Here we go. I'm going to eat a bite. It's like a piece of lava going down my throat. It's honestly so good. Even after I've eaten so many versions of it. I'm going to take one more bite and then I have to stop because I will injure myself. I hope that you get to share this lasagna with a bunch of people. If you're like me, maybe you'll just eat at many meals in a row. I hope I got to teach you something. I invite you to do this crazy project with me. I hope it brings you a little joy and comfort and deliciousness. And come to a big lasagna dinner party altogether. Can't wait to see you there.", "contentUrl": "https://vp.nyt.com/video/2020/05/13/86501_1_SN-Lasagna_wg_240p.mp4"}, "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021031-the-big-lasagna"}
