{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Tea Cake With Meringue", "description": "This beautiful tea cake from the San Francisco chef Elisabeth Prueitt has all the fall flavors of pumpkin spice channeled into a moist, spicy loaf with a base of sweet potato pur\u00e9e. It also has a delicious unusual addition: meringue, baked right into the top of the cake. Ms. Prueitt\u2019s head of pastry at Tartine Manufactory, Michelle Lee, came up with the idea of swirling it over the top of the cake before baking. Use a spoon or toothpick to reach down into the cake batter and pull it up, creating beautiful peaks of batter-streaked meringue that bake up golden brown and crisp on the edges.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/tartine-sweet-potato-tea-cake/tartine-sweet-potato-tea-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "1 9-inch loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, orange juice, sweet potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 136}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound/340 grams sweet potatoes (about 1 medium), peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces", "Unsalted butter, for greasing pan", "3 tablespoons orange juice", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters vegetable oil", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/125 grams granulated sugar", "2/3 cup/125 grams packed brown sugar", "1 1/4 teaspoon sea salt", "3 large eggs", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour", "1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "Pinch of ground cloves", "1 large egg white", "3 tablespoons/30 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
