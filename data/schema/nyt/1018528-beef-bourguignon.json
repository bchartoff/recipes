{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef Bourguignon", "description": "Like coq au vin, its sister dish from the Burgundy region of France, beef Bourguignon is a stew of meat slowly simmered in hearty red wine along with pearl onions, mushrooms and crisp, cubed bacon. Use a good wine here, something simple but drinkable. It makes all the difference in the finished dish. As with all beef stews, this one is best made a day or two ahead; don\u2019t saut\u00e9 the mushrooms and onions until just before serving.
