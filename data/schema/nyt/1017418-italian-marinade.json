{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Italian Marinade", "description": "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017420-spiedies\">Spiedies</a>, grilled skewers of meat marinated in what amounts to Italian dressing, are a culinary mainstay of bars and roadhouses in and around Binghamton, N.Y. What follows is a recipe for the marinade used to prepare them for the fire.\n\nI have used fresh herbs, though dried ones are more traditional, and have upped the flavor slightly with the use of lemon zest. Once you\u2019ve got the marinade made, simply cut the meat \u2014 chicken or beef, lamb or pork \u2014 into 1- or 2-inch cubes, and submerge it in the liquid for a couple of days (10 to 12 hours for chicken), covered, in the refrigerator. All that lemon and vinegar does some work on the meat, and the result, when grilled over charcoal for four or five minutes a side, is a fantastical taste of upstate New York, and a very simple and excellent dinner besides. (Here are <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017420-spiedies\">instructions for cooking them</a>.) Serve with torn mint and an additional drizzle of lemon juice and olive oil, on top of Italian bread or alongside rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20SPIEDIEMARINADE/20SPIEDIEMARINADE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "Enough for 2 to 3 pounds meat", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "bay leaves, garlic, oregano, red wine vinegar, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 168}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 256, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "170 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3/4 cup red wine vinegar", "Zest of 1 lemon", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 2 lemons)", "4 cloves garlic, peeled, smashed and roughly chopped", "1 bay leaf", "1 tablespoon thyme leaves", "1 tablespoon oregano leaves", "1 tablespoon basil leaves, rolled and chopped into chiffonade", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper", "1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together all the ingredients in a large bowl.
