Even better, it has pancetta and anchovies for complexity of flavor, and the whole thing comes together in under an hour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/03/multimedia/clark-skillet-chicken/clark-skillet-chicken-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "one pot", "keywords": "bocconcini, chicken, pancetta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2110}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1246, "unsaturatedFatContent": "53 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "91 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "93 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "sodiumContent": "1618 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 pounds bone-in chicken pieces (or use a 3 1/2 pound chicken cut into 8 pieces)", "2  teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "5 ounces pancetta, diced", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 anchovy fillets", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1 (28-ounce) can whole plum tomatoes", "1 large basil sprig, plus more chopped basil for serving", "8 ounces bocconcini, halved (or use mozzarella cut into 3/4-inch pieces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
