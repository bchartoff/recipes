{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Albacore With Yogurt-Dill Sauce on a Bed of Arugula", "description": "This is based on a recipe for red mullet from \u201cClassic Turkish Cooking\u201d by Ghillie Basan. Red mullet isn\u2019t so easy to come by in the United States, and albacore works well here. In the authentic Turkish dish, the red mullet is marinated in a mixture of onion juice and lemon juice with bay leaf. This step is optional; it tenderizes the fish and adds terrific flavor, but grilled albacore is nice enough on its own. Dill is the traditional herb for this recipe, but mint is very nice as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/27/science/26recipehealth/26recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "turkish", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "albacore tuna, arugula, greek style yogurt, healthy, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 6}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 401, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "931 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large onions", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "4 bay leaves, broken up", "4 albacore steaks, about 6 ounces each", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if the fish has been marinated)", "2 garlic cloves, halved, green shoots removed", "Generous pinch of salt", "1/2 cup thick Greek-style or drained yogurt", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "2 to 4 tablespoons finely chopped dill or mint", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "1 bag baby arugula, preferably the wild variety"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If marinating the fish: Quarter the onions and place in a food processor fitted with the steel blade.
