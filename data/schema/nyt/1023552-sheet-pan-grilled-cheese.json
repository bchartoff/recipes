{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Grilled Cheese", "description": "Ever dream of serving warm grilled cheese sandwiches to a crowd without feeling like a short-order line cook or getting stuck with a slightly soggy sandwich? A sheet pan can help: It allows you to cook four sandwiches at once, with less attention than they require on the stovetop, and provides the opportunity to add cheese to the outsides for a crisp, chip-like contrast to the gooey filling. This oven technique is amenable to different kinds of breads and cheeses, and can take additions for melts. Grilled cheese just got even more convenient.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/09/dining/as-sheet-pan-grilled-cheese/merlin_215057859_5f62eff6-48b7-40c4-b4ee-db28f5ba4d46-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "butter, cheese, gruy\u00e8re, parmesan, sharp cheddar cheese, sheet-pan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 477}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup unsalted or salted butter, for greasing", "8 slices sandwich bread, no more than 1/2-inch thick", "1 to 1 1/2 cups (4 to 6 ounces) grated or 4 to 8 slices melting cheese, such as sharp Cheddar, American or pepper Jack, depending on size of bread", "1/2 cup (about 2 ounces) grated hard cheese, such as Parmesan, Asiago or Gruy\u00e8re (or more sharp Cheddar)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat the oven to 400 degrees.
