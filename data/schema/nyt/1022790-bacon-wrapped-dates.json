{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bacon-Wrapped Dates", "description": "A bacon-wrapped date is sweet, smoky, squidgy and crisp, all in one bite-size package. The trick is getting the bacon to cook before the date burns, and you can do that by starting in a cold oven so that the bacon slowly renders its fat and evenly crisps. While this appetizer was en vogue in the 1970s and 1980s, it has never gone out of style. In fact, it dates back to Victorian England, when bacon-wrapped oysters or prunes (also known as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2559-angels-on-horseback\">angels</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2560-devils-on-horseback\">devils</a> on horseback) were eaten before or after a meal. (\u201cHorseback\u201d referred to their being served on toast.) Sometimes the prunes were soaked in tea or liqueur, and stuffed with chutney, cheese, or nuts. You can do the same if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/30/dining/as-bacon-wrapped-dates/merlin_195006537_a4509806-6b97-4373-8018-2cc0acff846a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "16 dates", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, appetizer", "keywords": "bacon, dates, christmas, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 408}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 slices bacon", "16 medium Medjool dates, pitted", "Black pepper (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using scissors, cut each slice of bacon in half crosswise at a diagonal, like cutting ribbon.
