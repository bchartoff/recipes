Next, you heat up some oil in a skillet and fry the potatoes until they\u2019re nice and brown on their flat sides. Each potato is then crisp and caramelized but still moist inside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/18/dining/potato-tostones/potato-tostones-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 487}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 135, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "356 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds small potatoes (about 20), like Yukon gold", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "Olive oil", "Coarse sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a steamer basket in a large pot filled with an inch of water and add the potatoes and salt.
