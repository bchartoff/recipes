{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro Risotto With Sweet Corn and Tomatoes", "description": "Here\u2019s a heartier, whole-grain alternative to traditional risotto that doesn\u2019t require as much attention or stirring. Pearled farro is a must for this recipe; the tough husks have been removed so the grains cook in less time. The farro simmers in a quick homemade corn stock that makes use of the leftover corn cobs and imparts a rich corn flavor. Finally, fresh tarragon gives this risotto a lot of personality, but basil would be a fresh substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/22/dining/lh-farro-risotto-with-sweet-corn-and-cherry-tomatoes/lh-farro-risotto-with-sweet-corn-and-cherry-tomatoes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, vegetables", "keywords": "corn, farro, leek, lemon, parmesan, tarragon, tomato, white wine, fall, summer, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 418}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ears fresh corn, husks and silk removed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 cups thinly sliced leeks, white and light green parts (1 to 2 leeks)", "1 1/2 cups pearled farro (see Tip)", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1 cup cherry tomatoes (about 6 ounces), halved", "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 2 ounces)", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon or basil", "1 teaspoon lemon zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a sharp knife, cut the corn kernels off the cob, cutting as close to the cob as possible.
