{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Torta Ahogada", "description": "Torta ahogada, which translates to drowned sandwich, is a staple across Guadalajara, Mexico. Birote salado is the bread typically used for this stuffed, smothered sandwich, partly because its salty sourdough flavor complements the fillings, but mostly because its crunchy exterior stands up well to ladles of hot salsa. If you\u2019re not able to get your hands on birote salado, you can substitute bolillo or a French baguette. The options for fillings are endless, and this version with creamy pur\u00e9ed pinto beans is ideal for a meatless meal. If you happen to have mushrooms, you can saut\u00e9 them and add them to this torta for an extra-filling dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/09/dining/JR-torta-ahogada/merlin_193269279_696e842e-2642-4c47-b887-be361364c1d4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "bread, pinto beans, salsa, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 366}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 guajillo chiles, stemmed, seeded and rinsed", "6 chiles de \u00e1rbol, stemmed, seeded and rinsed", "1 small white onion, halved", "3 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 pound beefsteak tomatoes, halved", "Kosher salt", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar", "1 medium red onion, sliced into 1/4-inch rings", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt\u00a0", "3 cups cooked strained pinto beans, from 2 (15-ounce) cans or homemade", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "Kosher salt\u00a0", "4 birote salado, bolillos or 6-inch pieces French baguette, split in half horizontally", "8 cilantro sprigs, for serving", "1 lemon, cut into wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the salsa: Combine the chiles, onion, garlic and tomatoes with 1 cup water and a generous pinch of salt in a medium saucepan.
