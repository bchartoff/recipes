{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Pan-Roasted Scallops With Fresh Tomatoes", "description": "In this homage to a classic dish at Grand Central Oyster Bar in New York, scallops are quickly poached in a creamy, piquant tomato sauce that\u2019s spiked with Worcestershire and celery seed. If you want to work a little ahead, you can make the sauce through Step 2, and leave it in the pan, covered for an hour or two. Reheat it before adding the scallops in Step 3. Then serve the scallops right away, with some bread or rice to soak up every last drop of the herby, savory sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/25/dining/23scallopsrex1/merlin_193269147_61a705c2-0b9c-4131-bd59-92cf86cb7dbb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, main course", "keywords": "clam juice, dry white wine, heavy cream, sea scallop, tomato, vermouth, worcestershire sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2030}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup thinly sliced shallots or red onion", "Pinch of celery seeds", "Salt\u00a0and black pepper", "2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes", "2/3 cup dry white vermouth, dry white wine or clam juice", "4 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 cup heavy cream", "2 pounds sea scallops, patted dry", "1/2 cup chopped fresh chives, plus more for garnish", "1/2 cup chopped celery leaves or parsley leaves, or a combination, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high and add the butter, letting it melt.
