It starts with a basic dumpling batter. Just stir together the ingredients, then cook them in liquid on the stovetop until they become fluffy all the way through. Poaching the dumplings in a combination of apple cider, brown sugar and cinnamon means they take on a jammy exterior and absorb some of sweetness in the process. As the dumplings cook, they release some starch into the liquid, which thickens the poaching liquid into a sauce. It\u2019s topped with a lightly whipped vanilla cream, which has a consistency similar to melted ice cream and coats each and every bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/19/dining/ejm-caramel-apple-dumplings/merlin_179656146_8459c180-5b2b-4712-992e-c6ae7e62e37c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings (about 5 to 6 dumplings per person)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dumplings, dessert", "keywords": "apple, apple cider, brown sugar, heavy cream, fall, winter, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 68}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons heavy cream", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup/220 grams packed light or dark brown sugar", "4 cups/960 milliliters apple cider", "2 cinnamon sticks", "Pinch of kosher salt", "2 3/4 cups/350 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/110 grams light or dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/165 grams Honeycrisp or Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and diced (from about 2 medium apples)", "1 cup/240 milliliters cold heavy cream", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the apple cider-caramel sauce: In a medium pot, heat the cream and butter over medium until the butter is melted.
