{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brandied Dried Fruit", "description": "The complex layers of flavor that develop from combining dried fruit, citrus, spices and brandy are the reward for an investment of time. And time does most of the work in this recipe, which produces brandied fruit that you can use in\u00a0an array of dishes and drinks: A two-day soak will get you a fine infusion, but go for the full 14 to extract notes from each component. The spices need time to bloom, and the dried fruit skins plump as they are infused, absorbing the citrus\u2019s bite and the brandy\u2019s warmth. Use the fruit mixture in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021678-brandied-fruit-scones\">scones</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021677-saratoga-holiday-cocktail\">cocktails</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021679-braised-lamb-with-squash-and-brandied-fruit\">braised lamb</a>. Or stir the drained fruit into muffin or cake batter, toss with bulkier fruit like apples or pears for use as a filling for hand pies, or serve as a relish to accompany lamb, pork or chicken. As an added bonus, the fruit mixture keeps in the refrigerator for months. Store in an airtight container and avoid adding any moisture to the jar by using only dry utensils to serve.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/24/dining/yk-dried-fruit/merlin_180213339_ab576880-0aad-4c06-9ca0-ebac4afde666-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P14DT15M", "recipeYield": "About 5 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, project", "keywords": "christmas, new year\u2019s day, currants, dried apricots, dried cherries, dried cranberries, dried pears, lemon, orange, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 603}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces/225 grams currants or raisins", "8 ounces/225 grams dried cranberries", "4 ounces/110 grams dried cherries", "2 ounces/55 grams dried pears, finely chopped", "2 ounces/55 grams dried apricots, thinly sliced", "1 orange", "1 lemon, sliced thin and seeds removed, chopped", "2 tablespoons fresh grated ginger (from about a 2-inch piece)", "1 teaspoon anise seeds", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "About 1 cup/250 milliliters brandy"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the currants, cranberries, cherries, pears and apricots.
