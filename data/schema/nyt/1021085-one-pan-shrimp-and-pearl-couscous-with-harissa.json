{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pan Shrimp and Pearl Couscous With Harissa", "description": "This easy dish relies on harissa for its flavorful broth. Different brands can vary wildly in flavor and heat, so incorporate the harissa slowly, especially if yours is very spicy, and add more at the end to taste. The final dish does have some sauciness to it: The starch from the couscous will thicken the sauce in the few minutes it takes to go from stovetop to table, but you may want to provide a spoon along with a fork. If you prefer a drier dish, you can reduce the amount of water by 1/4 cup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/15/dining/ssp-shrimp-couscous/merlin_171962982_012b262e-704b-4dd5-910d-6b5bd3f51a21-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, one pot, seafood, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "couscous, harissa, onion, shrimp, tomato, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 892}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 to 4 tablespoons harissa paste, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 medium yellow onion, finely diced", "1 cup pearl couscous or orzo", "3 to 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes, halved crosswise", "1/2 cup fresh Italian parsley leaves, packed, coarsely chopped or left whole"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, toss shrimp with 1/4 teaspoon salt, a few grinds of black pepper and 1 tablespoon harissa.
