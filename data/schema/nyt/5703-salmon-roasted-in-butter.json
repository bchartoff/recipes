{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon Roasted in Butter", "description": "This simple fish dish is best made with wild salmon, but it works equally well with the farmed sort. It's astonishingly easy. In a hot oven, melt butter in a skillet until it sizzles, add the salmon, flip, remove the skin, then allow to roast a few minutes more. You'll have an elegant fish dinner in about 15 minutes. Don't be afraid to play with herb and fat combinations: parsley, chervil or dill work well with butter; thyme, basil or marjoram with olive oil; or peanut oil with cilantro or mint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/14/dining/14ROASTEDSALMON/14ROASTEDSALMON-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "butter, fish, salmon fillet, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3855}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 345, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "339 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter", "4 tablespoons minced chervil, parsley or dill", "1 salmon fillet, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.
