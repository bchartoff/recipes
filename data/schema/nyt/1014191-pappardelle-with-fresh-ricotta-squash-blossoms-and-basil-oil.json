{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pappardelle With Fresh Ricotta, Squash Blossoms and Basil Oil", "description": "Ricotta is one of the great undersung cheeses and can be used in dozens of ways. Bake it in a hot oven in an earthenware dish with a little olive oil and rosemary, then spread it on toast for an antipasto or snack. Mix it with chopped cooked spinach or chard for filling ravioli or layering into baked pasta. Or, as is done here, fold the cheese into pappardelle noodles with barely cooked zucchini and squash blossoms and serve with basil oil and grated pecorino for a sensational summer pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/pappardelle-ricotta-squash-basil/pappardelle-ricotta-squash-basil-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "main course, pappardelle, ricotta, squash blossoms, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 61}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 503, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "406 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 12 basil leaves, roughly chopped", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "Salt", "pepper", "1 pound pappardelle or other pasta", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 pound small zucchini, thinly sliced", "Salt", "pepper", "About 12 squash blossoms, stems removed", "1/2 pound fresh ricotta about 1 cup, at room temperature", "Pecorino cheese, for grating"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the basil oil, in a small dish stir together the basil, garlic, lemon zest and olive oil.
