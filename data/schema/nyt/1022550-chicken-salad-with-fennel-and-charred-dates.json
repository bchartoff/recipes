{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Salad With Fennel and Charred Dates", "description": "The unlikely inspiration for this savory-sweet salad comes from Lilia, an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn, where vanilla gelato is adorned with sea salt, honey, olive oil and fennel pollen for a dessert that is citrusy, creamy and fresh. The savory spin goes like this: Thinly slice two fennel bulbs, then mix with shallots and shredded cooked chicken. Dates cook in olive oil so their outsides blister and their insides become caramel-like and soft. Fennel seeds and red-pepper flakes are added to the skillet, which creates a spiced oil for dressing the salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/dining/as-chicken-salad-with-fennel-and-charred-dates/merlin_193269126_41d9bb9c-9d45-43a9-9219-d2fdd9dcdb2a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, quick, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "chicken, chicken salad, dates, fennel, shallot", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 232}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 small fennel bulbs (about 2 pounds total), tough outer layers removed, fronds reserved, stalks thinly sliced, bulbs halved and thinly sliced through the root", "1 shallot, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 2 lemons), plus more to taste", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 cups shredded cooked chicken (about 1 pound)", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "8 Medjool dates, pitted and quartered", "2 teaspoons fennel or coriander seeds", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, toss together the sliced fennel, shallot and lemon juice.
