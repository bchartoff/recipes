{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Tortilla Soup", "description": "Tortilla soup, or sopa Azteca or sopa de tortilla, is a classic central Mexican dish. It\u2019s often characterized by a brothy chicken base flavored with pur\u00e9ed roasted tomatoes, chiles and garlic, and is topped with fried tortillas. In this weeknight-friendly version, tomatoes, onion, garlic and chile are charred under the broiler, on a foil-lined sheet pan for easy cleanup. You can customize the recipe by adding sliced zucchini or epazote leaf with the chopped tomatoes, or stirring in fresh or frozen corn kernels at the end. For a vegetarian version, use cooked black beans instead of chicken.
