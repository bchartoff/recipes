{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dodo (Fried Plantains)", "description": "Fried, grilled, boiled, dehydrated and pulverized, sweet or savory, plantains are a staple of Nigerian cuisine. Dodo, as it is called in Yoruba, refers to fried sweet plantains. For the plantains to caramelize properly, use ripe plantains (the skin should be deep yellow and speckled with large black dots). If you can find only green plantains, you can seal them in a paper bag and let them ripen for 2 to 3 days. Cooking the plantains in hot oil brings out their caramelized sweetness, and a quick toss with pickled onions adds an acidic bite.
