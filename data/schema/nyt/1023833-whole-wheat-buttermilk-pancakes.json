These aren\u2019t. Letting the batter rest for five minutes while the pan heats ensures that the pancakes will be tender and delicate. The flour will hydrate and soften, doing away with any heaviness but keeping its deep, delicious flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/17/multimedia/as-whole-wheat-buttermilk-pancakes-bmpl/as-whole-wheat-buttermilk-pancakes-bmpl-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings (about 10 pancakes)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, for two, quick, pancakes, main course", "keywords": "buttermilk, whole-wheat flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 168}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large eggs", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups/480 milliliters buttermilk (see Tip)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for cooking and serving", "2 1/2 cups/270 grams whole-wheat flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "Maple syrup, jam, and/or nut butter, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, salt and vanilla to combine, then whisk in the buttermilk and butter.
