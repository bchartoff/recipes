{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Pickles With Pickled Ranch Dip", "description": "Fried pickles come in many shapes and sizes, but this recipe approaches them in a way that maximizes their crunch: First, it calls for pickle chips, which yield a better coating-to-filling ratio than pickle spears. Next, the pickles are patted dry to remove extra moisture, ensuring that the breading adheres to every nook and cranny. Finally, breading the pickles in a flour-buttermilk-bread-crumb sequence creates a robust crust. When frying breaded ingredients, be mindful of residual cooking: Remove your cooked items from the hot oil just before they reach their desired shade of golden brown, as they\u2019ll continue to cook \u2014 and darken \u2014 after being removed from the heat. Frying the pickles mutes their acidity, but adding chopped pickles to the dill-flecked creamy dip bumps up the brightness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/28/dining/aw-fried-pickles-with-pickled-ranch-sauce/merlin_159056730_4f5252fb-242f-478b-a2cd-a5a2488fcbc5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, bread crumbs, buttermilk, chives, dill, flour, mayonnaise, pickles", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 106}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups drained bread and butter pickle chips (about 8 ounces/48 chips)", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill", "3 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives", "1/2 teaspoon garlic salt (optional)", "1/4 teaspoon onion powder", "1 cup buttermilk", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 cups canola or vegetable oil, for frying", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons hot sauce, such as Crystal", "1 1/4 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a large baking sheet with paper towels.
