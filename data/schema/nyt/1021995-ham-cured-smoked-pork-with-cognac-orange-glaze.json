{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ham-Cured, Smoked Pork With Cognac-Orange Glaze", "description": "Think of this cured, smoked pork loin as ham you can make in a hurry, with 2 days\u2019 curing time and an hour or so of smoking, as opposed to the weeks or even months that a traditional ham takes. Plus, the loin has no bones, so it\u2019s a snap to carve. For the best results, use a heritage pork loin, like Berkshire or Duroc. Depending on your grill, the pork and the weather, smoking time may be as short as 1 hour or as long as 1 1/2 hours. The orange juice in this Cognac-citrus glaze cuts the saltiness of the cure, while the Cognac makes a nice counterpoint to the wood smoke. Besides, brown sugar and orange marmalade go great with salty ham.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/18Hamrex2/merlin_185056815_297077a6-000d-4de5-9447-999c1b460341-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P2DT4H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, meat, project, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "brown sugar, cognac, orange, pork loin, salt, easter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 packed cup dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup kosher salt", "2 teaspoons Prague powder #1", "2 fresh or dried bay leaves", "2 fresh orange zest strips", "2 cloves", "1 (3-pound) boneless pork loin", "2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice", "1/2 cup Cognac", "1/2 packed cup dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup orange marmalade", "1 cinnamon stick", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "1 tablespoon Cointreau, Grand Marnier or other orange liqueur", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch chunks", "Sea salt and black\u00a0pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the brine: Bring 1 quart of water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat.
