{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ande ki Kari (Eggs in Spicy Tomato Sauce)", "description": "In this classic Indian dish, adapted from the cookbook author Julie Sahni, hard-cooked eggs are swathed in a spicy tomato gravy fragrant with cardamom, cumin and cinnamon. Since garam masala spice blends vary in their chile content, sample yours before adding it to the sauce, then stir it in to taste. You can make the sauce and hard-cook the eggs a day ahead (store them in the refrigerator), but the eggs are best introduced to the pot just before serving; simply reheat them in the simmering sauce. You can serve the eggs over rice, or with flatbread on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/29/dining/29APPE1/29APPE1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, curries", "keywords": "coconut oil, coriander, eggs, garam masala, garlic, ghee, ginger, tomato, gluten-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 257}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 260, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "545 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 large eggs, at room temperature", "3 to 4 medium-size ripe tomatoes, halved through their equators", "3 tablespoons ghee, butter, safflower oil or grapeseed oil", "3 tablespoons virgin coconut oil", "2 cups finely chopped onions", "6 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick", "8 cardamom pods, lightly crushed with the flat side of a knife", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 cup boiling water", "1 to 2 teaspoons garam masala, to taste", "3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro", "Plain yogurt, for serving (optional)", "Cooked basmati rice or flatbread, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Hard-boil the eggs: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then carefully lower eggs into water.
