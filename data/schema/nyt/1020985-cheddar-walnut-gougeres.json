{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheddar-Walnut Goug\u00e8res", "description": "Goug\u00e8res, small cheese puffs made from the same neither-sweet-nor-savory dough you\u2019d use for cream puffs or \u00e9clairs, are my favorite pre-dinner nibble with wine. They\u2019re slightly crusty on the outside, custardy on the inside and, because I add mustard and chopped nuts, surprising. The traditional cheese for these is French Comt\u00e9 or Swiss Gruy\u00e8re, but lately I\u2019ve been using shredded sharp American Cheddar, which makes them a tad more tender and gives them a little edge, nice in a morsel that\u2019s meant to whet your appetite. I like these a few minutes out of the oven, but room temperature puffs have legions of fans as well. It\u2019s good to know that raw puffs freeze perfectly (pack them into an airtight container as soon as they\u2019re solidly frozen) and bake perfectly from the freezer. Arrange them on a lined baking sheet and leave them on the counter while you preheat the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/magazine/12mag-eat/12mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 55 goug\u00e8res", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, pastries, appetizer", "keywords": "butter, cheddar, eggs, flour, milk, walnut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 249}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 4 chunks", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk (or water)", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "4 large eggs, at room temperature, plus 1 large egg white, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 1/2 cups/150 grams loosely packed shredded sharp Cheddar (or a mix of Comt\u00e9, Gruy\u00e8re, Swiss, Jack or other semifirm cheeses)", "2/3 cup/80 grams lightly toasted finely chopped walnuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400 degrees.
