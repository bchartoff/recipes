{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaghetti With Sausage Alla Carbonara", "description": "A few days after a tasting of 2005 Barbarescos, I had dinner at Centolire, Pino Luongo\u2019s Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side. As I cruised the wine list, Mr. Luongo suggested a Barbaresco he had just acquired. Perfect timing.The menu offered several dishes that would seem to complement a Barbaresco, including chicken livers on a bed of fennel, a Tuscan pot roast, and spaghetti with sausage. My husband and I tried them all. The intensity of the chicken livers and beef, however, seemed to point more toward Barolo. The pasta, Mr. Luongo\u2019s variation on the classic carbonara, delivered balance and richness.His approach to cooking is a very grandmotherly \u201csome of this, some of that.\u201d He did provide some measurements, but I felt at ease adjusting them to my taste, like reducing the amount of pepper and increasing the cheese.
