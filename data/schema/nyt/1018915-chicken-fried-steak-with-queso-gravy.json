Instead of serving the fried steaks with a peppery cream gravy, I\u2019ve followed the teachings of Lisa Fain, who writes the \"Homesick Texan\" blog and is the author of \"Queso! Regional Recipes for the World's Favorite Chile-Cheese Dip,\" and applied a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018916-queso-gravy\">queso gravy</a> instead \u2013 the cheese cut with milk, infused with onion, jalape\u00f1o and cumin, and stabilized with a little cornstarch. It\u2019s rich eating, to be sure, but as a result I\u2019ve cut the portion size of the meat down to a mere quarter-pound per person. I like some pico de gallo on top, so there are some raw vegetables above the cheese, and mashed potatoes on the side because that\u2019s how chicken-fried steak is served in Texas, whatever\u2019s on top of the meat.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/03/magazine/03eat1/03eat1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 8", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "egg, milk, top round beef", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 155}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 665, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "524 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds beef top round, cut into 8 equal-size pieces", "Neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed, for frying.", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste", "3 cups all-purpose flour", "3 large eggs", "1/2 cup whole milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the pieces of steak under plastic wrap or parchment paper, and use a meat hammer or the back of a small pan to pound each to a uniform 1/4-inch thickness, roughly doubling its surface size.
