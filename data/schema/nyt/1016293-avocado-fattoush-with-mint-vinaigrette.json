{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Avocado Fattoush With Mint Vinaigrette", "description": "The crunchy, juicy salad known in the Middle East as fattoush is just one of the region\u2019s many thrifty and tasty uses for day-old or dried-out bread. Stale bread is better than fresh for some dishes because it will absorb more liquid, such as the juices from a ripe tomato or \u2014 in this recipe \u2014 a lively dressing with mint leaves, lemon juice and a bit of honey to smooth out the flavors.  The Israeli-American chef Einat Admony, who created this rewrite of the classic, took the radical step of leaving out the tomato and adding avocado, a very American ingredient. \n<br/><br/>\nTo make the bread shards very crisp, toast and let cool before breaking.  To make them more luxurious, tear up the bread and toast it in a hot skillet with a few tablespoons of olive oil, butter, or both.
