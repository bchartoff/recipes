{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cumin Steak With Kale, Fennel and Feta Salad", "description": "Want a juicy steak dinner on the fly? Skirt steak is fast, flavorful and forgiving. With a searing-hot grill and a quick marinade (30 minutes does the trick), you can yield a deeply charred, flavor-packed crust with a tender inside. Make sure not to overcook this; medium to medium-rare is ideal. The equally fast side of shaved kale, fennel and crumbled feta is a willing accompaniment to any steak dinner, and just as at home with a pork tenderloin or chops. Raisins, a subtle addition, add a bit of natural sweetness, but skip them if you\u2019re raisin-averse.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/dining/sc-cumin-steak/sc-cumin-steak-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, steaks and chops", "keywords": "fennel, feta, kale, skirt steak, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 85}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 582, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "725 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds skirt steak", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon black pepper", "4 tablespoons lemon juice (from 2 lemons)", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 garlic clove, chopped or pressed", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 small bunch lacinato kale, stemmed, ribbed and thinly sliced (about 10 cups or 10 ounces)", "1 small head fennel (or 1/2 a large head), thinly sliced (about 8 ounces)", "6 ounces feta cheese, crumbled", "1/3 cup raisins (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat steak dry with paper towels and place in a resealable bag or large bowl with 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic and cumin.
