{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Mac and Cheese", "description": "Many creamy vegan pasta recipes call for an arsenal of expensive ingredients, but this one relies on more approachable ones, like cashews and almond milk for richness, nutritional yeast for tang and soy sauce for complex saltiness. Saut\u00e9ed onions do double duty: They serve as a thickener and help offset the sweetness of the cashews. This simple stovetop pasta is wonderful on its own, but feel free to add roasted vegetables, fresh herbs, spices, harissa or hot sauce. For a quick-baked version worthy of Thanksgiving dinner, pile the prepared mac and cheese into a casserole dish, top with panko and more nutritional yeast, and broil for a few minutes until golden brown.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/12/dining/aw-vegan-macaroni-and-cheese/aw-vegan-macaroni-and-cheese-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "almond milk, cashew, garlic, macaroni, mustard powder, nutritional yeast, onion, onion powder, pasta, soy sauce, turmeric, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 551}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "4 ounces raw, unsalted cashews", "3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk (or other unsweetened nut milk)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 large yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "3/4 teaspoon onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon mustard powder", "Black pepper", "1/2 cup nutritional yeast, plus more to taste", "5 teaspoons tamari or low-sodium soy sauce", "16 ounces elbow macaroni or medium shells", "1 cup panko bread crumbs", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing", "2 tablespoons nutritional yeast", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, add the cashews to a large nonstick skillet and heat over medium, stirring frequently, until fragrant, toasty and slightly golden, about 4 minutes.
