{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bademjan Kebab", "description": "Bademjan kebab is traditionally pan-fried eggplant stuffed with bieh, a herb-and-nut sauce that, in Northern Iran, uses sour fruit molasses along with the typical sweet and sour pomegranate molasses. An important Northern Iranian spice, Persian hogweed is earthy, sour and slightly bitter, with a pungent scent; you can find it at Middle Eastern groceries. Mr. Sadr saut\u00e9s the bieh until the herbs and nuts cook down into a dark green, thick paste, which is spooned onto partially roasted eggplant halves then roasted. Northern Iranian cooking doesn\u2019t use a lot of spices, so the herbs, nuts and molasses create a deeply flavored, almost meaty vegan sauce. It\u2019s flexible, so sub in dill, basil, tarragon, savory or scallion for any of the herbs. The bieh will keep for 1 week in the fridge and up to 3 months in the freezer, so you can make it in advance. If eating this dish as a main, Mr. Sadr suggests serving it with plain or turmeric basmati rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Leena Trivedi-Grenier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/16/dining/10sadrerex2/merlin_175613238_52b00e20-debc-495f-9735-5375abdec011-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 entr\u00e9e servings or 12 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cilantro, eggplant, hazelnut, molasses, sumac, turmeric, walnut, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 27}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups raw walnuts (about 8 ounces)", "Heaping 1/3 cup raw, skinned hazelnuts (about 2 ounces)", "2 cups roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems (from about 2 bunches)", "1 cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems (from about 1 bunch)", "Scant 1/2 cup roughly chopped chives (from about 1/2 bunch)", "1/3 cup roughly chopped mint leaves (from about 1/2 bunch)", "1/4 cup stemmed, roughly chopped sorrel (from about 1/2 bunch), or 1 cup roughly chopped foraged wood sorrel leaves", "1/2 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped", "3 large garlic cloves, peeled", "1/2 cup neutral oil", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground Persian hogweed (optional)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup Sour Plum Molasses (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021283-hanif-sadrs-sour-plum-molasses\">see recipe</a>)", "1/4 cup pomegranate molasses", "6 medium Italian eggplants (about 1 pound each)", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons sumac", "Chopped herbs, barberries, sprouts and pomegranate seeds, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the bieh: In a food processor, pulse the walnuts and hazelnuts until very finely ground, then set nuts aside in a small bowl.
