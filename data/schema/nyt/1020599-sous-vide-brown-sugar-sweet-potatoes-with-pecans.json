Cooking the sweet potatoes with a sous-vide machine is convenient when your oven is otherwise occupied, but you can also bake them. Just wrap them, peeled but whole, in foil; place on a baking pan and bake at 375 degrees for an hour or two depending upon how large the potatoes are, until very tender.
