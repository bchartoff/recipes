{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rosemary and Pistachio Granola", "description": "This recipe came to The Times from the chef Steve Redzikowski of OAK fourteenth in Boulder, Colo., and moves granola out of the breakfast realm while still remembering its hippie roots. It is a savory mix, pairing rosemary and red-pepper flakes with a flourish of juniper berries. As with most granolas, simply mix the ingredients and toast them in a low oven until crisp. The result here makes for a substantial afternoon snack, but try it using it as a crust for red meat. It\u2019s a surprising addition to dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/20/dining/20GRANOLA_SPAN/20GRANOLA_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "5 cups (4 to 6 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, quick", "keywords": "main course, pistachio, rolled oats, rosemary, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 19}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 520, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "4 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats", "2 cups shelled pistachios", "1/2 cup honey", "3 tablespoons butter", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves", "1 tablespoon chile flakes", "1 tablespoon finely ground juniper berries."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
