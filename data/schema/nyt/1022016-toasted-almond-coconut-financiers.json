{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Toasted Almond-Coconut Financiers", "description": "These simple, French-style cookie-cakes are usually baked in special rectangular molds to resemble little bars of gold. In her book \u201cParis Sweets\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2012), Dorie Greenspan makes the process easier by baking them in mini-muffin tins, and the method works beautifully. They bake up soft and chewy, into perfect two-bite-size treats. This recipe uses toasted almond flour, which deepens the flavor. A dip in melted bittersweet chocolate gives the financiers a polished look and balances out their sweetness. This recipe makes 12, but easily doubles for a crowd.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/29/dining/sse-almond-financiers/merlin_185501664_471cbf29-089a-4799-b4d5-98192ef529df-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "12 financiers", "recipeCuisine": "american, french", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, cookies and bars, finger foods, dessert", "keywords": "almond, almond extract, almond flour, butter, chocolate, shredded coconut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 305}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled, plus more for greasing the tin", "1/2 cup/45 grams sweetened, shredded coconut", "1/2 cup/55 grams almond flour", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "Pinch of kosher salt", "2 large egg whites", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "3 ounces/85 grams bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon neutral oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
