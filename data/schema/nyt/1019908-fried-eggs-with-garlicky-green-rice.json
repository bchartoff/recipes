{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Eggs With Garlicky Green Rice", "description": "Fried eggs are a simple vegetarian staple. But set them on top of garlicky kale- and herb-flecked rice, and they form a deeply satisfying supper. This recipe is endlessly customizable: Go with what you have \u2014 reheated leftover rice works equally well as a fresh pot \u2014 or use any whole grain you have. The secret here is locking flavor into the grains by stirring in garlic herbs while the rice is warm. To finish, be generous with the lime \u2014 the acid brings all the flavors up a notch \u2014 and play around with your tolerance for garlic and heat. Lastly, don't be afraid to raid your fridge: Avocado or leftover beans would be right at home here, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/14/dining/sc-fried-eggs/sc-fried-eggs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight", "keywords": "cilantro, eggs, hot sauce, kale, parsley, rice, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 499}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 601, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "83 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "596 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups brown or white basmati or long-grain rice, rinsed and drained", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "4 large eggs", "Black pepper", "1/2 small bunch kale, stems removed and leaves finely chopped (about 1 packed cup)", "1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, stems discarded and leaves finely chopped (about 1 packed cup)", "1/2 bunch fresh parsley, stems discarded and leaves finely chopped (about 1 packed cup)", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and finely chopped", "4 small pink radishes or 1 large watermelon radish, thinly sliced", "4 ounces cotija cheese or queso fresco", "2 limes, cut in wedges", "Hot sauce, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook rice with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt according to package instructions.
