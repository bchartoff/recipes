{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cinnamon-Date Sticky Buns", "description": "These sticky buns are positively habit-forming, with a winning flavor combination that\u2019s a spin on the traditional cinnamon roll. Here, dates take the place of granulated sugar, pairing deliciously with orange zest and adding a sweetness that counters the salted caramel sauce drizzled on top. The lemon adds a slight tang against buttery brioche rolls. The dough comes together easily in a stand mixer, but can be done by hand if you\u2019re willing to tackle some kneading (see Tip below). If this is your first time working with a rising dough, make sure to give yourself enough time (about 2 hours) for it to double in size.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Klancy Miller"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/dining/KM-cinnamon-date-sticky-buns/merlin_149236953_3dd2be90-c61d-4e86-8ab9-641b9f863f98-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "14 buns", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, pastries", "keywords": "butter, cinnamon, medjool dates, sugar, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 59}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 463, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "198 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 to 6 cups/640 to 770 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out dough", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters warm water", "1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "4 eggs, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons plus 3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast", "2 tablespoons half-and-half", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into small pieces, at room temperature, plus more for greasing pans", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "8 ounces Medjool dates, pitted (about 1 cup chopped)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon fresh orange zest", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup light corn syrup", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), cut into small pieces, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream", "1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: Combine 1 cup flour with the water, sugar, eggs, yeast and half-and-half in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.
