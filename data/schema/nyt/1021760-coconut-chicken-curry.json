This dish from \u201cBurma Superstar\u201d by Desmond Tan and Kate Leahy (Ten Speed Press, 2017), needs time on the stove but not much attention, and gets even better after resting in the fridge, making it an ideal weeknight meal that can last days. There\u2019s plenty of coconut milk broth to spoon over rice or noodles. At his restaurant, Burma Superstar in Oakland, Calif., Mr. Tan also serves this with platha, a buttery, flaky Burmese flatbread, for dipping.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/06/dining/04Cookbooksrex2-curry/merlin_181749069_bac75581-7b0e-4426-8d8b-1803663440fd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, curries, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, coconut milk, curry powder, fish sauce, madras curry powder, paprika", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 4502}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1 tablespoon ground paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup canola oil", "2 yellow onions, finely diced", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 (13-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk", "1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon Madras curry powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "Cooked rice or noodles, for serving", "1 cup cilantro sprigs, for serving", "1 lime or lemon, cut into wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the chicken thighs of excess fat and cut into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces; transfer to a bowl.
