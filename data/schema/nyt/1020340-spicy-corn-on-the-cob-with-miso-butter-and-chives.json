But for lovers of spice, the Japanese spice blend shichimi togarashi is worth seeking out. In English, it translates to \u201cseven-flavor chile pepper,\u201d though not all of those seven flavors are chile: There\u2019s also roasted orange peel, sesame seeds, ground ginger and seaweed in the mix. Add it gradually, so as not to overpower the subtle flavor of the miso butter (and because everyone likes a different amount of spice). If you can\u2019t find shichimi togarashi, substitute crushed red-pepper flakes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Fleischaker"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/14/dining/ef-corn-on-the-cob-with-miso-butter-and-chives/merlin_157388811_fc81b580-7de2-4b21-baf7-12edd388bab8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, butter, chives, corn, miso, red pepper flakes, shichimi togarashi, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 44}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ears fresh corn, shucked", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons white miso paste", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives", "1 teaspoon shichimi togarashi or crushed red-pepper flakes", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat your grill to medium-high.
