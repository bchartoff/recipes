{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Niku Jyaga (Japanese Beef and Potato Stew)", "description": "There\u2019s nothing extraordinary about meat and potatoes stewed in a sweet soy broth, and yet it\u2019s easy to find yourself taking just one more taste until half the pot is gone. Patience pays off though: niku jyaga tastes better the second day, when the potatoes are saturated with sauce. Every household makes it a little differently in Japan, and so the flavor is affectionately called \u201cmother\u2019s taste.\u201d Saori Kurioka, a private chef in Brooklyn, cooks hers the same minimalist way her mother and grandmother did in Kobe, with just beef, potatoes, onion and carrot. She uses a wooden otoshibuta, a drop-lid that fits inside the pot, so the vegetables simmer and steam evenly as the broth slowly concentrates, but the same thing can be achieved with parchment paper. Beveling the edges of the potatoes with a peeler keeps them from crumbling as the jostle around the simmering pot, but skip it if you\u2019re rushed or impatient.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hannah Kirshner"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/25/dining/HK-beef-stew-horizontal/merlin_141075267_0c440d4f-8d3e-41a1-a1de-fb7accc83f7b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef, potato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 120}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 281, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "642 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 medium waxy potatoes, such as Yukon Gold (about 2 1/2 pounds)", "2 medium carrots, peeled", "2 small onions (about 1 pound), peeled", "1 piece dried kombu, about 8 inches by 5 inches, broken in half (optional)", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "3 tablespoons mirin", "3 tablespoons sake", "3 tablespoons raw or turbinado sugar", "8 ounces thinly sliced, well-marbled beef (see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel potatoes and cut each into 4 to 6 pieces, so they are relatively uniform in size.
