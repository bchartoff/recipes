{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Herb Kuku", "description": "Kuku is a traditional Persian egg dish similar to a frittata. This version by the Iranian food writer Najmieh Batmanglij was served at the White House at Michelle Obama's Nowruz celebration on April 6. In it, a variety of fresh green herbs are mixed with fragrant spices, chopped walnuts and just enough eggs to bind everything together. Dried barberries, caramelized with grape molasses or sugar, make a pretty and sweet-tart garnish. If you can\u2019t get barberries, substitute dried cranberries. Kuku can be served warm or at room temperature, and can be made a day in advance. Leftovers make excellent sandwiches when stuffed into lavash or pita with yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/20/dining/20JPAPPE6/20JPAPPE6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "barberries, eggs, romaine, rose petal, spring onions, walnut, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 320}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 359, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "346 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped", "6 eggs", "1 1/2 teaspoons coarse sea salt", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground rose petal (optional)", "1 cup finely chopped parsley", "1 cup finely chopped cilantro", "1 cup finely chopped fresh dill", "1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves (optional)", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts", "1/2 cup finely chopped romaine lettuce", "1/2 cup finely chopped spring onions, white and green parts", "2 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced", "1 tablespoon rice flour", "1/3 cup dried barberries or cranberries, soaked in cold water for 15 minutes, rinsed and drained", "1 teaspoon grape molasses, or substitute sugar", "Lavash, for serving (optional)", "Yogurt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
