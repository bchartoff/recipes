{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Zucchini With Crispy Parmesan and Black Pepper", "description": "This summery side dish is inspired by the flavors of cacio e pepe, Rome\u2019s beloved pasta dish. Zucchini or summer squash is seared in a very hot pan until golden, and while it cooks, coarsely ground black pepper is separately toasted and butter is added to brown. (Be sure to salt your zucchini just before you add it to the hot pan \u2014 not sooner \u2014 as they can release water and become mushy if salted and left to sit.) If you can, take the time to grate your own Parmesan for a lighter, almost pillowy-like consistency that melts into the butter and forms chewy-like nuggets of cheese. (This will not be a smooth, emulsified sauce.) Like many good summer dishes, this one is finished with torn basil. Serve with a side of grilled sausages or pearled couscous tossed with pesto. A tumbler of ros\u00e9 would make this dinner worthy of eating outside on the back porch, dish in lap.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/16/dining/ch-seared-zucchini/ch-seared-zucchini-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "basil, black pepper, butter, parmesan, zucchini, fall, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1472}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt", "1 1/2 pounds baby zucchini or summer squash (or use regular zucchini on the smaller side), ends trimmed and halved lengthwise\u00a0", "2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces", "2 ounces freshly grated Parmesan or Grana Padano cheese", "1/4 cup torn basil or mint leaves, or a combination", "Flaky sea salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high for 2 minutes.
