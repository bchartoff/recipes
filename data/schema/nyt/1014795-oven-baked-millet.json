{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oven-Baked Millet", "description": "Deborah Madison, in her wonderful new cookbook, \u201cVegetable Literacy,\u201d put a new spin on millet that may have changed my millet-cooking life forever. She suggests cooking the grain as you would a polenta, which it kind of resembles when it\u2019s cooked, with most of the grains breaking down to a mush while others remain crunchy. I\u2019d always been a bit flummoxed by this uneven cooking and the texture of the broken-down millet (it\u2019s a bit chalky). But serving it like a polenta makes perfect sense. You can serve it soft, right after it\u2019s cooked, or let it set up and then slice it and crisp the slices or use them in gratins, as I do with cornmeal polenta. I was so taken with this idea that I decided to cook the millet in the oven, the way I do for my easy cornmeal polenta, after first toasting it in the pan. It worked beautifully.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/11/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, millet, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 24}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 169, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "466 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups water (or stock)", "1 cup millet", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 tablespoon butter (more to taste)", "1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan", "Freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
