Cookbook.\u201d I use her technique for roasting the carrots, and use the same spices she uses, but I make the dish with a little less olive oil and butter to cut down on calories. Suzanne serves her mix of carrots, turnips, parsnips and rutabagas with Greek yogurt seasoned with kaffir lime juice and zest, and mint chutney. They are also delicious on their own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/14/science/13recipehealth/13recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 957}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 121, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "268 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 medium carrots, peeled", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted", "1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds, lightly toasted", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper or mild chili powder", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
