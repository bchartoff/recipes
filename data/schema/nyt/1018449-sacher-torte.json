{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sacher Torte", "description": "In this version of the classic Viennese Sacher torte, from Luisa Weiss's cookbook \"Classic German Baking,\" two dense chocolate cake layers are filled and topped with rum-scented apricot jam, then coated in a fudgelike chocolate glaze. Making a perfect Sacher torte with a level top and pristine shiny icing takes patience and precision. But don\u2019t let that discourage you from having a go. Even if the glaze is slightly smudged and the top a bit askew, it will still taste delicious, and there are few cakes as richly satisfying as this.\n\nYou can make a Sacher torte up to 3 days before serving. Store it under a cake dome or loosely covered, at room temperature.\n\n(Update: Some readers were having trouble with the glaze seizing in the original recipe. Luisa Weiss retested it, and we made some updates to the recipe that should clear it up.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/07/dining/07JPCOOKBOOKS8/07JPCOOKBOOKS8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "austrian", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "apricot jam, bittersweet chocolate, cake flour, rum, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 784, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "136 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "135 milligrams", "sugarContent": "101 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 1/2 tablespoons/120 grams unsalted butter (1 stick plus 1/2 tablespoon), more for greasing pan", "1/2 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons/80 grams cake flour, more for flouring pan", "1 cup/120 grams bittersweet chocolate (minimum 50 percent cacao)", "6 large eggs, yolks and whites separated", "3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon/100 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/80 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon/40 grams cornstarch", "1 cup/300 grams apricot jam", "2 tablespoons dark rum", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/4 cups/150 grams bittersweet chocolate (minimum 50 percent cacao), chopped", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a baking sheet in the oven and heat it to 350 degrees.
