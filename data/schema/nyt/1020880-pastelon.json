{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pastel\u00f3n", "description": "Pastel\u00f3n is a layered Puerto Rican casserole of plantains, cheese and picadillo, a tomato-based ground beef mixture seasoned with onions, peppers, herbs and spices. The dish is often referred to as Puerto Rican lasagna, and to say there is only one real recipe for pastel\u00f3n would be like saying there\u2019s only one true lasagna. Variations abound! Some cooks boil the plantains and make a mash with taro; others fry them until they\u2019re sweet and crisp. Nearly any mild, meltable cheese may be used, though there is debate over whether or not to add raisins. This recipe is adapted from from Natalia Vallejo, chef and owner of Cocina al Fondo in Santurce, Puerto Rico. She doesn\u2019t serve pastel\u00f3n at her restaurant, but she grew up eating it. Her version includes fried plantains, mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and raisins, because she says \u201cPuerto Ricans like that sweet-and-salty mix.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/18/dining/dg-pastelon/merlin_169064670_d5e76676-b9ec-4caa-a4da-2d8073e95757-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, meat, vegetables", "keywords": "cumin, ground beef, mozzarella, olives, plantain, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 235}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 medium-ripe (yellow with some black spots) large plantains (about 4 1/2 pounds)", "1 cup canola oil", "1 small yellow onion (about 4 ounces), peeled and roughly chopped", "1 small green bell pepper (about 5 1/2 ounces), seeded and roughly chopped", "2 aj\u00ed dulce chiles, seeded and roughly chopped (optional)", "3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "2 fresh cilantro stems with leaves, roughly chopped", "2 fresh culantro (recao) stems with leaves, roughly chopped (optional)", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "3/4 pound fresh tomatoes, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1/2 cup white wine (or water)", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "1/2 cup pimento-stuffed manzanilla olives, quartered", "2 tablespoons yellow or brown raisins (optional)", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 large eggs", "Kosher salt", "2 cups shredded mozzarella (8 to 10 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the plantains: Line a sheet pan with paper towels; set aside.
