{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttermilk Roast Chicken", "description": "Roast a chicken and you know you have a comfortable meal. Alter that a little by butterflying the chicken, a surprisingly simple task that can be carried out with a pair of kitchen scissors, and you have a quick dinner that carries with it the casual air of barbecue, without the bother. Here, buttermilk, which is usually associated with fried chicken, helps to tenderize the chicken and conveys the aromatics: you really get the full value of the rosemary, pepper and garlic. If you want to substitute maple syrup for the honey, you can. Best of all, you can leave the marinating bird in the fridge for up to two days; thus, it gets more tender and you know you have a dinner that needs no more than to be popped into the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/15/dining/15COOKING-BUTTERMILKROASTCHIC2/15COOKING-BUTTERMILKROASTCHIC2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "buttermilk, chicken, rosemary, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1851}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 921, "unsaturatedFatContent": "48 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "69 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "62 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1410 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 4-pound chicken", "2 cups buttermilk", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 cloves garlic, lightly crushed", "1 tablespoon crushed black peppercorns", "1 tablespoon Maldon or other sea salt", "2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves, roughly chopped", "1 tablespoon honey"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butterfly chicken by placing breast side down and using heavy-duty kitchen shears to cut along both sides of backbone.
