{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame Tofu With Coconut-Lime Dressing and Spinach", "description": "Coated in panko and sesame seeds, tofu takes on a splendid crunchiness that contrasts with saut\u00e9ed spinach in this 30-minute dish. It comes together under a fragrant coconut-lime dressing \u2014 which you can double, then toss with salad. Swap out the spinach to your taste: Try this with mustard greens or chopped collard greens, adjusting the cooking time accordingly. Be careful when handling the uncooked tofu once it is breaded, as the breading is delicate. Using a pair of kitchen tongs or two forks to grab the tofu from the sides will help prevent its crumbling or falling apart. Serve this satisfying main by itself, or alongside a bowl of rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/11/dining/ns-crispy-tofu-2/ns-crispy-tofu-2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, beans, main course", "keywords": "coconut milk, egg whites, extra-firm tofu, lime, panko, sesame oil, sesame seeds, spinach, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1495}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk", "1 lime, zested and juiced (1 teaspoon zest and 2 tablespoons juice)", "2 tablespoons sambal oelek", "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup pure sesame oil (or toasted sesame oil, for stronger flavor)", "Fine sea salt", "1 (12-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into 8 equal rectangles", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs (or 1/4 cup cornstarch, for a gluten-free option)", "1/2 cup white sesame seeds (or a mix of black and white)", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Fine sea salt", "2 large egg whites", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed, for pan-frying", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed", "1 shallot, peeled and minced", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "20 ounces spinach", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons minced chives, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dressing: In a medium bowl, whisk together coconut milk, lime zest and juice, sambal oelek and brown sugar until sugar dissolves completely.
