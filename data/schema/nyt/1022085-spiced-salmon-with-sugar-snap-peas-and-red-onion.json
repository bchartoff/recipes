{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Salmon With Sugar Snap Peas and Red Onion", "description": "Seared sugar snap peas and red onions make a sweet accompaniment to silky salmon fillets in this lovely springtime one-pan meal. The salmon fillets, coated in a garlicky spice blend, are briefly browned, leaving fragrant, savory drippings in the pan. Those drippings then season the vegetables, infusing them as they cook. Keep an eye on the salmon, especially if you prefer it on the rare side. Thin fillets in particular are all too easy to overcook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/09/dining/09appetite-salmon/09appetite-salmon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "baharat, red onion, salmon fillet, skillet, sugar snap peas, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1067}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 teaspoon <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021924-baharat-blend\"> baharat spice blend </a>, or use another warm and earthy spice blend, such as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021923-garam-masala\">garam masala</a>", "4 (6- to 8-ounce) salmon fillets", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 medium red onions", "1 pound sugar snap peas (4 cups)", "Lime wedges", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro or mint leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
