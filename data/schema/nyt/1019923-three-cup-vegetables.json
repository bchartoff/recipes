The night before Wen\u2019s death, a guard is said to have made him the surprisingly pungent chicken dish with the prison\u2019s limited resources. It has many variations, but usually calls for braising chicken in rice wine, soy sauce and sesame oil with plenty of ginger, garlic and basil. Here, root vegetables like carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes and turnips take the place of the chicken, but feel free to also add tofu and quick-cooking vegetables like broccoli or snap peas with the roots. Serve over rice or ramen noodles to soak up sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/dining/as-3-cup-roots/as-3-cup-roots-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, lunch, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "basil, ginger, rice wine, root vegetables, sesame oil, soy sauce, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 938}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 321, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "903 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons canola or other neutral oil", "6 cups root vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes and-or turnips, cut into 1/4-inch slices and halved or quartered if large (about 2 pounds)", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced", "10 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "3/4 cup Chinese rice wine", "6 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "2 dried chiles, like chiles de \u00e1rbol, or 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "2 cups fresh basil leaves, torn if large"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers.
