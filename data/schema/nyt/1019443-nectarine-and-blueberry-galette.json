{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nectarine and Blueberry Galette", "description": "The charm of a galette, a casual open-faced tart, is in its imperfections. It's O.K. if the fruit juices leak a little, and there is no fussy crust-crimping for those who find that part of pie-making frustrating. The often-overlooked nectarine is such a perfect summer fruit. It has all the honeyed sweetness of a peach, minus that fuzzy skin, plus a little hit of tartness, and it pairs beautifully with dark, sweet blueberries. The sugar here is given in a range: Use the smaller amount if your fruit is particularly sweet, the larger amount if it\u2019s tart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/24/dining/yossy-nectarine-tart-horizontal/merlin_141364578_e05503ef-d975-4b3a-956d-b6caa5dcca20-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch galette", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "blueberries, nectarine, pie dough, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 426}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 to 8 tablespoons/80 to 100 grams sugar, depending on the sweetness of the fruit", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "Seeds from 1/2 vanilla bean (or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract)", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "Pinch of kosher salt", "2 medium nectarines (about 3/4 pound/340 grams), pitted and sliced into 1/2-inch slices", "1 1/4 cups/180 grams blueberries", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 recipe <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-all-butter-pie-crust\">all-butter pie crust</a>, chilled", "1 egg, beaten", "3/4 teaspoon turbinado sugar", "Pinch of flaky salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees, and position a rack in the lower third of the oven.
