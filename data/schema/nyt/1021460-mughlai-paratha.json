{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mughlai Paratha", "description": "Mughlai paratha is a popular street food found in Bangladesh that traces back to the Mughal Empire. It\u2019s a crisp, flaky, pan-fried flatbread that\u2019s stuffed with fluffy eggs and fiery chiles, and gently spiced with earthy turmeric. Paratha is extremely customizable, so you can use what you have; this version is vegetarian, but <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020913-keema-spiced-ground-meat\">keema</a>, a spiced ground meat mixture, is often added. Vegetables like diced bell pepper or a handful of baby spinach are untraditional and welcome, but be mindful of the water content of the vegetables you choose or the eggs will weep. The end result is satisfyingly savory and addictive in its contrasting textures.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Fahima Haque"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/08/dining/fh-mughlai-paratha/merlin_177593343_8829b4e7-f3c2-478e-927d-e5ab263ae515-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, breads, finger foods, pastries, quick breads, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, cilantro, egg, olive oil, onion, thai chili, turmeric, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 349}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/8 teaspoon baking powder", "3 to 4 teaspoons olive oil, ghee or melted butter", "1/4 cup cold water", "1 whole egg plus 1 yolk", "1/4 red, white or yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1/3 cup)", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "2 to 3 Thai chiles (or 1 Fresno chile or 1 jalape\u00f1o to tone down the heat), finely chopped", "1/4 heaping teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking powder with 2 teaspoons olive oil.
