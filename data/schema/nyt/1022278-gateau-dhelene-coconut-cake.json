Indeed, this cake is best baked, filled, frosted and refrigerated for at least an hour (or up to two days). Kind of like a madeleine, its layers are purposefully a bit dry, as they need to hold a dousing of orange juice and rum. The whipped cream filling and frosting is soft and dreamy. It\u2019s an elegant celebration cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/06/magazine/06mag-eat/06mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 (8-inch) cake (about 8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "apricot preserves, heavy cream, layer cake, make-ahead, orange juice, party, rum, unsweetened coconut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1135}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 1/2 cups/192 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "Finely grated zest of 1 orange (save the juice for the filling)", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters orange juice", "2 tablespoons dark rum (or more orange juice)", "1/2 cup/160 grams apricot preserves", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters cold heavy cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/3 cup/66 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 cups/128 grams unsweetened shredded coconut"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Center a rack in the oven, and heat to 325 degrees.
