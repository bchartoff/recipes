So I added tomatoes to the creamy mixture. I don\u2019t like the color as much, but I love the taste. If you can find green zebra tomatoes, use them for the nice green color. Make sure to strain this because the tomatillo seeds won\u2019t blend.<br/><br/>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/03/science/08recipehealth/08recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, avocado, tomatillo, tomato, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 152, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "493 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound tomatillos, papery shells removed, rinsed", "2 slices red or white onion ", "2 to 3 garlic cloves, to taste", "2 serrano chiles or 1 jalape\u00f1o, coarsely chopped", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (to taste)", "1 large ripe avocado", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro, plus additional cilantro for garnish", "1 teaspoon lightly toasted cumin seeds, ground", "Salt to taste", "Few drops of vinegar", "1 pound ripe tomatoes, preferably green zebras", "Freshly squeezed lime juice for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the tomatillos in a saucepan and cover with water.
