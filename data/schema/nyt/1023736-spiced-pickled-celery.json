Each component, even those used in the smallest measure, works overtime to ensure that this pickle is more than the sum of its parts. With a heady but not overpowering bite, this condiment has tremendous range and can be used to top savory soups and stews, like Mr. Moore\u2019s <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023735-african-peanut-fish-stew\">Peanut Fish Stew</a>, or brighten omelets, sandwiches and salads.
