{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cornbread Madeleines With Jalape\u00f1o", "description": "The inspiration for these madeleines came from a jalape\u00f1o-studded cornbread served at Gloria restaurant in New York. While the restaurant serves them in four-inch disks, that is too large for a holiday gathering. So I made them in madeleine pans (a corn-stick mold would work equally well, though it will make only about 15). In place of the jalape\u00f1os, you could add bits of Cheddar, ham, or minced olives or sun-dried tomatoes. The madeleines freeze beautifully. (Reheat them on a baking sheet covered in foil at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/08/dining/08Pairing1/08Pairing1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick breads", "keywords": "appetizer, corn flour, corn meal, jalape\u00f1o", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 41, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "60 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1/4 cup finely chopped shallots", "3 1/2 ounces jalape\u00f1os, (about 6 medium), stemmed, seeded and minced", "3/4 cup corn meal, preferably stone ground", "1 cup corn flour, preferably stone ground", "2 teaspoons salt", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup whole milk", "3/4 cup buttermilk", "2 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter to grease 3 madeleine pans (12 madeleines each).
