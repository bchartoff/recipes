After a few minutes under the broiler, the cheese bubbles and crisps and the cabbage warms and mellows. The sauerkraut provides plenty of vegetables and, along with the jalape\u00f1o, tames the richness of the cheese. Adapt as you wish: Smear mustard or horseradish on the bread or trade the sauerkraut for kimchi.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/02/dining/as-sauerkraut-toast/merlin_201503079_606dbc98-1a23-417b-a253-b52ef4161bb7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "bread, cheddar, pickled jalape\u00f1o peppers, sauerkraut, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 668}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 slices of bread, such as sourdough, rye, pumpernickel or rustic country bread", "2 cups (8 ounces) drained sauerkraut, coarsely chopped", "16 slices (about 1/3 cup) pickled jalape\u00f1os", "1 cup (4 ounces) grated sharp Cheddar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the oven or toaster oven, heat the broiler to high with a rack 6 or fewer inches from the heat source.
