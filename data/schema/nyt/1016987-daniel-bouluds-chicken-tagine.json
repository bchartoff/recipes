{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Daniel Boulud\u2019s Chicken Tagine", "description": "This recipe for an elegant North African stew comes out of the kitchen of Boulud Sud, Daniel Boulud\u2019s sophisticated Mediterranean French restaurant in New York. It is a dish steeped in the flavors of North Africa, but also of France. Chicken serves as the protein, bathed in a blend of North African spices \u2014 cinnamon and coriander, turmeric, ginger powder and cardamom \u2014 combined with tomatoes, saffron and a little stock. Preserved lemons and olives added at the end provide bite. Tagines are often cooked with root vegetables and dried fruits. Boulud, who famously grew up on a farm, in Lyon, uses cauliflower. \u2018\u2018It is maybe a little more French approach to the tagine,\u2019\u2019 he said. Blanching the cauliflower and tomatoes before cooking them may cause some cooks to blanch themselves. But the effort is worth it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/02/dining/02COOKING_CHICKENTAGINE2/02COOKING_CHICKENTAGINE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french, moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2336}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1036, "unsaturatedFatContent": "52 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "76 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "59 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1695 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 tablespoons sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "2 teaspoons cinnamon", "3 tablespoons ground coriander", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 tablespoon ginger powder", "1/2 tablespoon ground cardamom", "2 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice", "8 chicken thighs, approximately 3 pounds", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons spice mix", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3 Roma tomatoes", "1 head cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets", "1 large white onion, diced", "3 cloves garlic, diced", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "1 pinch saffron", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 cups chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium", "3 tablespoons preserved lemons, approximately 2 lemons, roughly chopped", "1 cup green olives, like Castelvetranos", "1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves picked and stems discarded."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the spices in a dry saut\u00e9 pan set over low heat, and toast them gently until they release their fragrance, 2 minutes or so.
