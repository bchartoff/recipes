{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Corn Griddle Cakes With Spicy Salsa", "description": "Sweet tender corn is one of summer\u2019s great joys, and adding fresh kernels turns these cornmeal griddlecakes into something quite special. Stirring a bit of chopped jalape\u00f1o and chives into the batter improves them all the more. A zippy salsa of chopped summer peppers and tomatoes makes a fine topping. Serve a colorful plateful of them as is, hot off the griddle, or to accompany grilled pork chops. For the best texture and rise, prep the wet and dry ingredients for the batter in advance, but wait to combine them until just before cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/13/dining/13KITCH1/13KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen 3-inch griddle cakes, 6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "bell pepper, cornmeal, jalape\u00f1o, salsa, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 112}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 370, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "620 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups cornmeal", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons sugar", "1 1/2 cups buttermilk", "2 eggs, lightly beaten", "6 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil, plus more for greasing griddle", "3 cups freshly shucked corn kernels, from about 4 ears", "1 small jalape\u00f1o chile, finely chopped, or to taste", "3 tablespoons finely sliced chives or scallions", "1 1/2 cups red onion, finely diced", "1 1/2 cups bell peppers, finely diced, preferably a mix of colors", "1 1/2 cups firm-ripe tomatoes, finely diced, preferably a mix of colors", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 small jalape\u00f1o chile, finely chopped, or to taste", "Juice of 2 limes, more to taste", "1 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves, for garnish", "1 cup crumbled queso fresco, for garnish (may substitute mild feta)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the batter:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir together cornmeal, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar in a large mixing bowl.
