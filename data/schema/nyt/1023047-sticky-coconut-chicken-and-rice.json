{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sticky Coconut Chicken and Rice", "description": "This comforting one-pot chicken dish features fragrant coconut rice infused with aromatic ginger, garlic and scallion, and studded with toasty cashews. The cashews soften as the rice steams, adding subtle nuttiness to the dish. Chicken thighs absorb the coconut milk as they cook, which keeps the meat tender and juicy. Fresh chopped cilantro brightens the dish, while hot sauce adds nice heat and tang to balance the creamy, rich and slightly sweet rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/17/dining/kc-sticky-coconut-chicken-and-rice/merlin_202696401_f3bea8d6-0e32-4f31-a0ba-5238e30c50a9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, one pot, poultry, main course", "keywords": "cashew, chicken, coconut milk, dutch oven, ginger, rice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 8722}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, each thigh cut into 2 equal-size pieces", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 1/2 cups short-grain white rice, rinsed until water runs clear", "1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth\u00a0", "1 (13.5-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "1 yellow bell pepper, cored, seeded and chopped (\u00bd-inch pieces)", "1/2 cup roasted cashews, coarsely chopped", "3 scallions, green and white parts, thinly sliced (\u00bd packed cup)", "2 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro", "Hot sauce, for serving\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
