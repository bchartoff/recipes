Some roasted potatoes or a potato salad would do well here if you\u2019re serving this as part of a larger spread. Not to be confused with mango chutney, hot mango pickle is a traditional jarred condiment made by preserving mangoes and a variety of hot spices. It\u2019s used most commonly in South Asia, and provides the sour and spicy qualities that give these ribs that special oomph of flavor.
