It is a simple treatment she obtained from a woman in Corfu, an island off the coast of Greece in the Ionian Sea. It makes the best of a medley of vegetables \u2013 and the recipe can be varied according to what is on hand. \"The combination of intense, good flavors \u2013 charred tomatoes, Greek olive oil and the herb accents of parsley, dill and mint \u2013 is wonderful, she says. Imported feta cheese (this <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10427-roasted-feta-with-honey\">roasted version</a> would be lovely), oily black olives and crusty bread are the best accompaniments.
