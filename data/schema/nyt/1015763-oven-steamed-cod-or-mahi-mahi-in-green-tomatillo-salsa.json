Add the tomatillo pur\u00e9e, and stir constantly until it thickens and begins to stick to the pan, about 5 minutes. When you run your spoon down the middle of the pan it should leave a canal. Stir in the stock, bring to a simmer, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, stirring often, until it has reduced by about a quarter and coats the front and the back of a spoon like cream. Keep warm.\n"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Line a sheet pan with foil and oil the foil. Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper and lay on the foil. Place a pan of just boiled water on the floor of your oven and place the baking sheet with the fish in the oven on the middle rack. Bake 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets, until the fish is opaque on the surface and you can pull it apart with a fork. Remove from the heat, transfer to plates or a platter, and spoon on the sauce. Garnish with cilantro and lemon or lime wedges, and serve. You will have some sauce left over.\n"}]}
