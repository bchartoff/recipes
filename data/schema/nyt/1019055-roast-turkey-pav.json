{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Turkey Pav", "description": "This dish was inspired in equal measures by a cluttered refrigerator on the day after the Thanksgiving, and the pav bhaji of western India \u2014 a gloriously spiced mash of vegetables served with buttery, toasted buns. It works beautifully with roast turkey meat, cut into small pieces, though it's ideal for scraps of meat pulled off the turkey carcass after making stock, giving them a second life and infusing them with flavor. Serve the dish with garnishes of cilantro and red onion on the side, allowing people to determine their own ratios, or take control and garnish the whole pan yourself. Either way, don't skip buttering and toasting those rolls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/22/dining/22LEFTOVERSJP3/22LEFTOVERSJP3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sandwiches", "keywords": "garam masala, serrano chile, turkey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons grapeseed oil", "1/2 pound roast turkey meat, chopped finely, or pulled from carcass after <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013935-turkey-broth\">making stock</a>", "Kosher salt", "1 white onion, chopped", "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 1/2-inch piece ginger, finely chopped", "1 serrano chile, seeded and finely chopped", "1 beefsteak tomato, chopped", "1/3 cup frozen peas (optional)", "1/4 teaspoon turmeric", "1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala", "1 lime, cut into 4 wedges", "4 potato rolls", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, room temperature", "Handful of cilantro, chopped", "1/4 red onion, finely chopped (about 2 tablespoons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, then add pulled turkey and let cook until it becomes light brown and crisp in places, stirring occasionally.
