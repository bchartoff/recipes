{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Aioli (Garlic Mayonnaise)", "description": "The renowned chef Alice Waters makes her aioli in the most inefficient and old-fashioned way possible: using a mortar and pestle to mash the garlic, a fork to whip up the emulsion and no lemon juice, vinegar or any other acid at all. It was the best mayonnaise I've ever tasted, but then again, she did use a wonderfully perfumed olive oil. For this recipe, you should do the same.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 cup.", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "condiments, dips and spreads", "keywords": "garlic, eggs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 96}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 186, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "53 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cloves garlic (or to taste), peeled", "Salt", "1 egg yolk, lightly beaten, at room temperature", "3/4 cup olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mash the garlic to a smooth paste in a mortar with a pinch of salt; set aside 1/3 of the paste. To the rest of the garlic add 1/2 teaspoon room-temperature water, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the egg yolk, stirring well. Slowly whisk in the olive oil, a few drops at a time. As the mixture begins to thicken, begin adding the oil in a slow, steady stream. If the aioli becomes too \nthick, thin it with a bit of water, and continue. After all the oil has been mixed in, taste for salt and garlic, and adjust accordingly.
