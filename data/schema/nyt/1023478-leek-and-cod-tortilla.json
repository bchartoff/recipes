The addition of paprika-seasoned cod adds unexpected bites of smoky flavor, and cutting the potatoes into small cubes allows the tortilla to cook faster. The leek- and garlic-infused cooking oil is used to make a flavorful aioli to accompany the omelet. Store leftover flavored oil in the fridge and use it to make salad dressings, to saut\u00e9 greens or fry eggs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/06/dining/kc-leek-and-cod-tortilla-rex/merlin_213609879_98e1293f-6919-4cd5-8b9d-c3f2afc5f1da-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "cod, leek, mayonnaise, omelet, russet potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 412}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound russet potatoes (2 medium), peeled and cut into \u00bd-inch cubes (about 3 cups)", "2 medium leeks, light green and white parts only, sliced crosswise \u00bc inch thick (about 3 cups)", "3 teaspoons minced garlic", "4 ounces skinless cod fillet, cut into \u00bc-inch cubes", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "Salt and black pepper", "10 large eggs", "1/3 cup mayonnaise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium until shimmering.
