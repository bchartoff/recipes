{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coffee and Cream Coffee Cake", "description": "In most classic coffee cakes, cinnamon plays a starring role, but this recipe puts coffee flavor front and center thanks to the addition of brewed coffee and espresso powder (or instant espresso). Espresso powder adds strong flavor, and it\u2019s fine enough to dissolve completely so you don\u2019t get any crunchy bits. A ribbon of cream cheese runs through the center of the cake, complementing the coffee flavor like a splash of cream in a cup of coffee.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/dining/em-coffee-cream-coffee-cake/em-coffee-cream-coffee-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "brown sugar, butter, coffee, cream cheese, eggs, espresso coffee powder, flour, oats, sour cream, sugar, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/50 grams old-fashioned oats", "1/3 cup/75 grams light or dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon espresso powder (or instant espresso)", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "10 tablespoons/140 grams cold unsalted butter (1 1/4 sticks)", "12 ounces/340 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "Nonstick cooking spray", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons espresso powder (or instant espresso)", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), at room temperature", "3/4 cup/165 grams light or dark brown sugar", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters coffee, cooled", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters sour cream", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, as needed for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the streusel: In a medium bowl, stir the flour, oats, brown sugar, espresso powder, baking powder and salt to combine.
