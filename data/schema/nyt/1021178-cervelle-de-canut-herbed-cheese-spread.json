The simple, savory mixture of fromage blanc with shallots, garlic and other seasonings is a mainstay in Lyon, where it often appears with the cheese course. (Or it may be the cheese course.) The name means silk worker's brain, a mysterious reference to the days when silk weaving made Lyon rich. This version is set apart by its lavish use of fresh herbs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pete Wells"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/22/dining/21Bufordrex2/merlin_173545842_7e89bf39-5961-4e20-8adf-5de30b0b9461-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "snack, dips and spreads, finger foods, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "fromage blanc, garlic, herbs, shallot, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 140}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh, whole-milk, full-fat fromage blanc (ideally from a farm)", "1 small shallot, peeled and roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh herb leaves (such as dill, tarragon, chives, chervil and parsley)", "1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon red wine vinegar", "1/2 small garlic clove", "3/4 teaspoon salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using farm-fresh cheese, line a sieve with two layers of cheesecloth and place over a bowl.
