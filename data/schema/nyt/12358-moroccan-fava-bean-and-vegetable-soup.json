{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Moroccan Fava Bean and Vegetable Soup", "description": "When I am planning a Passover menu I look to the Sephardic traditions of the Mediterranean. The Sephardim were the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula; they had a rich culture and lived in harmony with Christians and Muslims until the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions at the end of the 15th century, when all non-Christians were expelled from Spain and Portugal. The Sephardim were welcomed in Turkey, and many went to Greece, North Africa and the Middle East as well. Throughout the Mediterranean, springtime is the season for spinach and other greens, artichokes and fava beans, and these vegetables make delicious appearances at Passover meals. This dish is inspired by the fresh fava bean soup that Rivka Levy-Mellul, author of \u201cLa Cuisine Juive Marocaine,\u201d remembers as the first course of her childhood Seders in Morocco. The authentic dish is a substantial soup made with quite a lot of meat, but I\u2019ve made a vegetarian version. I expected the fava beans to color this soup a pale green, but the other vegetables  \u2014 the carrots, leeks, turnips and onion \u2014 and especially the turmeric contribute just as much, and the color of the soup is more of a burnt orange.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/02/health/nutrition/02recipehealth/02recipehealth-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fava beans, leek, turnip, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 105, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "885 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds fresh fava beans or 1/2 pound frozen double-peeled (2 cups)", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 leeks, white and light green parts only, cleaned and sliced", "1 large onion, chopped", "2 medium or large carrots, peeled and diced", "1 stalk celery, chopped", "2 medium turnips, peeled and diced", "1 small potato (about 4 ounces), peeled and diced", "2 quarts water, vegetable stock or chicken stock", "Salt to taste", "A bouquet garni made with a couple of sprigs of parsley, a bay leaf and several sprigs of cilantro", "1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper", "1/2 teaspoon turmeric"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Skin the fresh favas: bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.
