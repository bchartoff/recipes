From one section, break off a ball about 1 inch in diameter and set aside. Divide the remaining part of that section into two, rolling each into a rope a few inches long, with some parts of the rope fatter than the others. (Do this by gently rolling the dough with your hand outstretched, with only the three middle fingers touching the dough, so that the dough between your fingers is puffier than the rest.) Cross the two \u201cbones\u201d in an \u201cX\u201d across a round of bread, and place the small ball of dough in the center. Repeat with remaining dough. Set the breads aside to rise for one hour. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The bread may be baked plain, or gently brushed with egg white and sprinkled with sesame seeds.
