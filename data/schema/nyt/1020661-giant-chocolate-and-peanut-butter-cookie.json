{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Giant Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cookie", "description": "This shortbread is like a huge, sliceable Girl Scout cookie. (You\u2019re welcome!) An easy shortbread is topped with a layer of peanut butter frosting, blanketed with a thick chocolate glaze, then chilled until set. Brown sugar helps keep the shortbread soft, and coconut oil does the same for the chocolate coating, so the whole thing is easy to cut with a knife and eat with a fork. Be sure to use bar chocolate, not chips \u2014 which don\u2019t melt as evenly \u2014 so your chocolate glaze ends up shiny and smooth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/21/dining/ejm-chocolate-peanut-butter-shortbread/ejm-chocolate-peanut-butter-shortbread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch cookie (about 12 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, cookies and bars", "keywords": "butter, coconut oil, confectioners' sugar, heavy cream, light brown sugar, peanut butter, semisweet chocolate, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 252}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1/2 cup/110 grams light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick), at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters creamy peanut butter (not natural)", "1 1/3 cups/135 grams sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "12 ounces/340 grams chopped semisweet bar chocolate", "1 tablespoon coconut oil", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
