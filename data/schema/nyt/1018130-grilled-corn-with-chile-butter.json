{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Corn With Chile Butter", "description": "In South Africa, charred ears of corn (called braai mielies) are year-round, smoky-sweet roadside snacks. This version is a side dish for the American summer, when corn and grilling are both in season. The cobs are slicked with butter and sparked with chile heat; in South Africa, they would be served alongside a pile of charcoal-grilled lamb chops or steak or giant prawns, or all of the above. For a more rustic effect (and more effort), use the corn husks as a wrapper instead of aluminum foil. Soak the unshucked cobs in cold water for at least 15 minutes. Peel back the husks but do not detach them from the cobs; remove all the cornsilk. After rubbing on the butter, rearrange the husks around each cob and tie in place with twine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/dining/25AFRICA-SPICY-BUTTERED-CORN/25AFRICA-SPICY-BUTTERED-CORN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "corn, fall, summer, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 stick butter, softened", "1 fresh hot red chile, such as Fresno, Holland or cherry, seeded and minced", "1 teaspoon minced garlic (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "Hot sauce to taste", "8 to 12 cobs of corn", "Lime wedges for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a grill for high-heat cooking.
