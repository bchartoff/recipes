{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb Ice Cream With a Caramel Swirl", "description": "This ice cream is chock-full of sweet bits, but with enough satiny frozen custard to savor between the chunks. To keep the rhubarb from freezing into tooth-breaking fruity ice cubes, stew it with plenty of sugar, which keeps the fruit soft. The technique works with any summer fruit, though it\u2019s especially nice with rhubarb, or gooseberries for that matter, both of which need a lot of sugar to tame their squint-inducing acid content. But you can substitute strawberries, apricots, cherries, peaches or plums as the summer fruit season progresses, adjusting the sugar depending upon the sweetness of the fruit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/15/dining/rhubarb-icecream/rhubarb-icecream-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "One scant quart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dessert, milk, rhubarb, sugar, nut-free, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 88}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 and 1/2 cups whole milk", "1 and 3/4 cup plus 6 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Pinch fine sea salt", "1 vanilla bean, split and scraped", "4 large egg yolks, lightly beaten", "1 and 1/2 cups sour cream", "3/4 pound rhubarb, cut into 1/2-inch dice", "1/2 cup heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, whisk together the milk, 3/4 cup sugar, the salt, the vanilla bean seeds and its pod.
