{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caldo de Costilla (Colombian Beef Rib Soup)", "description": "This hearty soup from the Colombian Andes uses a handful of ingredients and takes only a few minutes of active time to put together. It\u2019s traditionally served for breakfast (especially after a night of dancing and drinking) along with hot chocolate and arepas, but it\u2019s hearty enough to serve for any meal. Because of its relatively neutral flavor profile, it\u2019s good to make in large batches (the beef broth can easily be doubled or tripled through Step 4) to be doctored into different dishes (see Tip).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
