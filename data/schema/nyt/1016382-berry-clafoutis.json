{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Berry Clafoutis", "description": "Clafoutis, as you may must know by now, are among my favorite vehicles for seasonal fruit. I love the way blueberries and blackberries bleed into the batter as this bakes. Let it cool for about a half- hour, or completely, before you serve it, and be careful when you cut into it, as the berries can splatter when they\u2019re warm. My clafoutis are not very sweet, and I enjoy them for breakfast as well as for dessert. If you\u2019re making this for a dinner, you can make it several hours ahead. The leftovers will keep for about 3 days in the refrigerator.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/20/science/23recipehealth/23recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner", "keywords": "dessert, halal, kosher, low-sodium, vegetarian, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 267}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 192, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "78 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/450 grams mixed blueberries and blackberries (or use just one type), rinsed and drained on paper towels", "2 tablespoons kirsch, eau de vie de myrtille or cr\u00e8me de cassis (optional)", "7 tablespoons/105 grams sugar, preferably organic", "About 1/3 cup/40 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "About 1/3 cup/35 grams almond flour", "3 extra-large eggs (165 grams)", "1 vanilla bean, scraped, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of salt", "About 2/3 cup/165 grams low-fat yogurt or kefir"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss berries in a medium bowl with the kirsch, eau de vie or cr\u00e8me de cassis and 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and let sit for 30 minutes.
