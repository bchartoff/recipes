{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Chicken With Green Garlic, Herbs and Potatoes", "description": "Green garlic has a distinct green, grassy garlicky character that is pungent but not overpowering. After an initial peeling of the outer layer, both green and white parts of the stalk can be used, and if you cannot find green garlic, a combination of scallion and garlic chives will make for a reasonable substitute. Roasting the potatoes under the chicken means they catch the infused drippings, ensuring big flavor in this simple yet complete dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/13/dining/08tanisrex2-chicken/08tanisrex2-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "chicken, green garlic, potato, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 129}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3- to 4-pound) roasting chicken", "Salt and pepper", "3 pounds medium yellow-fleshed potatoes, such as Yukon Gold (about 8 potatoes)", "4 to 6 green garlic stalks, or use a combination of scallion and garlic chives", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Handful of thyme, rosemary and sage sprigs", "1/2 cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken inside and out with salt and pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
