You\u2019ll combine strawberries, rhubarb vanilla and sugar over heat and then follow standard canning instructions, laid out in the recipe\u2019s instructions. It all leads up to summer sweetness in a jar that you\u2019ve made yourself. And don\u2019t worry: if your preserves are on the runny side, just call them syrup.
