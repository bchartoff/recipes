{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Homemade Sour Bulgur Trahana From Ikaria", "description": "Trahana is a wheat product that is eaten throughout Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean. There are many versions, some made with milk, usually from goats or sheep that is called sweet trahana, some with a combination of milk and yogurt, called sour trahana, and even a lenten version made with vegetable pulp. The liquid is combined with wheat \u2013 bulgur, semolina, or a mix of semolina and flour \u2013 and made into a dry dough (if using flour) or simmered until it is a thick porridge. Then it is spread out on netting and dried in the sun. Once thoroughly dry it is broken up into granules that can range in size from bulgurlike morsels to small pellets. You can find imported Greek trahana in Greek markets. I found five different types in my local Greek market in Los Angeles and each one behaves a little bit differently when you cook it. It is easy to make yourself, as I found when I made this recipe from Diane Kochilas\u2019s wonderful new cookbook \u201cIkaria: Lessons on Food, Life, and Longevity From the Greek Island Where People Forget to Die.\u201d This is the trahana that I used for all of this week\u2019s Recipes for Health. I am happy to have this new staple on hand in my pantry.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/21/science/20recipeforhealthtrahana/20recipeforhealthtrahana-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "1 1/4 pounds trahana, about 18 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek, mediterranean, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 124, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "163 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups / 18 ounces coarse bulgur", "1 cup plain Greek whole-milk yogurt", "1 cup whole cow\u2019s milk", "1 cup whole goat\u2019s milk", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring to prevent bulgur from sticking to the bottom of pan.
