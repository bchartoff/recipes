{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pepper-and-Sausage Cornbread Dressing", "description": "This dressing combines corn bread, turkey broth, three kinds of pepper and a healthy scattering of fiery sausage for a Thanksgiving dish that is crunchy on top, moist within and alive with flavor. The copious use of that turkey broth, or a good chicken broth, is crucial here; also necessary is an understanding that the cooking should last long enough to crisp the exterior without burning it, while not going on so long as to dry out the dish. When in doubt, add a splash more broth.
