{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemony Cranberry Relish", "description": "Cranberry relish using a whole orange is a classic, but here, a whole lemon \u2014 pith and all \u2014 acts as the bitter, acerbic edge that your Thanksgiving plate needs. Try to find a thin-skinned lemon, which will prevent the relish from skewing too bitter. (Give it a squeeze before buying. Thin-skinned lemons will yield slightly under pressure, whereas thick-skinned lemons will feel hard.) This confetti of a condiment looks beautiful as well, almost like stained glass, with its jeweled, ruby gleam. Definitely make this the night before Thanksgiving to get it out of the way, then store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to eat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15BEGINNERREX6-CRANBERRY/15BEGINNERREX6-CRANBERRY-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, condiments, side dish", "keywords": "cranberry, lemon, sugar, fall, thanksgiving, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 377}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (12-ounce) bag fresh cranberries (3 cups)", "1 lemon, preferably thin-skinned, coarsely chopped and seeded", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse and drain the cranberries, then pick out and discard any squishy ones.
