Hold the sac with one hand and with the other reach inside and pull away the head and tentacles. With your fingers, scrape away the dark skin on the outside of the sac under cold running water. It will come away easily. Inside the sac is a transparent cartilege; pull this out and discard it. Thoroughly rinse the inside of the sac. Cut the tentacles from the head above the eyes. Remove the ink sac above the eyes and squeeze ink into a container. Reserve the tentacles and cut them in one-and-a-half-inch pieces.
