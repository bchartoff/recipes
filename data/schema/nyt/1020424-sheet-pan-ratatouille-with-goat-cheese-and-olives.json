{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Ratatouille With Goat Cheese and Olives", "description": "Cooking ratatouille on a sheet pan in the oven isn\u2019t just easier than cooking it in a pot on the stove, it\u2019s also better: richer and more deeply caramelized in flavor. To make it, the vegetables are slicked with plenty of olive oil, then roasted until tender and browned, their juices mingling and condensing. Toward the end of the cooking time, goat cheese and olives are sprinkled on top. The cheese melts and becomes creamy, while the olives heat up and turn plump and tangy. Serve this as a meatless main dish, with crusty bread and more goat cheese, or as a hearty side dish to a simple roast chicken or fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/dining/30apperex/30apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "eggplant, goat cheese, olives, tomato, zucchini, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 457}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1 3/4 pounds zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch slices (about 7 cups)", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "6 thyme sprigs", "4 rosemary sprigs", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "Fine sea salt, as needed", "2 pounds eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 10 cups)", "2 medium red bell peppers, sliced into 1/2-inch slices (about 3 cups)", "3 cups cherry tomatoes (12 ounces)", "8 ounces goat cheese, crumbled", "3/4 cup Castelvetrano or other good-quality olives, crushed, pitted, and torn into pieces", "Lemon wedges, for serving", "1/2 cup basil leaves, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees, and arrange two racks in the top and bottom thirds."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On one rimmed 13-by-17-inch sheet pan,\u00a0toss together onion slices, zucchini, 1/4 cup oil, 3 thyme springs, 2 rosemary sprigs, 3 garlic cloves and 1/2 teaspoon salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a second rimmed baking sheet, toss together eggplant, red peppers, 1/4 cup oil, 3 thyme sprigs, 2 rosemary sprig, 3 garlic cloves and 3/4 teaspoon salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place one tray on the top rack, and a second on the bottom rack of the oven.
