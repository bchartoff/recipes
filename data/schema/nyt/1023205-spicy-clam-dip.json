{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Clam Dip", "description": "In this chile-flecked take on a classic 1950s clam dip, the cream cheese-based mixture is spooned into a gratin dish, sprinkled with Parmesan and baked until the topping melts and the dip turns molten and savory. Canned clams are traditional here, providing a gentle saline note and nubby texture without an assertive flavor. If you\u2019re starting with cream cheese straight from the fridge, soften it briefly in the microwave before adding it to the bowl; cold cream cheese is a lot harder to mix.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/25/dining/20Apperex/20Apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "clams, cream cheese, mozzarella, labor day, memorial day, super bowl", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 297}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces cream cheese, softened", "1/2 cup sour cream or plain Greek yogurt", "2 (6.5-ounce) cans whole clams (1 cup), coarsely chopped (save the clam juice)", "1/2 cup packaged, low-moisture grated mozzarella\u00a0", "1/4 cup finely chopped parsley", "3 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions, plus more for garnish", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded (if desired) and finely chopped", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce", "1 teaspoon hot sauce, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon fish sauce (optional) or clam juice,\u00a0plus more to taste", "Salt, if needed, and freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan", "Potato chips, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
