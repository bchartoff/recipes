Wrap it all into a tightly sealed parcel, put it on a baking sheet and roast it. In truth, any fish can be cooked like this, and you can play around with the herbs, depending on what is available. This is a very good-natured recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/10/dining/salmonthyme/salmonthyme-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fish, salmon, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 153}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 794, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "57 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "64 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "800 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1 4-pound salmon, cleaned and scaled, head and tail removed", "2 scallions, trimmed", "1 small bunch (about 1/2 cup) fresh thyme", "6 tablespoons melted butter", "1 tablespoon sea salt", "1/3 cup sliced almonds", "Juice of half a lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
