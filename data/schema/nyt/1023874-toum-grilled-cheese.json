{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Toum Grilled Cheese\u00a0", "description": "Cheese manousheh, a topped flatbread found throughout the Levant, is often served with wild cucumber pickles and a side of fluffy toum, a sauce made by combining garlic, lemon juice, salt and oil, for dipping. This grilled cheese hits those notes, skipping a trip to a Lebanese bakery. Slathering the bread with toum instead of butter instantly gives it garlic bread vibes. Though you can purchase toum at many supermarkets and Middle Eastern specialty stores, making it at home gives it a more vibrant punch. It lasts for months and can be used anywhere a tangy, garlicky wallop is needed. Use in salad dressings, as a rub on roasted meats, as a sandwich condiment, or even as a dip for crudit\u00e9s.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ham El-Waylly"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/27/multimedia/he-toum-grilled-cheese-mghb/he-toum-grilled-cheese-mghb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 sandwich, plus 1 \u00be cups toum", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "bread, garlic, grapeseed oil, lemon juice, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 43}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium head of garlic, peeled (about 12 cloves)", "2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon), plus more to taste", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 1/2 cups neutral oil, like grapeseed oil", "2 slices bread, preferably from a rustic loaf, no more than 1/2-inch thick", "3 slices Muenster cheese", "4 cornichons, thinly sliced lengthwise", "2 tablespoons toum (prepared or homemade), plus more for dipping\u00a0", "Kosher salt\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the toum (or proceed to Step 4, if using store-bought toum): Place garlic, lemon juice, kosher salt and 1 tablespoon water in a tall, narrow container; blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
