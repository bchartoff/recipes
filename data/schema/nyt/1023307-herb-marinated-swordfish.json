(Like many proteins, it can get tough if overcooked.) Rather than marinating in advance, here the fish is marinated after cooking: Cooked in a skillet until golden, the steaks are then left to soak up a piquant pan sauce while warm. The sauce imparts the punchy flavors of briny capers and citrus, while the olive oil keeps the steaks moist.
