{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Stir-Fried Greens", "description": "Wok hei, or the \u201cbreath of a wok,\u201d is the elusive smokiness found in restaurant-style dishes that rely on high-powered burners and a skilled hand to achieve it. To create a similar flavor at home, I rely on a hand-held blowtorch, which I use here for simple stir-fried greens. I recommend using either a butane canister with a high-output torch head or a propane canister with a trigger-start head. If you do not have a wok, a heavy cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet can be used instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
