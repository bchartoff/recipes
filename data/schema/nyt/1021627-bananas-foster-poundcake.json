But what if we told you that you could have your bananas Foster baked into cake and glazed with that same sauce? This slightly dense, buttery cake is delicious warm, and super moist. Take care when flamb\u00e9ing \u2014 keep a lid nearby to smother any flames \u2014 or skip it altogether: Bypass adding the alcohol in Step 3 and simply reduce the sauce on the stovetop. And don\u2019t forget to add that scoop of ice cream and a dollop of fresh whipped cream. You\u2019ll thank us later.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/06/dining/mp-bananas-foster-poundcake/merlin_179305296_adb5899f-8141-4b3b-a312-2a10d3d0d92c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "banana, buttermilk, cinnamon, eggs, sour cream, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 431}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "3 cups/600 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "3 cups/375 grams self-rising flour", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters sour cream, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature", "6 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "4 ripe bananas", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1/4 cup/55 grams light or dark brown sugar (not packed)", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 nip bottle/50 milliliters dark liquor (such as cognac, bourbon or whiskey) or buttermilk (about a scant 3 1/2 tablespoons)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Ice cream or whipped cream and candied pralines, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees and generously coat a 10-inch/12-cup Bundt cake pan with nonstick cooking spray."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the bananas Foster filling: Peel the bananas and cut them crosswise into 1/2-inch slices.
