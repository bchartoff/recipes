Chad Shaner cooked it for staff meals when he was a line cook at Union Square Cafe in Manhattan. It was, he said shyly when The Times talked to him in 2013, one of the restaurant staff's favorites. \u201cEveryone loves taco day,\u201d he said. The recipe is not particularly Mexican. Shaner hails from Smyrna, Del., and served in the Navy before he went to cooking school. He makes a forceful kind of American food that borrows its flavors from wherever they are strongest. His fish tacos, he said, are something he cooked up one night with his brother, Andy, a bartender. \u201cWe were looking for intense flavor,\u201d he said of the Cajun-style rub they used on the fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/02/magazine/02eat1/mag-02Eat-t-000_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick", "keywords": "corn tortillas, fish, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 931}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 764, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "1016 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons chile powder", "2 tablespoons garlic powder", "2 tablespoons paprika", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or to taste", "1 1/2 pounds firm white fish fillets, like cod or red snapper, skinless", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 1/2 cups sour cream", "2 chipotle chilies in adobo, finely chopped, or more to taste", "12 white corn tortillas", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, like grapeseed or canola", "6 scallions, trimmed and cut into 4-inch lengths", "5 radishes, trimmed and sliced thin", "8 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated", "2 limes, cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350.
