{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheddar-Stuffed Turkey Burger With Avocado", "description": "The secret to keeping lean turkey juicy as a burger? Adding fat. The burgers in this recipe, stuffed with cheese and a bit of butter, are moist, flavorful and, best of all, hold together and flip easily. These are best cooked on a flat-top griddle, burger-joint style, or you can use a large, wide skillet (like cast-iron) if that\u2019s what you have. Both give the outside of these burgers an irresistible sear that keeps the juice and flavor inside the burger, not dripping through grill grates. Finally, Hawaiian buns are a must. Their softness and subtle sweetness give these burgers a universal appeal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/dining/sc-turkey-burger/sc-turkey-burger-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, burgers", "keywords": "avocado, cheddar, ground turkey, hamburger buns, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 229}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 661, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "736 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds lean ground turkey", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon dried parsley", "1 egg, lightly beaten", "1 tablespoon milk", "2 tablespoons butter, plus more for cooking", "5 (1-ounce) slices sharp Cheddar or horseradish Cheddar", "4 Hawaiian hamburger buns", "1 to 2 firm-ripe avocado, thinly sliced", "Mayonnaise or other burger toppings (pickles, lettuce, tomato, mustard), to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the turkey, salt, pepper and parsley in a large bowl and mix with a fork or clean hands to season evenly.
