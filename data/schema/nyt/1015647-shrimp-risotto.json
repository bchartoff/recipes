It came to The Times in 2009, part of Emily Weinstein\u2019s column on learning to cook. It worked for her, even though she didn\u2019t prepare any of the ingredients ahead of time \u2014 or stir constantly as so many risotto recipes demand. Feel free to adapt the recipe as she did, substituting packaged seafood stock for the homemade shrimp stock, and chopped basil for the basil-infused oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Weinstein"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "arborio rice, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 201}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 486, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1227 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups shrimp stock", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1/3 cup minced shallots", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 cup Arborio rice", "1 cup dry white wine", "Coarse salt and freshly ground white pepper", "1 pound shrimp, shelled and cut into bite-sized pieces", "1 cup grape tomatoes, quartered", "Basil oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring the stock to a simmer in a medium saucepan; keep at a gentle simmer."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, heat a wide saucepan or deep skillet over medium heat.
