A pound of pasta is a lot to toss around, especially with 2 bunches of spinach in the mix, so save that extra quarter-box for your next pot of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016031-pasta-e-fagioli\">pasta e fagioli</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/18/dining/15Pasta-Garlicy-Greens-a/merlin_171317172_21b69335-b095-419e-bd54-302ddf6fa0dc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, pastas, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "butter, capers, garlic, parmesan, pasta, pistachio, spinach, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2127}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "12 ounces mezze rigatoni or other short pasta", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup roasted salted pistachios, almonds or hazelnuts, chopped", "4 garlic cloves, chopped", "2 tablespoons capers, drained", "12 ounces spinach, stems trimmed to 1-inch length, or Swiss chard, trimmed and chopped", "Grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
