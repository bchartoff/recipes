{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Curried Roast Chicken With Grapefruit, Honey and Thyme", "description": "Sweet and savory curry powder is combined with honey and a pleasantly tart grapefruit juice to create a rich glaze for your above-average weeknight bird. Roasting the chicken low and slow keeps the meat moist, and basting frequently prevents the caramelization of the sauce from scorching. Serve with a side of greens such as spinach, kale or Swiss chard that have been saut\u00e9ed in lots of garlic and oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/28/dining/ch-curried-roast-chicken/ch-curried-roast-chicken-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, curry powder, grapefruit juice, honey, thyme, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 73}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 660, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1029 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 1/2-pound) whole chicken", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/3 cup grapefruit juice, freshly squeezed, if possible", "1/4 cup honey", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "1 tablespoon finely chopped thyme"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
