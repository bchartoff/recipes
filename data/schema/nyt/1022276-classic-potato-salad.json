{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Potato Salad", "description": "The recipe for this Southern classic came from the chef Millie Peartree\u2019s mother, Millie Bell. The sweet relish melds with the creamy potatoes for a deep, balanced flavor. Onion powder adds savory notes without the texture of diced onion, which could overpower the dish. Make sure that your eggs are rinsed thoroughly, so no pieces of shell remain, and that your potatoes are uniformly cut in roughly 1-inch cubes so they all finish cooking at the same time. (Millie Bell used her thumb as a measure.) And, most important of all, don\u2019t overcook the potatoes: You want potato salad, not mashed potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/10/dining/mp-potato-salad-reshoot/mp-potato-salad-reshoot-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "8 servings (2 1/2 quarts)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "side dish", "keywords": "egg, mayonnaise, potato, potato salad, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, super bowl, tailgate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1027}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds russet, Yukon Gold or Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup mayonnaise", "1/4 cup sweet relish", "1 tablespoon yellow mustard", "1 teaspoon granulated onion or onion powder", "6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and diced small", "2 celery stalks (optional)", "Sweet paprika, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set the potatoes in a large pot; add 1 tablespoon salt and cover with cold water by 1 inch.
