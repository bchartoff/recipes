{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pistachio Baklava", "description": "This Turkish-style baklava tastes deeply and richly of pistachio nuts and butter, without the spices, honey or aromatics found in other versions. It has a purity of flavor that, while still quite sweet, is never cloying. This very traditional recipe is from one of the most celebrated baklava shops in Istanbul. Feel free to substitute other nuts for the pistachios, particularly walnuts and hazelnuts. Or use a combination of nuts. Once baked, this baklava will last for several days, but it is at its absolute best within 24 hours of baking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/20/dining/20APPEJP4/20APPEJP4-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "36 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "turkish", "recipeCategory": "pastries", "keywords": "dessert, phyllo, pistachio", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 224}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 240, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "63 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups/300 grams shelled pistachio nuts", "4 sticks/2 cups/454 grams unsalted butter\u00a0", "1 pound phyllo dough, defrosted overnight in the refrigerator", "3 cups/600 grams sugar \u00a0", "Juice of 1/2 lemon, more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, pulse the pistachios until coarsely ground (or you can chop them by hand until very finely chopped).
