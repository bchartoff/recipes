{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Carrot and Red Lentil Ragout", "description": "Somehow, over the centuries, the word ragout (which in 17th-century France meant anything that stimulated appetite) has come to signify a dish of sturdy consolation. Nearly any simmered food, be it meat, vegetable, fish or fowl, can be called a ragout, although in France, it is generally assumed that the main ingredients will be of a uniform chunk cut into slightly smaller than bite-size pieces. This spicy carrot and lentil ragout can be served first as a main course and later extended with coconut milk or chicken broth to make a soup. Serve it over rice to temper the heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/17/dining/17COOKING-REDLENTIL-CARROTRAGOUT2/17COOKING-REDLENTIL-CARROTRAGOUT2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "carrot, chili powder, red lentils, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 826}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 339, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "855 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 medium onion, sliced thin", "3/4 teaspoon ancho chili powder", "3/4 teaspoon chipotle chili powder", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1 cup red lentils", "5 cups chicken stock"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
