The scallions add sweetness and crunch to the delicate fish, flavored with soy sauce and fish sauce for an extra salty depth. Then it\u2019s all dolloped with a tart, creamy yogurt sauce that\u2019s both pungent from the garlic and cool and crisp from the chopped cucumber. Serve this dish with more sliced cucumber on the side and some pita bread or a baguette to soak up any remaining sauce.
