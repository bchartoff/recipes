{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tahini-Parmesan Pasta Salad", "description": "Many traditional pasta salad recipes call for a heavy mayonnaise-based dressing, but this one combines tahini and Parmesan for a lighter, umami-packed dressing that can be used on noodles, salad greens, asparagus, grilled chicken or grains. Tahini and Parmesan may be a surprising duo, but they naturally work well together because tahini, which is made from sesame seeds, amplifies the cheese\u2019s rich, nutty flavor. To add even more complexity, cherry tomatoes are blistered in a skillet to concentrate their sweetness and acidity. As with any good pasta salad, this one benefits from adding fresh scallions and mint right before serving, plus toasted sesame seeds and shards of Parmesan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/17/dining/as-tahini-pasta-salad/as-tahini-pasta-salad-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weekday, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, grape tomato, parmesan, pasta, pasta salad, tahini, spring, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1970}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound ridged or curly pasta, such as fusilli or gemelli", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "2 pints cherry or grape tomatoes (about 1 1/4 pounds)", "1/3 cup tahini", "3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus 1/4 cup chopped or shaved", "1/2 cup packed mint leaves, torn if large", "3 scallions, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
