It is also home to one of the largest Portuguese-American communities in the United States and the source of one of the nation\u2019s most flavorful hyphenated cuisines. Matthew Jennings, the chef and an owner of the forthcoming Townsman restaurant in Boston, pays homage to that cooking with a New Bedford-style Thanksgiving dressing made with local Massachusetts quahog clams and the Portuguese sausage known as chouri\u00e7o. Fresh chorizo is an acceptable substitution, but canned clams are not.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19MASSACHUSETTES/19MASSACHUSETTES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "portuguese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "clams, country bread, sausage, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 36}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 317, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "613 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups stale country bread, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes (1 1/4 pounds)", "1 pound fresh chouri\u00e7o sausage (or use fresh chorizo), casing removed", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 large white onion, diced (2 cups)", "4 stalks celery, diced (1 1/2 cups)", "2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme", "1 tablespoon minced fresh sage", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons whole grain mustard", "1/2 bunch fresh parsley, chopped (2/3 cup)", "1 dozen shucked and chopped quahog clams, liquor reserved (see note)", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
