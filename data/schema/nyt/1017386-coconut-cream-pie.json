{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Cream Pie", "description": "Coconut cream pie can assume all kinds of variations, with coconut extracts or coconut cream added to enhance the flavor. My mother\u2019s version, which I grew up eating, is a more subtle, custardy version, with a balance of coconut and vanilla. It uses an old-fashioned technique called scalding, popular in the days before milk was pasteurized. Here it is used to change the texture of the milk and enhance its flavor. You can use the same sweetened, untoasted coconut to top the pie that you use in the filling, but the unsweetened, toasted coconut lends some nutty depth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/dining/coconut-cream-pie-horizontal/coconut-cream-pie-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, flaked coconut, pie shell, unsweetened coconut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 126}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 378, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "313 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 Prepared 9-inch pie shell", "2 cups milk", "3 egg yolks", "1/2 cup/100 grams sugar", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 1/2 tablespoons/20 grams cornstarch", "1 tablespoon butter, melted", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla", "1 cup/98 grams sweetened, flaked coconut", "1/2 cup/49 grams unsweetened coconut", "3 egg whites", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "6 tablespoons/75 grams sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Partially blind-bake the pie shell: Heat oven to 425 degrees.
