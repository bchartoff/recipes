I find it\u2019s the most efficient way to wilt them quickly and evenly, and they aren\u2019t boiled so long -- just a minute or two \u2014 that the nutrients are depleted. But lately I\u2019ve also been steaming chard, and I find this works well, too. I use the basket of my pasta pot, placing it above an inch of water in the pot. When making this easy pasta, be sure to cut the sweet bell peppers into very small dice; that way, they\u2019ll lodge in the hollows of the orecchiette, along with the chard and goat cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/29/business/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "healthy, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 48}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 405, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "579 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound Swiss chard 1 bunch, stemmed and washed in two changes of water", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "2 red bell peppers, cut in small dice", "Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)", "1 to 2 garlic cloves to taste, minced", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram", "3/4 pound orecchiette", "2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled 1/2 cup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Begin heating a large pot of water while you stem and wash the chard.
