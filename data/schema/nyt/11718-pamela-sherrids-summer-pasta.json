{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pamela Sherrid's Summer Pasta", "description": "Pamela Sherrid\u2019s summer pasta, which The Times ran a recipe for in 1996, is a quintessential crossover dish: part tomatoes and warm pasta, part pasta salad and the best of both. It includes ripe summer tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, basil and cubes of fresh mozzarella. Ms. Sherrid\u2019s recipe relies on prudent technique and a slacker\u2019s sense of pace. First you combine the garlic, basil and oil and let the mixture macerate. A few hours later you add tomatoes and let it sit some more. Next, you pour the cooked rigatoni over the tomatoes, and cubes of mozzarella over the rigatoni. Then you gently mix the cheese into the pasta, coating it with a buttery veil of fat, before tossing it with the tomatoes at the bottom. If you have great tomatoes and mozzarella and you don\u2019t overcook the pasta, it is a remarkably good dish. A puddle of sweet and salty tomato broth will form at the bottom of your bowl, so make sure you have some bread on hand to soak it up.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/22/dining/22COOKING-SHERRIDSUMMERPASTA1/22COOKING-SHERRIDSUMMERPASTA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, pastas, salads and dressings", "keywords": "mozzarella, pasta, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 338}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 large cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1/2 to 1 cup of your favorite olive oil", "12 basil leaves", "7 large ripe tomatoes", "Salt", "1 pound dried rigatoni", "1 pound fresh, lightly salted mozzarella", "Country bread"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Take out your largest bowl.
