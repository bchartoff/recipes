{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carnitas", "description": "Carnitas (or \u201clittle meats\u201d) are a traditional Mexican dish of cubed pork shoulder braised with spices and citrus until tender. Fresh orange, crushed garlic, earthy oregano and aromatic cinnamon and bay leaf create a rich and fragrant braising liquid that imparts its savory flavors into the pork as it cooks. There\u2019s very little hands-on work involved, and the carnitas can be made a day ahead. Store the pork in the liquid overnight, then gently reheat before serving. A final finish under the broiler creates a golden, crispy exterior on the meat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/17/dining/kc-carnitas/merlin_207907785_63e608b4-3c55-4aec-bf72-16723defea75-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, tacos, main course", "keywords": "orange, oregano, pork shoulder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 722}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch chunks", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more for seasoning", "1 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for seasoning\u00a0", "1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1 navel orange, quartered", "1 white onion, quartered", "7 garlic cloves, crushed", "1 cinnamon stick, broken into 2 pieces\u00a0", "1 bay leaf (dried or fresh)", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "Warmed tortillas, chopped white onion, chopped cilantro, sliced avocado and lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
