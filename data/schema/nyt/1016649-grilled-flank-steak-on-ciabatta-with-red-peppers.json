Just saut\u00e9 a tangle of onions and red peppers until tender, then hit it with a splash of red wine and black olive tapenade. Meanwhile, rub the meat with a little olive oil and paprika then grill (or broil) until done. Pile the sliced meat and pepper mixture onto toasted ciabatta and enjoy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/16/dining/16PAIR/16PAIR-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "steaks and chops", "keywords": "ciabatta bread, flank steak, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 76}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 410, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "515 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 13/4- to 2-pound flank steak", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "Salt and ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons black olive tapenade", "1/3 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1 large red onion, coarsely chopped", "4 cloves garlic, slivered", "2 large red bell peppers, cored and coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1 large ciabatta, halved horizontally"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Smear flank steak with 2 tablespoons olive oil, massage with paprika and season with salt and pepper.
