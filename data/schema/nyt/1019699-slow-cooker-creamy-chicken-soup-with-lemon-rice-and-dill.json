{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Creamy Chicken Soup With Lemon, Rice and Dill", "description": "This lightly creamy and incredibly comforting soup is all about the almost-austere interplay of chicken, broth, white rice and lemon. It's also a great way to use up leftover rice: Any variety will work. Tempering the yolks (slowly whisking hot broth into them) ensures that they will emulsify and thicken the soup, and not scramble. Use a half cup of lemon juice for an assertively tart soup, but, for a gentler effect, use the smaller amount. If you prefer, you can use an equivalent weight of chicken legs instead of thighs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/05/dining/sd-chicken-lemon-soup/sd-chicken-lemon-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 5 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken thighs, white rice, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 425}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 858, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "52 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "1711 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large yellow onion, peeled and quartered", "2 carrots, peeled, trimmed and halved", "2 celery stalks, halved", "5 large garlic cloves, peeled", "1 bay leaf", "3 1/2 to 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 8 thighs)", "6 cups chicken broth or stock", "Black pepper", "Kosher salt", "2 cups cooked white rice", "1/3 to 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 2 large lemons), more as needed", "4 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1 small bunch dill, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the onion, carrot, celery, garlic and bay leaf in a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker.

Coarsely shred the chicken meat and add it into the soup, discarding the bones and skin. Stir in the dill and taste the soup. Add salt if necessary, and more lemon juice and black pepper if you like.
