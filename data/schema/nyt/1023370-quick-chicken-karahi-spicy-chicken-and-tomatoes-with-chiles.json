{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quick Chicken Karahi (Spicy Chicken and Tomatoes With Chiles)", "description": "Chicken karahi is emblematic of Pakistani cooking, with its concentrated flavors that come from tomatoes simmered down to their sweet and tangy complexity. It is traditionally made in a karahi, a wide-mouthed, high-sided pan similar to a wok, which makes the cooking process quick and easy. (A deep 10- to 12-inch skillet works well, too.) Myriad spices \u2014 Kashmiri chile powder, cumin, coriander and turmeric \u2014 adds layers of heat. Finishing with plenty of thin matchsticks of ginger provides cooling freshness. Typically made with bone-in chicken pieces, this recipe calls for cubed boneless chicken thighs for a quicker cook time, so this classic dish can be enjoyed often.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zainab Shah"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/28/dining/zs-chicken-karahi/merlin_207647955_52cb3fc0-c6c7-467e-ab06-bb9d74cc3922-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "pakistani", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, red chili, thai chili, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 519}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup ghee or neutral oil", "3 dried whole round red chiles, preferably Dundicut (see Tip)", "1 teaspoon garlic paste or freshly grated garlic", "1 teaspoon ginger paste or freshly grated ginger", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch cubes", "5 Thai green chiles, 2 finely chopped and 3 slit down the middle with the root intact", "1 teaspoon Kashmiri chile powder", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "5 plum tomatoes, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 cup full-fat Greek yogurt", "1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice (from about half a lemon)", "1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon garam masala", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and julienned", "Roti or pita, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat ghee in a karahi, wok or high-sided 10- to 12-inch skillet over medium for 30 seconds.
