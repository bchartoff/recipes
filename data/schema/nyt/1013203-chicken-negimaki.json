{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Negimaki", "description": "The simplest way to keep white-meat chicken moist and make it flavorful is to put fat and flavor inside \u2014 to stuff it. Here is a chicken-cutlet take on negimaki, the Japanese dish of thinly sliced beef rolled around scallions. You need only briefly cook the scallions in soy sauce and mirin before wrapping some pounded-out chicken cutlets around them. Then baste the chicken with more sauce while it\u2019s cooking, either on the grill or in a broiler, so the salty-sweet glaze permeates the chicken from both inside and out. It takes a little time to pound and roll up chicken cutlets, but not nearly as much time as marinating, and the results are not only more functional but also far more interesting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/14/dining/14help/chicken-negimaki-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "chicken, soy sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 480}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 395, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1864 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup soy sauce", "1/2 cup mirin (or 1/4 cup honey mixed with 1/4 cup water)", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 bunch scallions, trimmed but left whole", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless white-meat chicken (breasts, cutlets or tenders), pounded to 1/8-inch thickness and blotted dry", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "Sesame oil as needed", "Lemon or lime wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put soy sauce, mirin, garlic and scallions in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.
