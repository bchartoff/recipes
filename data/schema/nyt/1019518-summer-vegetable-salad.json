{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Summer Vegetable Salad", "description": "This simple salad is seasoned with nothing more than salt, pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Made with fresh summer produce, it allows the vegetables\u2019 flavor and sweetness to shine through, needing little adornment. But you can also dress the salad with oil and vinegar and garnish with some meaty anchovy fillets, or use an anchovy vinaigrette (see note); these are just as delicious spooned over large spicy arugula leaves. Halved nine-minute eggs would be another nice accompaniment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/05/dining/05kitchenrex1/merlin_142336809_b04c6153-7f27-4348-b508-6e90c5a94a78-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, lunch, beans, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "cranberry beans, eggplant, romano beans, tomato, side dish, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 87}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 95, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "630 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups fresh coco, cranberry beans or other fresh shelling beans, from about 2 pounds in the pod", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 sprig thyme or rosemary, or 1 bay leaf", "1 pound Romano beans (sometimes called flat beans or runner beans), topped and tailed", "2 medium eggplants (about 1 pound), peeled, if desired", "1 1/2 pounds medium and cherry tomatoes, preferably of different colors, quartered, cut into wedges, or halved, as necessary", "Anchovy fillets or anchovy vinaigrette, optional (see note)", "Basil leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the shelling beans in a pot with water just to cover.
