{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Best Chicken Salad", "description": "The secret here isn\u2019t in the seasonings (though the tarragon and sour cream make it pretty wonderful) but in the texture of the chicken, described as \u201cplush\u201d by the chef Barbara Tropp in her \u201cChina Moon\u201d cookbook. She incorporated Chinese methods and flavors to her cooking, including this foolproof method for poaching chicken breasts without overcooking. It makes a chicken salad that\u2019s perfect for sandwiches (especially on dark rye or sourdough breads) or scooped onto a lettuce-lined plate with sliced radishes, tomatoes, crackers, grapes or all of the above.\n\nThe chicken breasts used here must be bone-in, but you can remove the skin if you prefer. The skin and bones flavor the cooking liquid, providing a bonus of several pints of chicken stock.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/13/dining/13RECIPE-LAB1-WEB/13RECIPE-LAB1-WEB-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "chicken breast, mayonnaise, sour cream, tarragon, walnut, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1383}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1112, "unsaturatedFatContent": "54 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "77 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "96 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1300 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts", "2 scallions, cut into thirds", "1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns", "1 lemon, halved", "2/3 cup mayonnaise, preferably Hellmann\u2019s, Best Foods or homemade", "1/4 cup sour cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard or 1 teaspoon brine from a jar of pickles, optional", "2 or 3 pale green celery ribs, cut into medium (1/4-inch) dice", "1/2 cup minced onion or finely sliced scallion, optional", "1/2 cup walnut or pecan halves, broken into bite-size pieces", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon, parsley, or chives, plus extra for garnish", "Salt and ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Choose a heavy pot or Dutch oven with a tightfitting lid.
