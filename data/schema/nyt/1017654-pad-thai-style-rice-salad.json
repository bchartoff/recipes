{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pad Thai-Style Rice Salad", "description": "My basic technique works like this: Cook the rice as you would pasta, in abundant salted water, tasting as you go; the cooking time will range from around 15 minutes for white rice to as long as 45 minutes for the most stubborn brown varieties (almost all will be done in 30 minutes or so). Drain and rinse; you want to get any remaining surface starch off so the salad isn\u2019t too clumpy. When the rice is cool enough to handle, dress it; it will absorb a bit of the dressing. Add herbs and garnishes just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "bean sprouts, chicken, jasmine rice, peanuts, shrimp, thai chile, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 40}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 117, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "644 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 cups white rice, preferably jasmine", "Salt", "5 tablespoons peanut or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn", "2 eggs, lightly beaten", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "1/4 pound shrimp, peeled and chopped", "1/4 pound chicken meat, chopped", "4 scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths", "1 cup bean sprouts, rinsed and trimmed, optional", "2 tablespoons fish sauce (nam pla), or more, if necessary", "1 tablespoon tamarind paste or ketchup", "2 teaspoons sugar, if you use tamarind", "1/4 cup lime juice, if you use ketchup", "2 chiles, preferably Thai, stemmed, seeded and sliced, optional", "1/4 cup chopped peanuts", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "1 lime, cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook rice in abundant salted water, as you would pasta, until it\u2019s just done; about 10 to 15 minutes.
