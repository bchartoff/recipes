{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Pie, Circus-Style", "description": "This winter in Paris, my husband went out every morning, walked to Circus bakery and returned home with an apple pie, a really good one. The rustic pie \u2014 a cross between an American open-face pie and a French galette \u2014 is made with a sturdy, rather wet dough. Chill the dough overnight and it will be a dream to work with. The filling is a generous mound of unpeeled, thinly sliced, lightly sweetened apples, flavored with an abundance of lemon juice and zest and, so surprisingly, not a speck of spice. At Circus, the palm-size pies are pentagonal. The dough is lifted up around the apples, pinched and pressed into shape. To learn to make the pastry at home, I watched Circus\u2019s bakers at work. I loved how each had a particular way of forming the pies. But, most of all, I loved that no matter how they shaped them, in the end, they all looked beautiful. My pie looks beautiful and yours will, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/08/magazine/08mag-eat/08mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "3 pies (6 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "apple, bread flour, demerara sugar, whole-wheat flour, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 405}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/340 grams bread flour", "1/3 cup/40 grams whole-wheat flour", "4 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/225 grams cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut into small chunks", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters ice water", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "5 teaspoons bread flour", "1 lemon, zested, then juiced", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "4 medium sweet apples (1 to 1 1/2 pounds; 450 to 680 grams), such as Golden Delicious, Fuji or Gala", "1 egg, for finishing", "Demerara or sanding sugar, for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Put the bread flour, whole-wheat flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor, and whir to combine.
