The sweet, buttery crunch of hazelnuts and the salty, rich blue cheese balance the bitter crisp of the radicchio. If you don't have hazelnuts, any toasted nut like almonds or walnuts will do. If you\u2019re not going meatless, crisp up a little pancetta before you add the radicchio or serve the pasta as a side to accompany roast chicken or pork.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/26/dining/ch-pasta-radicchio/ch-pasta-radicchio-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "fall, winter, gorgonzola, hazelnut, penne, radicchio, rigatoni, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 64}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 610, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "584 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 pound mezze rigatoni or penne rigate", "1 cup roughly chopped hazelnuts", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds radicchio, cored and cut into 1-inch ribbons (around 2 to 3 medium heads)", "Black pepper", "6 ounces crumbled Gorgonzola or other mild, soft blue cheese", "1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley", "Flaky salt, for serving (optional)", "Grated pecorino or Parmesan, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil.
