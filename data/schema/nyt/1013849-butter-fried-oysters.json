I won\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not a little bit of a project. There are bread crumbs to make, from a day-old French loaf. It\u2019s easy if you have a blender or food processor \u2014 just remove the crust and pulse the cubes into fluffy crumbs. My recipe also calls for clarified butter. It can be made ahead, it keeps, and it really makes a difference.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/butterfriedoysters/butterfriedoysters-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, bread, butter, oyster", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 81}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 775, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "sodiumContent": "823 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound unsalted butter", "1 large, day-old French loaf or other hearth-style white loaf", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "Salt", "pepper", "24 shucked oysters, drained", "3 eggs, lightly beaten", "Red-pepper mayonnaise, optional", "Lemon wedges, optional", "Watercress or arugula, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat, then raise the heat a little and cook at a bare simmer for about 10 minutes.

Serve hot with red-pepper mayonnaise, lemon wedges and arugula or watercress, if you like."}]}
