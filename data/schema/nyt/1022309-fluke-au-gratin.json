{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fluke au Gratin", "description": "This is a very old recipe, taken from the kitchen of Henri\u2019s in Lynbrook, N.Y., opened by an extravagant French restaurateur named Henri Charpentier in 1910. It asks for flounder, known on Long Island as fluke, but you could make it with cod or haddock or halibut, with freshwater trout or catfish, with any mild-flavored fish. It\u2019s an elegant and really quite simple preparation, the fish fillets baked on top of and beneath a butter sauce cooked with chopped shallots, garlic, chives, parsley and minced mushrooms, brightened with lemon juice and white wine, and with bread crumbs, sliced mushrooms and dots of butter strewn across the top. You can make the sauce in the morning, if you like, and assemble the dish for the oven just before dinner, making it a breeze for weeknight entertaining. But it\u2019s no stretch to do it all, as Charpentier might have said, \u201c\u00e0 la minute.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/20/magazine/20mag-eat/20mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, main course", "keywords": "bread crumbs, fish, fluke, mushroom", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 880}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing", "1 small shallot, peeled and minced", "1 garlic clove, peeled and minced", "2 tablespoons minced button mushrooms, plus 1/2 cup thinly sliced button mushrooms", "1 tablespoon minced chives", "1 tablespoon minced parsley, plus 1 tablespoon roughly chopped parsley for garnish", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white wine", "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon lemon juice", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 to 1 1/2 pounds fluke, flounder, sole or other mild, white-fleshed fish fillets", "1/3 cup dried bread crumbs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
