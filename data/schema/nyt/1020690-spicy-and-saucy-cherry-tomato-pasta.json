{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy and Saucy Cherry Tomato Pasta", "description": "In this incredibly easy weeknight pasta, red-pepper flakes, capers and tomato paste turn a simple cherry tomato sauce into something hearty enough for cold weather. Saut\u00e9eing tomato paste until it caramelizes develops deep flavor, while pan-fried capers add crunch and red-pepper flakes provide heat. For smokier undertones, you can use dried ancho chile or chile de arbol, chipotle powder or Aleppo pepper in place of the red-pepper flakes. A dollop of ricotta, freshly grated pecorino or Parmesan, or shaved ricotta salata is not necessary, but takes the dish up a notch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/dining/aw-cherry-tomato-pasta/aw-cherry-tomato-pasta-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "basil, capers, cherry tomatoes, garlic, pasta, red pepper flakes, tomato paste, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 399}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "3 tablespoons drained jarred capers", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 to 2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes (optional)", "16 ounces orecchiette or other shaped pasta", "1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes, halved", "1/2 packed cup thinly sliced fresh basil, plus small whole leaves, for garnish", "Fresh ricotta, shaved ricotta salata, or grated pecorino or Parmesan, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high.
