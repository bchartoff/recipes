Keep in mind that the redder your rhubarb, the rosier the shake. If you can only find green stalks, add a few strawberries to the pot to brighten things up. You can make the compote a week ahead, but don\u2019t blend the shake until just before serving. It will separate if left to sit out for more than ten minutes or so.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/14/multimedia/clark-rhubarb-shake/clark-rhubarb-shake-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "shakes and smoothies", "keywords": "rhubarb, rose water, yogurt, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 56}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound rhubarb, thinly sliced (2 cups)", "5 tablespoons honey, more to taste", "1 1/2 cups Greek yogurt", "2 cups ice cubes", "Rosewater, to taste", "Finely chopped pistachios, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir together rhubarb, honey and 2 tablespoons water in a medium saucepan.
