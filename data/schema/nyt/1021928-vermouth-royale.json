{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vermouth Royale", "description": "Bubbly, citrus-forward and refreshing, the Vermouth Royale is just as lovely served in the dead of winter as it is poolside during the summer.

Since cr\u00e8me de cassis can quickly skew a cocktail saccharine, the Vermouth Royale starts with a half-ounce. That said, if your preference for sweetness skews a touch higher, feel free to use up to three-quarters of an ounce of cr\u00e8me de cassis.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/24/dining/19Vermouthrex1-royale/19Vermouthrex1-royale-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 cocktail", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "christmas, new year\u2019s day, creme de cassis, lime, sparkling wine, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 70}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 lime, cut into wedges", "2 (3-inch) lemon peels", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Very small pinch of flaky sea salt", "2 ounces dry vermouth", "1/2 ounce cr\u00e8me de cassis", "Ice", "2 to 3 ounces sparkling wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the lime wedges, one of the lemon peels, sugar and salt to the bottom of a cocktail shaker.
