{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi and Potato Hash With Eggs", "description": "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016209-kimchi\">Kimchi</a> is punchy and potatoes are mellow, but together, they play off one another like the characters in an opposites-attract love story. Though universally adored for their comforting, creamy texture, potatoes often feel stodgy as the main ingredient of a meal, but pairing them with tangy, spicy kimchi lightens them up. Cut your potatoes into small cubes to ensure they don\u2019t take too long to cook. Hash just does not feel complete without eggs, which make this a handy one-pan meal. Finishing the dish with a drizzle of mayonnaise (preferably Kewpie, but other brands are fine, too) and a sprinkle of furikake lends a playful edge, or\u00a0you can make it even more fun to eat by wrapping up piles of the hash in nori, which adds a nice crunch and will remind you of a sushi roll.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/28/dining/hm-potato-and-kimchi-eggs/merlin_186367236_075e859c-236c-4702-998f-8b75001b281b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, weekday, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "eggs, kimchi, potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 769}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 red onion, thinly sliced", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 cup napa cabbage <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016209-kimchi\">kimchi</a>, undrained and roughly chopped", "2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "4 large eggs", "Mayonnaise, for garnish", "1 tablespoon furikake or toasted white sesame seeds, for serving", "1 scallion, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high.
