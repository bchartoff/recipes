{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Vietnamese Caramel Salmon", "description": "Searing salmon in a tangy lime and ginger caramel that\u2019s spiked with Asian fish sauce is one of my favorite ways to cook the fish. Usually I make this in a skillet, starting it on the stovetop and finishing it in the oven. But it cooks beautifully and very quickly in the pressure cooker, turning wonderfully tender. If you like your salmon slightly rare in the center, seek out thick center-cut fillets. They are less likely to overcook than are thinner pieces.\n\n\n<i>This is one of <a href=\"/68861692/7716592-melissa-clark-dinner-in-an-instant\">10 recipes</a> from Melissa Clark\u2019s \u201cDinner in an Instant: 75 Modern Recipes for Your Pressure Cooker, Multicooker, and Instant Pot\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2017).</i>\n\n<i>Melissa Clark\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562277/dinner-in-an-instant-by-melissa-clark/9781524762964/\">\u201cDinner in an Instant\u201d</a> is available everywhere books are sold. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Instant-Recipes-Pressure-Multicooker-ebook/dp/B06XK41BQV/?tag=NYTBks-20&ascsubtag=dinnerinstant\">Order your copy today.</a></i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/25/dining/vietnamesecaramelsalmon/vietnamesecaramelsalmon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, cookbook exclusive, seafood", "keywords": "fish sauce, lime, salmon, soy sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 634}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 529, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1512 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon coconut oil, melted, or 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/3 cup packed light brown sugar", "3 tablespoons Asian fish sauce", "1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger", "Finely grated zest of 1 lime", "Juice of 1/2 lime", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "4 skinless salmon fillets, preferably center-cut pieces, 6 to 8 ounces each", "Sliced scallions (white and green parts), for garnish", "Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using the saut\u00e9 function, whisk together the oil, brown sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, ginger, lime zest and juice, and black pepper in the pressure cooker.
