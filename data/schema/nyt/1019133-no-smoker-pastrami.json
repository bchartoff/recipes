{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "No-Smoker Pastrami", "description": "The lure of this pastrami recipe from La Bo\u00eete, a spice emporium in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, is that it is a project that does not require a smoker. The essential ingredients are smoked salt and Prague powder (the curing salt sodium nitrite). Both are sold online. It will take nearly a week to make, but the meat is mostly unattended. You could start it on Monday and have it ready for Sunday dinner. The pastrami \u2014 reheated and served with warm sauerkraut, or sliced on rye with mustard and sauerkraut \u2014 makes for superb cold-weather feasting. Keep it in mind as you plan for the Super Bowl or other occasions for feeding a crowd.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/10/dining/10pairingrex/merlin_131870720_fad473cc-fd39-4d14-bbdb-53f85c254dd5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P5DT14H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, project", "keywords": "brisket, Prague powder No. 1, smoked salt, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 28}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 555, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "454 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 4 to 5-pound piece of brisket, flat or point cut", "4 1/2 tablespoons smoked salt", "2/3 cup kosher salt", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 cup light brown sugar", "4 teaspoons Prague powder No. 1 (curing salt)", "2 bay leaves", "6 cloves garlic, smashed", "3 whole cloves", "1 tablespoon crushed black peppercorns", "1 teaspoon crushed allspice", "5 tablespoons crushed coriander seeds", "3 tablespoons black mustard seeds", "1/2 cup coarsely ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place brisket in a gallon-size zipper freezer bag and set aside in a bowl or a large plastic container.
