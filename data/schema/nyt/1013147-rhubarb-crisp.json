{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb Crisp", "description": "When you think of rhubarb you probably think of strawberry-rhubarb pie, a quintessential spring dessert, especially if it\u2019s made by someone who makes good pies. I usually manage around one pie crust annually, so I need alternatives. Thus, when the spring\u2019s first rhubarb shows up, I adjust the execution and produce a crisp. If rhubarb is young and fresh, you can trim it in seconds. If it has fibrous outer strings, peel them off as you would those of celery. Toss the rhubarb with orange or lemon juice and zest, and only a little sugar. (You can also substitute strawberries for some of the rhubarb if you want the classic combination.) Blend the ingredients for the crisp topping in a food processor, crumble the topping over the rhubarb mixture, and bake \u2014 it is nearly effortless and as good or better than a pie.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/20/dining/bittman-rhubarb-crisp-horizontal/merlin_137567802_d4758259-042a-4b7e-8122-e634664add6d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "dessert, rhubarb, rolled oats, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 962}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 276, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "48 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into small pieces, plus more for greasing pan", "2 1/2 to 3 pounds rhubarb, trimmed, tough strings removed, and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces (about 5 to 6 cups)", "1/4 cup white sugar", "1 tablespoon orange or lemon juice", "1 teaspoon orange or lemon zest", "3/4 cup brown sugar", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, or to taste", "Pinch salt", "1/2 cup rolled oats", "1/2 cup pecans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
