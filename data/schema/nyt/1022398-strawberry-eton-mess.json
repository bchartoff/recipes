{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Eton Mess", "description": "Eton mess is a classic British dessert made of a mixture of fresh fruit, cream and crushed baked meringue. It\u2019s deliciously simple and perfect for lazy summer days when berries are in season and the less time spent in the kitchen the better. Of course, you could make meringue cookies from scratch, but if you choose to buy them, there will be very little work to do. A little lime zest and juice gives this simple dessert an essential sweet-tart edge, though lemon would do the trick as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/27/dining/ss-eton-mess/merlin_191247180_d08fabad-906a-4165-ad0f-c48e87daf3e0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "heavy cream, lime, meringue, strawberries", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 454}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ounces vanilla meringue cookies", "1 1/2 pounds fresh strawberries", "2 teaspoons lime zest plus 1 tablespoon lime juice", "2 to 4 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 cups cold heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Transfer the meringue cookies to a large, resealable plastic bag.
