Store-bought rotisserie chicken and gnocchi live their best lives here, simmered in a comforting broth of chicken stock and heavy cream seasoned with rosemary and thyme. Leeks, carrots and celery are standard, but butternut squash, parsnips, mushrooms, fennel or shallots are worthy additions. Simply saut\u00e9 your aromatics and vegetables, simmer with some chicken stock and cream, stir in the chicken and gnocchi, and dinner is done in 20 minutes from start to finish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/30/dining/aw-quick-chicken-and-dumplings/merlin_166281663_9a0644d2-4d94-42f0-981c-87ab8c630d16-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "\u00a04 to 6 servings (about 9 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, poultry, soups and stews", "keywords": "carrot, celery, chicken, chicken stock, garlic, gnocchi, heavy cream, leek, rosemary, thyme, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 710}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 medium carrots or 8 ounces butternut squash, peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 cup)", "1 medium leek, trimmed, white and pale green portion halved lengthwise and thinly sliced (about 1 cup)", "2 medium celery\u00a0stalks, peeled and sliced 1/2-inch thick (about 2/3 cup)", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary", "2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves", "1 teaspoon poultry seasoning (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "5 cups chicken stock", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 (16-ounce) package fresh or shelf-stable store-bought gnocchi", "1/2 small (3-pound) store-bought rotisserie chicken, skin and bones discarded, meat torn into bite-size pieces (about 2 cups shredded meat)", "Fresh tarragon, parsley or dill, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, melt the butter over medium.
