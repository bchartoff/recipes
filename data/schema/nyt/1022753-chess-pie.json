{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chess Pie", "description": "With a sparkling bright lemon flavor, this classic Southern buttermilk chess pie filling is poured into a shortbread crust with hints of spice from freshly ground black pepper. The coarse cornmeal gives the beautiful custardy filling the slightest bit of texture once baked. Consider the baking time below as a guide: The pie is done when it jiggles slowly when moved back and forth. A sprinkling of confectioners\u2019 sugar is enough as a garnish to top the pie, and you\u2019d do well to serve each slice with a dollop of whipped heavy cream. It\u2019ll help temper the pie\u2019s vibrant sweetness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/12Komolafe1/merlin_197626089_f8df6e2b-b7a6-4ec1-aa70-45fe4cf50776-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H50M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "black pepper, buttermilk, lemon, pie, kwanzaa, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 838}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons/75 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch cubes, plus more for preparing the pan", "1 1/2 cups/205 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/63 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/4 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest", "2 egg yolks", "1/4 cup/58 milliliters cold water", "3 whole eggs", "3 egg yolks", "1 1/4 cups/260 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/40 grams medium-coarse yellow cornmeal", "1/4 cup/58 milliliters lemon juice", "1 tablespoon grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 cup/230 milliliters buttermilk, preferably full-fat", "1/4 cup/56 grams unsalted butter, melted", "Whipped heavy cream for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pie crust: Generously butter a 10-inch round, fluted tart pan.
