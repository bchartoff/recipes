{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Matzo Ball Soup With Celery and Dill", "description": "Greater than the sum of its parts, matzo ball soup is a wonderful combination of three very simple things: chicken broth (golden brown, deeply savory, lightly seasoned), matzo balls (tender, eggy, schmaltzy dumplings made with ground matzo) and garnish (celery and fresh dill, lots of it). The key to keeping the chicken juicy, tender and something you\u2019re excited to eat is by gently simmering the stock (which will also keep the broth crystal clear rather than muddied). You can pick the meat from the chicken and add it back to the soup if you like, or save for next-day chicken salad. For the matzo balls, matzo meal is preferred for its fine texture, but know that you can also grind your own from matzo boards in a food processor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/dining/30Romanrex1-matzo/30Romanrex1-matzo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "carrot, celery, chicken, dill, matzo meal, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 176}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (4- to 4 1/2-pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces, or 4 to 4 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts", "2 large yellow onions, unpeeled, quartered", "2 garlic heads, unpeeled, halved crosswise", "4 celery stalks, chopped", "2 large carrots, chopped", "Kosher salt", "1 cup matzo meal (not matzo ball mix), or 1 cup finely ground matzo boards", "1/4 cup finely chopped chives", "1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "5 large eggs", "1/3 cup chicken fat, grapeseed oil or unsalted butter, melted", "1/4 cup club soda or seltzer", "3 to 4 celery stalks, thinly sliced on a bias, plus any leaves", "1/2 cup chopped dill leaves", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the broth: Combine chicken, onions, garlic, celery and carrots in a large pot.
