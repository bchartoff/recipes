{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Breton Tuna and White Bean Gratin", "description": "Like a tuna casserole given a makeover, this pantry dinner is modern, sleek and a whole lot more elegant than anything your grandmother used to serve. The key is using really good-quality tuna, preferably the kind packed in extra-virgin olive oil and imported from Italy or Spain. If you can find a large 7-ounce can, use that. But the more typical size (5 3/4 ounces) will work perfectly well if you can\u2019t. Serve this over toasted slices of crusty bread that you\u2019ve drizzled with oil. A crisp green salad or platter of sliced, salted cucumber is all you need to make a satisfying meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28DIANA-HENRY8-WEB/28DIANA-HENRY8-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "gruy\u00e8re, heavy cream, panko, tuna, white beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 406}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 444, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "718 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 onion, finely chopped", "6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 (14-ounce) cans white beans", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Black pepper, to taste", "2 tablespoons heavy cream (or use more milk if you don\u2019t have cream)", "2 tablespoons whole milk", "1 can tuna in olive oil (preferably a 7-ounce can, but 5 3/4-ounce is fine)", "1 small dried red chile, crumbled (optional)", "1/4 cup grated Gruy\u00e8re\u00a0", "2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "1/2 tablespoon chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
