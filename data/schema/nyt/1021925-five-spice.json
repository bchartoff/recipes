This one, adapted from Kian Lam Kho, the author of <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/223000/phoenix-claws-and-jade-trees-by-kian-lam-kho-photographs-by-jody-horton/\">\u201cPhoenix Claws and Jade Trees: Essential Techniques of Authentic Chinese Cooking\u201d</a> (Clarkson Potter, 2015), includes Sichuan peppercorns to give the mix a characteristically numbing, tingly sensation on the tongue known as mala. Once the spices are toasted and mixed, the blend can be used both whole (simmered into stews, braises and soups) and ground (added to sauces, roasted meats and vegetables). Or, stir some salt into the ground blend and use it as a piquant table condiment: It\u2019s wonderful sprinkled on everything from barbecued meats to scrambled eggs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/24/dining/22Spicesrex4-five-spice/merlin_183521457_366611fa-7bbd-4d1c-b48a-41d02477acdf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1/4 cup ground spice blend", "recipeCuisine": "asian, chinese", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "cassia bark, clove, fennel, sichuan peppercorns, star anise", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 66}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (2-inch/5-gram) piece cassia bark\u00a0or cinnamon stick, broken into pieces", "1 1/2 teaspoons/5 grams fennel seeds", "5 whole star anise pods\u00a0(5 grams)", "3 1/2 teaspoons/5 grams Sichuan peppercorns\u00a0", "2 teaspoons/5 grams whole cloves\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a small skillet over medium heat.
