{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Zucchini Loaf Cake", "description": "This simple, one-bowl loaf cake is a sweet way to make the most of zucchini season. Chocolate cake batter is flecked with shreds of raw zucchini and studded with bittersweet chocolate chips for a summertime cake that\u2019s fit for either breakfast or dessert. While some recipes call for squeezing the excess water out of the shredded zucchini, this loaf cake takes full advantage of the summer vegetable: The zucchini is taken directly from the grater to the bowl for additional moisture. The resulting cake strikes the perfect balance; it's rich and fudgy, but still maintains a tender crumb. The cake will keep on the counter for 4 to 5 days, loosely covered, and only gets better with age.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jesse Szewczyk"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/02/dining/JS-Chocolate-Zucchini-Loaf-Cake/merlin_210914070_9e5abaca-8537-4d3a-9dc4-8bbe2e9ab704-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "1 loaf (about 8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick breads, dessert", "keywords": "chocolate, loaf cake, make-ahead, one bowl, zucchini, fourth of july, labor day, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1575}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray or neutral oil", "2 large eggs", "1 1/2 cups/330 grams packed light brown sugar", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters neutral oil (such as vegetable or safflower)", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "2 cups/280 grams lightly packed coarsely grated zucchini (from about 1 large or 2 small zucchini)", "1 3/4 cups/223 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/63 grams unsweetened natural cocoa powder", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup/173 grams bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips", "1 tablespoon coarse sugar (such as turbinado or Demerara)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
