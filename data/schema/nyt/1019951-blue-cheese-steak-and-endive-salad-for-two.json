{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blue-Cheese Steak and Endive Salad for Two", "description": "Why fuss with reservations when you can have your own bistro night at home? Hanger steaks are readily available, quick cooking and full of flavor. In this recipe, the steaks are seared, then slathered in blue cheese butter and served alongside an endive and radish salad dressed in a citrus vinaigrette, a perfect complement to the rich steak. This very special dinner comes together in about 30 minutes. If you'd like, toss baby potatoes with a little olive oil, salt and pepper and pop them into the oven to roast while you prepare the steak and salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/dining/ch-hanger-steak/ch-hanger-steak-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops, vegetables", "keywords": "blue cheese, chives, endive, fennel, parsley, radish, steak, tarragon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 173}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 816, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "69 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "45 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "sodiumContent": "884 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter, slightly softened", "2 tablespoons good-quality blue cheese, such as Roquefort, Stilton or Gorgonzola", "1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot", "3/4 to 1 pound hanger or skirt steak, at room temperature", "Kosher salt and\u00a0black pepper", "1 tablespoon canola or grapeseed oil", "Flaky salt (optional)", "2 Belgian endives, leaves separated", "4 to 5 thinly sliced radishes, a variety of colors if you can find them", "1/2 small fennel bulb, cored and thinly sliced (about 1/3 cup)", "2 tablespoons good quality white-wine vinegar", "1/4 teaspoon orange zest", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon olive oil", "1/4 cup Italian parsley leaves, torn", "1 tablespoon chives, cut on an angle into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped tarragon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, stir together butter, blue cheese and shallot, and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season steaks well with salt and pepper on both sides and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, assemble your salad: In a large bowl, gently toss together the endive leaves, radishes and fennel.
