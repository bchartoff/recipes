{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chile Verde Guacamole", "description": "Mexicans are split into two camps when it comes to guacamole: those who always add lime juice and those who absolutely do not. Many Sonoran friends shout \u201cNever!\u201d at the mere suggestion. Having grown up in the pro-lime camp in Mexico City, I was filled with skepticism before trying versions from the deep Mexican north, but what a pleasant surprise. The creamy and nutty avocado takes a deserving central role in Sonoran guacamoles. What won me over was the combination of two chiles: roasted Anaheim, with its tart, fresh, peppery flavors, and raw serrano, with its grassy taste and heat. (I hate to admit it, but this guacamole really needs no lime.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10carneasadarex5-guac/merlin_175269093_ad01b566-c3bf-4a46-aaa9-6bf9082264b3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 3 cups (4 to 6 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, snack, condiments, dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "anaheim chiles, avocado, cilantro, serrano chili, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 219}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 fresh Anaheim chile", "1 serrano chile, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons finely chopped white onion", "2 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, plus more to taste", "3 ripe avocados, halved and pitted, meat diced and mashed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the Anaheim chile on a small baking sheet covered with aluminum foil.
