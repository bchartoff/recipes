Similar pilaf-style rice dishes are made all across the Middle East and into Asia. Kabuli pulao in Afghanistan is acclaimed; the Persian baghali polov ba gusht is justly famous, as is the Lebanese Hashwet al-ruz; and there are myriad fabled biryanis made with lamb (or goat) in India and Pakistan. Pomegranate molasses is available in Middle Eastern groceries or online. It provides a sweet-sour, fruity undertone, but you may omit it and still get good results. Try a squeeze of lime instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/25/dining/25KITCHEN1/25KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, casseroles, meat, one pot", "keywords": "boneless lamb shoulder, dried chickpeas, golden raisins, walnut, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 219}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 846, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "75 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "692 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight, or 3 cups cooked or canned chickpeas", "2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut in 1-inch cubes", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large onion, diced", "1/2 cup golden raisins", "2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses, optional", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon ground mace or nutmeg", "1 cinnamon stick, 2 inches long", "1 1/2 cups basmati rice, soaked for 20 minutes and rinsed", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 cup walnut halves and pieces", "1/2 cup fresh pomegranate seeds", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped mint", "Pinch of crushed red pepper", "Thick plain yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using dried chickpeas: Put soaked chickpeas in a saucepan and cover with water by 1 inch.
