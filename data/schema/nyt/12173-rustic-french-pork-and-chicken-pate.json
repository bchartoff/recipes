{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rustic French Pork and Chicken Pate", "description": "O.K., this is a little bit of a project, but not too taxing for an adventurous home cook. How about making your own p\u00e2t\u00e9 for the holidays? Ask the butcher to grind three-fourths of the meat medium, and one-fourth very coarse. Otherwise, if you are using a home meat grinder, you will need to hand chop about one-fourth of the meat, so that the mixture is dotted with little cubes of meat and fat. This will ensure a juicy texture and a rough mosaic pattern in each slice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/14/dining/14KITCH/14KITCH-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken, pork", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 51}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 308, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "301 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 pounds boneless pork shoulder, not too lean", "3/4 pound boneless chicken thighs", "3 ounces pancetta or unsmoked bacon, sliced thick", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated garlic", "1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh sage", "1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "1 tablespoon Cognac or other brandy", "1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns", "1/4 teaspoon coriander seeds", "1/8 teaspoon fennel seeds", "4 cloves", "Pinch freshly grated nutmeg", "Pinch cinnamon", "Pinch cayenne", "1 bay leaf"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make sure the meat is quite cold, then cut it in 1-inch strips.
