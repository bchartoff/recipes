{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Noodles With Garlicky Cashew Sauce", "description": "This dish is loosely based on an Indo-Chinese garlic noodle dish. Here, a combination of Italian and Chinese condiments like cashews, Parmesan, soy sauce and anchovies create a creamy, umami-rich garlic sauce. This recipe uses rice noodles, but you could use egg noodles, ramen or any type of noodle. Since Parmesan, anchovies and soy sauce tend to fall on the saltier side, taste as you go and season the sauce accordingly. Feel free to reduce the amount of garlic, as it leans toward the generous side. These noodles are best eaten warm as soon as they\u2019re mixed with the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/31/dining/ns-garlic-noodles/ns-garlic-noodles-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, noodles, pastas, main course", "keywords": "cashew, parmesan, rice noodles, sesame oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 663}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup raw cashews", "8 ounces stir-fry rice noodles", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil, plus more for finishing, if desired", "1/4 packed cup grated Parmesan", "4 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1 tablespoon anchovy paste", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "Fine sea salt", "2 scallions, thinly sliced (about 1/4 cup)", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the cashews in 2 cups of boiling water for 15 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start the noodles: As cashews soak, prepare the noodles according to package directions.
