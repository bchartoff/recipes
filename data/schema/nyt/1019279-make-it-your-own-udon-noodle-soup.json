{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Make-It-Your-Own Udon Noodle Soup", "description": "This incredibly easy soup, which was developed for a special kids edition of The Times, is just the thing to warm you from fingertips to toes on a chilly day. It starts with a simple garlic-ginger broth, to which you add pretty much any vegetable, tofu or cooked meat that you like (meatballs are fun). Just be sure to slice any firm vegetables thinly, so they can cook quickly. Toss a tangle of cooked noodles in to the broth, and add a frenzy of toppings \u2013 halved hard-boiled eggs, roasted peanuts, sliced scallions, sprouts, nori (a type of seaweed), a drizzle of sriracha \u2013 whatever excites you. As for noodles, we like udon, because they're delightfully soft and chewy, but you can also use spaghetti, bucatini or even ramen. (Fun fact: Udon dough is traditionally kneaded with your feet.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/14/magazine/udon-noodle-soup2/udon-noodle-soup2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, lunch, quick, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 117}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 351, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "568 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ounces dried udon (2/3 of an 8-ounce package) or 2 7-ounce packages fresh or frozen noodles (spaghetti or bucatini also work)", "1 teaspoon sesame, olive, vegetable or canola oil", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Fresh ginger, about 1-inch, peeled and finely minced, or grated on the smallest holes of a box grater", "2 to 4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced, or grated on the smallest holes of a box grater", "3 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth", "2 cups, total, fresh or frozen vegetables, like thinly sliced carrots, bok choy, mushrooms, snow or snap peas, green beans, baby corn, corn kernels, peas, edamame, fresh spinach", "1/2 cup cubed firm tofu, precooked chicken, pork or beef (optional)", "1 tablespoon white miso paste or 3 to 4 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more soy sauce as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare noodles according to package directions, and drain.
