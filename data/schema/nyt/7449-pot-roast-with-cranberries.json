{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pot Roast With Cranberries", "description": "There's more to the cranberry than sauce, you know, and this simple roast is happy, yet unexpected, proof. Its preparation is as simple as can be: generously dust the meat with sugar then sear in a skillet. Once browned, toss in a bag of cranberries, orange peel, orange juice, a good half cup of sherry vinegar and a pinch of cayenne. Cover and simmer until tender. It's a lively, perfectly-balanced, cold-weather meal. It also makes a mercifully easy Christmas main.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/19/dining/19POTROAST/19POTROAST-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "\u00a04 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beef, tenderloin, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 145}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon butter or extra-virgin olive oil\u00a0", "1/2 cup sugar\u00a0", "1 2-pound piece beef tenderloin, or 3-pound piece chuck or brisket\u00a0", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper\u00a0", "1/2 cup sherry vinegar or good wine vinegar\u00a0", "1 12-ounce bag cranberries\u00a0", "1 orange\u00a0", "Cayenne, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put butter or oil in a casserole or skillet with a lid, and turn heat to medium-high.
