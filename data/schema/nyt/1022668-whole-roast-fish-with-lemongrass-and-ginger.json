{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Roast Fish With Lemongrass and Ginger", "description": "A marinade packed with aromatics, like lemongrass, ginger, shallots and scotch bonnet chile, is crushed in a mortar and pestle and spread onto a mild white fish, such as a whole branzino, in this recipe. As with most marinades, the longer you let it steep, the better. Using the mortar and pestle is optional, but a highly rewarding process \u2014 and encouraged. If you have an asanka, the grooved surface will give the marinade a unique texture, with bouquets rising from the bowl as you work. Serve the roast fish flaked off the bone, over rice or alongside a fresh green salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/27/dining/22Komolaferex/merlin_196519761_a7942458-6e28-4a66-8df2-6bc9ba07f4e6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "fish, ginger, lemongrass, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 201}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds whole fish, scaled and cleaned (about 3 whole branzino)", "6 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola oil\u00a0", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 stalk lemongrass (about 2 1/4 ounces), tough outer part discarded, chopped", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger, scrubbed and chopped", "4 scallions, green parts sliced and white parts trimmed and left whole", "1 scotch bonnet chile, with or without seeds, chopped", "1 shallot, peeled and chopped", "2 lemons\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 cup full-fat coconut milk", "10 cilantro sprigs, cut crosswise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
