{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beet Red Velvet Cake", "description": "Pamela Moxley, the pastry chef at Miller Union in Atlanta, developed this cake as part of a book project for Steven Satterfield, the co-owner and chef. She uses dutched, nonacidic cocoa powder so she punched up the acid with extra lemon juice, which helps with the bright red color. She adds goat cheese to her cream cheese frosting, to play against the subtle beet flavor. The chef liked it so much that he added it to the restaurant menu.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/14/dining/14REDVELVET1/14REDVELVET1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beet, cake, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 249}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 376, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "326 milligrams", "sugarContent": "38 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 medium beets", "3/4 cup/ 170 grams butter, plus more for greasing pan", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters buttermilk", "Juice of 1 large lemon", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters white vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons/7 milliliters vanilla extract", "2 cups/200 grams cake flour (sift before measuring)", "3 tablespoons/24 grams Dutch process cocoa powder", "1 1/8 teaspoon/6 grams baking powder", "1 teaspoon/6 grams salt", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams baking soda", "1 3/4 cup/350 grams granulated sugar", "3 eggs", "Cream cheese frosting (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1016331/cream-cheese-frosting.html\">see recipe</a>), or other fluffy white icing "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
