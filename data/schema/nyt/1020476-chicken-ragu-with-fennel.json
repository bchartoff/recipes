{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Rag\u00f9 With Fennel", "description": "This is a simplified riff on a popular recipe that the food editor Andy Baraghani developed for Bon App\u00e9tit magazine. It\u2019s a velvety rag\u00f9 that relies on chicken thighs, bacon and onions for flavor. It takes a couple of steps \u2014 browning the chicken, letting it cool after it braises and then shredding it \u2014 but it is not too challenging for a weeknight. The recipe is versatile. Over egg noodles, it serves six for dinner, but it can also make a nice dinner for two or four. The leftovers freeze well, or can turn into a filling for hand pies, which are terrific tucked into lunchboxes the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/23lunchrex1/merlin_160763217_e6d0be5a-8dec-4af8-9150-208889ef2d29-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "bacon, chicken thighs, fennel, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 305}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "6 ounces bacon, thinly sliced crosswise", "6 bone-in chicken thighs (about 1 3/4 pounds)", "Kosher salt", "1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)", "1 bulb fennel, cored and finely chopped", "6 sprigs fresh thyme", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "Pasta (optional)", "1/2 cup whole milk", "Ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the oil in a wide saucepan or deep skillet that will fit six thighs snugly and turn the heat to medium.
