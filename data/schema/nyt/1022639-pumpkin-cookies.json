{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Cookies", "description": "More like portable cakes, these spiced pumpkin cookies are delightfully tender and moist, simple, and absolutely divine with a cup of coffee. Eat them just as they are, or give them a dusting of powdered sugar or more ground cinnamon, a drizzle of a confectioners\u2019 sugar glaze, or maybe a swipe of cream-cheese frosting. These little guys could even work as the top and bottom of the perfect pumpkin whoopie pie. Because these cookies are so moist, it\u2019s best to store them layered between parchment or wax paper in an airtight container at room temperature. You could also freeze them and thaw before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/14/dining/ss-pumpkin-cookies/ss-pumpkin-cookies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 1/2 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, dessert", "keywords": "cookie, freezer friendly, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1758}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/192 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons ground ginger", "1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 cup/220 grams packed light or dark brown sugar", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/167 grams pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Sanding sugar, for sprinkling (optional)\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
