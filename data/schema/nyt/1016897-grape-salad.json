{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grape Salad", "description": "This grape salad, which falls into the same category of old-fashioned party dishes as molded Jell-O salad, comes from a Minnesota-born heiress, who tells me it was always part of the holiday buffet in her family. It couldn\u2019t be simpler to prepare and has only three ingredients: grapes, sour cream and brown sugar. \nRather like a creamy fruit salad with a crisp sugar topping, it really is delicious, though the concept sounded strange to me before I first tasted it. Other versions, I hear, call for softened cream cheese and nondairy \u201cwhipped topping\u201d; I can\u2019t say I\u2019ll be trying that. Some cooks caramelize the brown sugar under the broiler and some don\u2019t, but I definitely recommend this step, which gives the dish a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e aura.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19MINNESOTA/19MINNESOTA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "grapes, pecans, sour cream, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 91}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 258, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "34 milligrams", "sugarContent": "37 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds seedless grapes, removed from stems and rinsed, about 6 cups", "2 cups sour cream", "1 cup brown sugar", "3/4 cup toasted pecans (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat broiler.
