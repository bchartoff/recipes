{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Winter Squash Casserole With Rosemary", "description": "A pungent bath of minced garlic and rosemary gives a squash casserole new life, and in turn, this casserole gives new life to your fall and winter tables. It comes from Sarah Leah Chase, a cook on Nantucket, Mass., whose book \"Cold-Weather Cooking\" is full of good things for the winter holidays. Flouring the squash cubes helps them form a crust, and prevents the casserole from becoming mushy; the whiff of ginger in the coating is barely detectable but adds freshness. Slow-baking the squash turns it tender and sweet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/26/dining/26COOKING_SQUASHCASS1/26COOKING_SQUASHCASS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, winter, rosemary, squash, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 548}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 187, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "299 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium-size winter squash (such as butternut, delicata, Hubbard or a combination) peeled, seeded and cubed (about 8 cups cubes)", "\u00bc cup all-purpose flour \u00a0", "1/8 teaspoon cornstarch", "2 teaspoons ground ginger", "1 teaspoon salt, more to taste", "\u00bd teaspoon black pepper, more to taste", "4 to 6 garlic cloves, minced", "\u00bd cup finely chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary", "1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
