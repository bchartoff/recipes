They are the precious stars of her holiday cookie plate. The dough can be slightly finicky but can be re-rolled and re-chilled several times so all the scraps get used. The ideal thickness is somewhere between an eighth and a fourth of an inch. They need to be thin but not so thin that the delicate cookie breaks. The roasted almonds can be ground in a food processor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/03/dining/03COOKFIGHT1/03COOKFIGHT1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 30 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "almonds, raspberry jam, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 182}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 159, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "31 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cup unsalted butter (2 1/2 sticks), softened", "2/3 cup/145 grams sugar", "2 1/3 cups/308 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/70 grams finely ground, roasted almonds", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/8 ounces good-quality raspberry jam, preferably seedless", "Powdered sugar for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
