{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Flourless Chocolate Cake", "description": "Crackly on top and fudgy yet tender in the center, this cake tastes like a complex restaurant dessert, but comes together effortlessly in one bowl. Chocolate chips save you the messy step of chopping chocolate bars and deliver deep flavor along with cocoa powder. If you don\u2019t have a springform pan, a regular cake pan lined with foil all around makes it easy to lift out the delicate cake, which melts in your mouth when served warm or at room temperature. Refrigerated or frozen leftovers take on a candylike chewiness, but a quick zap in the microwave will return it to just-baked softness. Slices are delicious on their own or with any creamy toppings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/16/dining/11korex-chocolate/merlin_200212497_081f3ab6-1907-4e1c-aee9-6027e118b9db-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, dessert", "keywords": "chocolate cake, chocolate chips, cocoa powder, make-ahead, one bowl, gluten-free, mother\u2019s day, valentine\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1723}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/168 grams unsalted butter, cut up, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 cup/173 grams bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips", "1/2 cup/50 grams unsweetened natural cocoa powder", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "Whipped cream or ice cream, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
