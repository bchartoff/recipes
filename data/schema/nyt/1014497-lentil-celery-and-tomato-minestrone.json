The celery, which may be lingering in the fridge having played a minor part in another recipe, adds a dimension of flavor to the mix that ordinary minestrone just doesn\u2019t have. Celery has long been used in Chinese medicine to help control high blood pressure. It is also an excellent source of Vitamins K and C, and a very good source of potassium, folate, dietary fiber, molybdenum, manganese, and Vitamin B6.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/22/science/21recipehealth/21recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 90}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1077 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup lentils, rinsed", "1 onion, halved", "A bouquet garni made with 2 sprigs each thyme and parsley, a bay leaf, and a Parmesan rind", "1 1/2 quarts water", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium carrot, diced", "3 celery stalks, diced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste", "1 28-ounce can chopped tomatoes, with liquid", "Pinch of sugar", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "Very thinly sliced celery, from the inner heart, for garnish", "Freshly grated Parmesan cheese for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the lentils, 1/2 onion and the bouquet garni with 1 quart water in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
