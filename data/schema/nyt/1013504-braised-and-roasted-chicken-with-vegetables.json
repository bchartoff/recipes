{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised and Roasted Chicken With Vegetables", "description": "The idea behind this recipe was to create a contemporary American chicken dinner. The result is a whole-bird meal that takes a bit more time and effort than a simple roast chicken but offers an outcome that is just short of mind-blowing, with a variety of tastes and textures the classic cannot touch. You can make this dish with chicken parts and water or canned stock, but it\u2019s more efficient \u2014 and far tastier \u2014 to begin with a three-to-four-pound chicken and go through the whole process. Stay away from the water-pumped monsters, please; the point is to find a bird that tastes like something. The dish will serve at least four people \u2014 six, if you add a couple of sides.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/dining/braised/braised-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday", "keywords": "chicken, vegetables, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 119}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 629, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1264 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons chicken fat, reserved from the chicken-skin croutons or use olive oil or butter", "2 skinless chicken leg-thigh quarters", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "1 skin-on chicken breast, split to yield 2 halves", "3 leeks, trimmed, cleaned and chopped", "4 carrots, chopped", "6 celery ribs, chopped, leaves reserved for garnish", "12 to 16 ounces cremini, shiitake, button or other fresh mushrooms, quartered or sliced", "3 to 4 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary", "Chicken-wing meat", "The quick chicken stock"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350.
