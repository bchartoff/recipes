{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Borscht", "description": "This white borscht, a nod to the tradition of sour soups in Ukrainian cooking, is simply a perfect\u00a0meal: rich and satisfying, yet bright and delicate and clean all at once. It\u2019s given its distinct tang up front, by soaking a hunk of sourdough bread in the simmering broth, and also at the end, by whisking in a little cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche before serving. At the\u00a0center is the delicious, subtle, complex broth. The\u00a0better the kielbasa, the better the broth, obviously, and it\u2019s worth using the whole garland for that complex smoky seasoning it imparts. There\u2019ll be extra for snacking. The chopped dill keeps it all bright and fresh and lively in the mouth. A year-round classic to have in your repertoire, it\u2019s especially beloved in colder months. When weather forecasters announce a dismal spell of sleeting days in a row, you\u2019ll think, oh, good!
