{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Marbled Shortbread With Ginger and Turmeric", "description": "This cookie combines ground ginger and turmeric with roasted cashews and white chocolate. A simple shortbread dough, made with a larger ratio of butter to sugar, allows the complex flavors to shine. Shaping the dough into a rectangular block and cutting it into logs keeps things compact in the freezer while also allowing for easy and even slicing and baking. Thanks to the spices and aromatics, the cookies even get a little better with age. Don't worry about getting your swirls perfect. No matter how you do it, these cookies will be as beautiful as they are delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Laurie Ellen Pellicano"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/05/dining/lep-marbled-shortbread/merlin_184806285_f6ebe641-81a5-4ccb-9dc8-59894977ff37-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 90 small cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "cashew, flour, ginger, turmeric, white chocolate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/3 cups/425 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar (no need to sift)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 packed teaspoon orange zest (from about 1 orange)", "1 large egg", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger", "1 cup/120 grams toasted salted cashews, lightly crushed with a rolling pin", "4 ounces/115 grams good-quality white chocolate, roughly chopped (about 3/4 cup from a bar, block or f\u00e8ves)", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh orange juice or vanilla extract", "1 tablespoon ground turmeric"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, ground ginger and baking powder."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with a hand mixer, beat together butter, sugar, salt and orange zest until lightened and fluffy, about 3 minutes, using a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, crack the egg and whisk to lightly break up the yolk.
