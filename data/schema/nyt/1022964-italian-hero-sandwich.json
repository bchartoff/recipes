{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Italian Hero Sandwich", "description": "Italian hero, sub, hoagie, grinder \u2014 this classic sandwich has many names, and every deli makes it differently. Its deliciousness lies in the proportion of rich-and-fatty ingredients to spicy-and-crunchy ones. For optimal structure and texture, start with crusty rolls with pillowy insides (or toast soft rolls). Use two to four types of cured meat for a range of umami, and plenty of lettuce and pickles to counterbalance them. Then assemble wisely: Shingle the meat and cheese across the rolls, then top with pickles, onions and dressed lettuce. Once put together, the wet ingredients are wrapped in meat so they\u2019re held in place and the bread doesn\u2019t get soggy. Wrap with parchment or wax paper for tidier eating and transporting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/07/dining/as-italian-sub/merlin_201238275_040c2bf1-9f7d-4653-9f83-9b262dd03a05-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "iceberg lettuce, prosciutto, provolone, salami", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 245}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small red onion, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "4 (6- to 8-inch-long) sub, hero or hoagie rolls, split lengthwise but attached on one side", "Mustard and/or mayonnaise (optional)", "4 ounces sliced provolone and/or low-moisture mozzarella cheese", "1 pound thinly sliced Italian cured meats, such as salami, prosciutto, mortadella, coppa and/or soppressata", "1 cup sliced pickled peppers, such as pepperoncini, banana peppers, giardiniera and/or jalape\u00f1os", "1 small head iceberg lettuce (about 1 pound), thinly sliced\u00a0", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the red onion under cold water, then transfer to a large bowl.
