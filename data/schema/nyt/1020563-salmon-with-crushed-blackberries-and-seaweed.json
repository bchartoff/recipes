{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon With Crushed Blackberries and Seaweed", "description": "A traditional staple on the Pacific Northwest coast, salmon is considered a sacred food. This dish is often slow-roasted on cedar or redwood spikes near an open fire, giving the fish a beautiful smoky flavor. In the kitchen, searing the salmon in a skillet allows the true flavor of wild-caught fish to shine through. Seaweed harvesting goes back countless generations, and so the salty seaweed is a great accompaniment here, along with the sweet local blackberries, a combination that is natural for the Muckleshoot and other tribes of the region.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sean Sherman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/06/dining/04NativeAmericanrex7/04NativeAmericanrex7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, seafood", "keywords": "blackberries, chives, salmon fillet, wakame seaweed, main course, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 37}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups fresh blackberries", "Coarse sea salt", "4 (5- to 6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, preferably wild-caught sockeye salmon", "3 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus more as needed", "2 to 3 tablespoons dried wakame seaweed", "Fresh chive stems, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, crush half the blackberries using the back of a fork.
