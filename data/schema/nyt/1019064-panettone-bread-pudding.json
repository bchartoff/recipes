{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Panettone Bread Pudding", "description": "If you\u2019ve bought a loaf of truly fantastic panettone, made in the Italian tradition from a natural starter, the kind that\u2019s airy and melting, we hope you don\u2019t have any leftovers. But if you find yourself with an excess of mass-produced panettone, or simply very old panettone that\u2019s past its prime, here\u2019s how to  transform it into something special. Cut it into thick slices, as the pastry chef Elisabeth Prueitt does with brioche, when she makes her bread pudding at Tartine Bakery in San Francisco. Toast them. Now layer the bread in a wide dish, and pour over a whisked custard of milk and eggs. It will look like too much liquid, but as it bakes, the panettone will soak it all up, becoming moist and tender and impossibly rich. It\u2019s close enough to a casserole of French toast to make it ideal for a special holiday breakfast, but sweet enough to step in as dessert on a cold night. Vanilla would be a classic way to flavor the custard, but panettone tends to be quite sweet and perfumed already, so taste the bread first before adding extras.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/dining/29PANETTONE/29PANETTONE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, custards and puddings", "keywords": "dessert, fall, winter, panettone", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 89}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 418, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "373 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "6 to 8 slices/550 grams panettone", "6 eggs", "1/3 cup/67 grams sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 cups whole milk", "Confectioners' sugar, to garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees and butter a deep baking dish that will fit all the bread slices in a single layer, overlapping slightly, about 9 by 5 inches.
