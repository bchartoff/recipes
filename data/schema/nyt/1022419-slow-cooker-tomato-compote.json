{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Tomato Compote", "description": "This savory compote \u2014 a typically sweet, slow-simmered fruit preserve \u2014 is a delicious way to eat cherry tomatoes, especially those that are on the verge of being too soft. But it\u2019s also a great way to intensify the flavor of middling supermarket cherry tomatoes in the winter. Either way, the sweet-tart tomatoes can build super-quick meals: Put them on top of ricotta or avocado toast, or squish them into a grilled cheese. Toss them with hot or cold pasta. Use the oil and juices in salad dressings and the tomatoes in the salad itself. The compote can be used right away, but it\u2019s best the next day and will keep in the fridge for at least a week. Feel free to throw in any hardy, woody herbs you like, but don\u2019t add very delicate herbs like basil, chives or dill before cooking. You can add a handful of those softer herbs before serving, if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/19/dining/tomato-compote/merlin_190126737_5204d63e-5107-4a98-91cb-6f700487c744-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H10M", "recipeYield": "About 3 \u00bd cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "slow cooker, tomato, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 900}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds cherry or grape tomatoes (about 4 pints)", "4 garlic cloves, smashed", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon honey", "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "2 bushy sprigs fresh herbs, such as rosemary, tarragon, thyme, sage, parsley or a mix", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Juice of 1/4 lemon (about 2 teaspoons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, add the tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, honey, vinegar, herbs and red-pepper flakes (if using), and stir to combine.
