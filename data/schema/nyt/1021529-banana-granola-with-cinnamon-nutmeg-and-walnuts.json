{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banana Granola With Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Walnuts", "description": "This banana bread-inspired granola uses real mashed banana, coconut oil, cinnamon, nutmeg and toasted nuts. Keeping it simple allows the subtle banana flavor to shine through, but you can tweak the recipe by adding dried coconut flakes, sesame or pumpkin seeds, more spices, or even chocolate chips or dried fruit. Breaking the granola into large clusters halfway through baking ensures the granola cooks evenly. Allow the granola to sit for at least one hour on the counter to harden completely. Double the recipe if you\u2019d like to stock up your freezer. It will keep at least three months there, at the ready for snacking, or can be served for breakfast, in bowls with milk and freshly sliced banana.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/08/dining/jg-banana-bread-granola/merlin_177593406_df3df31b-d983-43c2-97c4-74da750f7867-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack", "keywords": "banana, brown sugar, cinnamon, coconut oil, oats, old-fashioned rolled oats, walnut, dairy-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 598}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/5 ounces mashed bananas (from about 1 large or 2 small ripe or overripe bananas)", "1/4 packed cup/55 grams dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup/50 grams melted virgin coconut oil", "2 teaspoons lemon juice", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 cups/200 grams old-fashioned rolled oats", "1/4 cup/30 grams walnut halves, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the mashed banana to a medium saucepan along with the brown sugar and coconut oil.
