When choosing a black tea, look to Darjeeling, English or Irish breakfast, or Assam. (For something without caffeine, reach for buckwheat tea and increase the brew time to 20 minutes.) The spices in the salted lime cordial are easily shifted to your pantry and preferences. If you don\u2019t have ground ginger, totally fine. If you want to add cardamom, go for it. The point is to infuse the cordial with a warmth that complements the ginger beer\u2019s sharp spice. Please don\u2019t, however, skip the salt. The hit of salinity enhances the cordial\u2019s flavors. Leftover cordial \u2014 sweet, spiced and deeply sour, can be mixed on its own with sparkling water or tonic or, if you\u2019re looking to incorporate it into an alcoholic drink, into a gimlet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/10noabvrex2-darkstormy/merlin_208251063_99a2ed9d-a80f-404e-901f-e3f63e6b75d2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "black tea, ginger beer, lime, mocktail", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 149}, "recipeIngredient": ["Finely grated zest from 6 limes", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon flaky sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper\u00a0", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\u00a0", "1 1/4 cups fresh lime juice (from about 6 limes)", "2 black tea bags (or 2 tablespoons loose-leaf black tea), such as Darjeeling", "Ice", "3 ounces Chilled Black Tea", "1 ounce Salted Lime Cordial", "4 ounces fresh ginger beer", "Lime wedge"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cordial: In a medium bowl, combine the lime zest, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, pepper and cloves.
