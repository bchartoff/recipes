{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arroz con Gandules (Puerto Rican Rice With Pigeon Peas)", "description": "Every step and ingredient adds something important to this recipe from the Puerto Rican-born chef and writer Reina Gasc\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez. Annatto seeds steeped in oil give the rice its signature marigold hue. The banana leaf imparts a subtle tropical aroma to the rice as it cooks. Olives, ham, beer and peppers with their brine offer salt, fat, acid, umami and a bright pop of color. The sheer number of flavors layered into this dish make it a delight to unpack. The most exhilarating layer is the last one: pegao, the crisp, glassy shards of rice at the bottom of the pot. Gandules (pigeon peas) make this version of rice and beans distinctly Caribbean. Ms. Gasc\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez prefers to start with dry gandules, which her family sometimes ships to her from Puerto Rico, then flavors the pot with some sofrito, a bay leaf or two and a smoked pork neck. If you have trouble finding dry pigeon peas, they are often labeled as toor at Indian grocery stores.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/06/magazine/06mag-eat/06mag-eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "annatto seeds, banana leaf, beer, ham, olives, pigeon peas, red bell pepper, rice, roasted canned pepper", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 211}, "recipeIngredient": ["Fresh or thawed frozen banana leaves, washed and wiped for steaming and serving", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as canola", "2 teaspoons annatto seeds", "1 1/2 ounces ham or pork fatback, small diced (about 1/4 cup)", "1/4 cup sofrito (recipe below)", "2 tablespoons sliced manzanilla olives", "1 tablespoon store-bought or homemade saz\u00f3n spice blend with achiote (see Tip)", "1 1/2 cups cooked pigeon peas, drained (reserve 2 1/2 cups cooking liquid, if possible)", "Store-bought or homemade adobo spice blend (see Tip), to taste", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 cups medium-grain or jasmine rice", "1/2 cup pale, lager-style beer", "1 jarred roasted red pepper, thinly sliced, plus 3 tablespoons brine", "1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 large yellow onion, large diced (about 1 cup)", "1/2 medium red bell pepper, stem, ribs and seeds removed, then large diced", "1/2 medium green bell pepper, stem, ribs and seeds removed, then large diced", "1/2 large cubanelle or Italian frying pepper, stemmed and seeded, then large diced", "5 garlic cloves", "1 loosely packed cup cilantro, roughly chopped", "3 scallions, trimmed and roughly chopped", "1 1/2 aj\u00ed dulce peppers, stemmed and seeded (optional)", "1/4 loosely packed cup roughly chopped culantro (optional)", "3/4 teaspoon store-bought or homemade saz\u00f3n spice blend with achiote (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay 1 banana leaf (or more, if needed) flat on a large cutting board, then set the lid of a large Dutch oven or similar pot on top.
