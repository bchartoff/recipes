But the two together make a dessert that manages to be both comforting and elegant. The scented flesh of the fruit does more than add to the taste of the cheesecake: it transforms the texture, too. This mango cheesecake reminds me of those light French fruit-mousse tarts, with their glassy, mirrored tops. And the color! The radiant, golden yellow is instant sunshine in the kitchen, just as the taste is summer on the tongue.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/14/dining/14COOKING_CHEESECAKE2/14COOKING_CHEESECAKE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 160}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 600, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "398 milligrams", "sugarContent": "44 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces (about 15 2 1/2-by-5-inch) graham crackers", "3 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1 stick butter, softened and cut into pieces", "4 small mangoes (to make approximately 2 cups pur\u00e9e)", "1 1/2 pounds cream cheese", "1 cup superfine sugar", "6 large eggs", "Juice of half a lime"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare cheesecake base: Place graham crackers in the bowl of a food processor.
