{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lambrusco Spritz", "description": "Think of this as a grown-up, but not too grown-up, spritz. Here, grapefruit brightens and plays up the wine\u2019s light bitterness, while buttery green olives add a touch of earthy brine and serve as a welcome snack. Reach for a lighter, sweeter, more citrus-leaning amaro, to avoid masking the bubble\u2019s nuance. For Lambrusco, seek dry or off-dry bottles, and commit to tasting a few until you find what you like. Two to start with: Lambrusco di Sorbara, which is the lightest in color and flavor, with high acidity and plenty of aromatics, and Lambrusco Grasparossa, which is dark in color and bold in flavor with dry tannins and rich berry notes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/10/dining/10spritzrex/merlin_187393278_ce6741c3-02a8-4cc6-a132-8aa92cbfd7db-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "amaro, grapefruit, lambrusco, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 694}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice", "1 1/2 ounces amaro, such as Averna, Montenegro, or Nonino", "1/2 ounce fresh grapefruit juice", "3 ounces dry or off dry Lambrusco", "1 ounce sparkling water, to top", "1 grapefruit wedge", "1 to 3 Castelvetrano olives, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the amaro and grapefruit juice to an ice-filled wine glass or lowball glass.
