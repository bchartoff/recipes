First, combine white wine with the zest of a lemon and reduce until syrupy. Add a generous amount of cream and allow to simmer until it thickens slightly. Toss the pasta with the sauce, a bit of pasta water and Parmesan cheese and stir to coat, adding pasta water if the sauce isn't coming together. Top with extra Parm if you so desire (we always do). If you need a bit more heft, consider topping the noodles with saut\u00e9ed fish, shrimp or chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/20/dining/20COOKING-SPAGHETTILIMONE2/20COOKING-SPAGHETTILIMONE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 693}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 635, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "501 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "1 1/2 cups dry white wine", "3/4 to 1\u00bd cups heavy cream, to taste", "1 pound\u00a0spaghetti", "3 tablespoons butter, in pieces", "3 1/2 to 4 ounces Parmesan cheese, freshly grated", "1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, to taste", "Sea salt and fresh black pepper, to taste."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Zest lemon and slice zest into matchsticks.
