{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Goop and Vinaigrette", "description": "The first time I made this lemon concoction, I called it \u201cgoop,\u201d and still haven\u2019t found a better name. My inspiration was an offbeat lemon jam I\u2019d had in a Paris bistro. The jam, which I think was served with mackerel, was thick, velvety, salty, tangy, only a bit sweet and made with salt-cured preserved lemons. Haunted by the flavor and not patient enough to wait a month for lemons to cure, I cooked ordinary lemons, some with their peel, in a sugar-and-salt syrup, then blended them into a kind of marmalade, the goop. It\u2019s excellent swiped over cooked fish, seafood, chicken or vegetables. The syrup, fragrant and full flavored, is terrific in marinades and great mixed with a little goop, sherry and cider vinegars, honey and oil to make a vinaigrette for beans, grains and hearty salads. I guess that goop is technically a condiment, but I call it a transformer. It\u2019s that good.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/07/magazine/07mag-eat/07mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "2/3 cup goop, 3/4 cup syrup and 1 scant cup vinaigrette", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "condiments, salads and dressings", "keywords": "honey, lemon, sugar, vinegar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 944}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large lemons", "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "6 tablespoons olive oil", "2 tablespoons goop syrup", "2 tablespoons goop", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "2 tablespoons cider vinegar", "1 teaspoon honey", "Salt and pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the goop and syrup: Remove the zest from 3 lemons, taking care not to include any white cottony pith.
