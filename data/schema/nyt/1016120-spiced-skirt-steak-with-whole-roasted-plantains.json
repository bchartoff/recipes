{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Skirt Steak With Whole Roasted Plantains", "description": "Arrachera, the cut of meat that is usually translated as \"skirt steak,\" is very popular for grilling in Latin America, and also in the United States among butchers \u2014 because they know the difference between the inside and the outside skirt. The arrachera is the outside skirt, and it's thicker, much more flavorful and usually more tender than the inside, a flatter and fibrous cut. (The names refer to which part lies deeper inside the animal.) The chef Eric Werner serves this at Hartwood, in Tulum, Mexico, where all the cooking is done over wood; if you have a grill, this steak will benefit from it. Cook it over high heat, but just for long enough to sear the outside. The plantains are absurdly simple to make but have an especially lovely texture from being roasted in their skins. Think of them together as steak and potatoes, and serve with a salad to make a fast weeknight dinner.
