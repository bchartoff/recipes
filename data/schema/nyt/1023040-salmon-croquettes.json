{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon Croquettes\u00a0", "description": "These croquettes have what may just be the perfect texture combination: crispy outsides and tender insides. Made from simple ingredients, they\u2019re also a great use of leftovers, putting to work those halves of onion and bell pepper from last night\u2019s dinner, and any remaining salmon, though you can also use canned (boneless works best). The filling may be a little delicate when you put it together, but a quick pop in the fridge or freezer makes it easier to work with. Serve the croquettes alone as an appetizer with tartar sauce or hot sauce, or make them a bigger meal alongside grits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/15/dining/mp-salmon-croquettes/merlin_203653686_01737897-e258-411c-8f03-e3789827540c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 main-course servings, 4 appetizer servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, seafood, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, panko, salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 663}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) can boneless, skinless salmon or 1 pound cooked salmon", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1/2 green bell pepper, finely chopped\u00a0", "1/2 cup diced onion", "1 garlic clove, grated\u00a0\u00a0", "2 eggs, lightly beaten", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley", "1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay", "1 teaspoon hot sauce, plus more for serving", "1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper\u00a0", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "2 teaspoons seasoning of choice, such as onion powder, garlic powder, paprika or a combination", "Vegetable or canola oil, for frying", "Tartar sauce, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using canned salmon, drain and discard the liquid.
