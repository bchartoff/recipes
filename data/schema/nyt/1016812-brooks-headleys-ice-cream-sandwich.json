Brooks Headley, the pastry chef from Del Posto, is encouraging you to make an ice-cream sandwich with store-bought white bread and a tub of Ben & Jerry\u2019s Cherry Garcia?\n\nIndeed. And he\u2019ll even make the cheeky argument that this quick treat has Italian roots. \u201cA typical Sicilian breakfast is gelato on a brioche roll,\u201d he said. \u201cIce cream for breakfast! Who isn\u2019t going to love that?\u201d Truth be told, for a dessert at Del Posto Mr. Headley would most likely use a preserved-cherry and stracciatella gelato, but its flavor and texture are not so far off from what you get with Ben & Jerry\u2019s. So butter the bread, crisp it up in a pan, let it cool, then coat it with ice cream and smush it all together. \u201cI finish it with olive oil because, in the words of the great chef Paul Bertolli, olive oil is the best sauce,\u201d Mr. Headley said. He called the result \u201cadmittedly trashy, but wildly satisfying.\u201d How could it not be?", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/17/dining/17HEADLEYSIDE/HEADLEYSIDE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, quick, snack, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "bread, ice cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 109}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 121, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "115 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 slices white bread (preferably Pepperidge Farm)", "1 cup gelato or ice cream (of your preference, but the author suggests Ben & Jerry\u2019s Cherry Garcia), softened but not melting", "1 teaspoon unsalted butter", "Coarse sea salt", "Extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Smear the bread with butter and sear in a cast-iron or nonstick pan until lightly caramelized and golden.
