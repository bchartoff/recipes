{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Leeks With Parmesan", "description": "My friend Elizabeth tells me that even people who think they don't like leeks like this dish. The leeks are braised in wine and water or stock until soft and golden, then topped with Parmesan and run under a broiler, so you get a crunchy layer on top of soft cooked leeks. One of the tricks here is to discard the outer layers that become papery when you cook them, so that the whole leek will be soft and easy to cut through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/07/science/07recipehealth/07recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "gluten-free, healthy, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian, leek, parmesan, white wine, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 331}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 135, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "278 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 leeks, not too thick if possible", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1/2 cup dry white wine, like sauvignon blanc", "1 1/2 ounces Parmesan, freshly grated (1/3 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the ends and the dark green leaves of the leeks, and cut in half lengthwise.

Place the leeks in the pan, cut side down, and cook, shaking the pan and moving them around with tongs, until they are lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using tongs, turn the leeks over and cook on the other side until they are lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn the leeks back over so that the cut side is down. Peel off the outer layers if they are papery, as they will not soften when the leeks are braised. Pour in the wine and stir to deglaze the bottom of the pan, then add enough water or stock to come just to the top of the leeks. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes, until the leeks are thoroughly tender when pierced with a knife. Most of the liquid should have evaporated by this time. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Transfer the leeks to an oiled ovenproof pan if your skillet cannot go under the broiler.
