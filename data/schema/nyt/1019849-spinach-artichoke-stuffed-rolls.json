{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach-Artichoke Stuffed Rolls", "description": "These fluffy rolls look unassuming on the outside, but on the inside, they're generously filled with creamy spinach-artichoke dip. They're inspired by bierock, a bun of Eastern European origin that is traditionally stuffed with ground meat and onions \u2014 but this creamy meatless version takes the cake. If you have a little spinach-artichoke dip leftover, snack on it hot or cold with pita chips, or use it to fill a sandwich or an omelet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/21/dining/spinach-artichoke-rolls/spinach-artichoke-rolls-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "9 rolls", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, cream cheese, frozen spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 100}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 497, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "546 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/295 milliliters whole milk", "5 cups/600 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg, plus 1 large egg yolk", "3 tablespoons/45 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing", "1 tablespoon instant yeast", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "14 ounces/395 grams canned artichoke hearts, drained and chopped", "10 ounces/285 grams frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed to remove excess liquid", "8 ounces/225 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/85 grams finely grated Parmesan", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 egg", "Sesame seeds, for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, heat the milk over medium-low until just warm to the touch (about 95 degrees)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the flour, sugar, egg and egg yolk, butter, yeast, salt and the warm milk.
