{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Six-Foot Meatless Italian Hero", "description": "This sandwich serves many dainty folks or fewer rugged types. Preorder the bread from an Italian bakery or deli counter, and build first, season last. Success here is in achieving a perfect filling-to-bread ratio, a generousness with the seasonings, and the ability to close the sandwich around the filling without finding it woefully over- or under-stuffed when it\u2019s time to slice. It\u2019s a huge help to have on hand 8-inch wooden skewers, disposable gloves, a good serrated knife and an egg-slicer gadget. The assembly instructions here are meant to be helpful but not prescriptive, as I trust that everybody knows how to build a sandwich to their own liking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/27/magazine/27mag-eat/20mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 six-foot hero (serves 12 to 30, depending on the group)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "celery heart, eggs, green bell pepper, jalape\u00f1o, provolone, tomato, fourth of july, labor day, tailgate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 264}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 green bell peppers", "1 medium head iceberg lettuce", "5 firm hothouse beefsteak tomatoes", "1 bunch celery hearts", "1 bunch flat-leaf parsley", "2 (14-ounce) cans artichoke hearts", "14 garlic cloves, peeled", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil (approximately 1 to 1 1/2 cups)", "2 large red onions, peeled", "1 (6-foot) seeded Italian loaf (special order)", "Red-wine vinegar", "1 shy quart (not quite a full 4 cups) mayonnaise (preferably Hellmann\u2019s)", "2 pounds sliced provolone", "2 (6-ounce) cans sliced pitted California black olives", "24 large eggs, hard-boiled, peeled and sliced", "2 (12-ounce) jars sliced pickled jalape\u00f1os", "2 (12-ounce) jars sliced cubanelle or banana peppers", "Dried oregano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash and dry bell peppers, iceberg, tomatoes, celery hearts and parsley."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grind artichokes in a food processor with the peeled garlic and a pinch or 2 of salt, until largely pur\u00e9ed but still textural, like tapenade.
