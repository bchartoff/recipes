The dough can be cut and baked immediately, or stored in the freezer and baked to order. Brush with heavy cream and sprinkle with sugar before they go into the oven, and you\u2019ll have a batch of scones with perfect crackly tops. These are best served warm with a generous slather of salted butter and a dot of piquant marmalade, but they\u2019ll keep for a day or two if stored in an airtight container at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/19/dining/yk-brandied-fruit-scones/merlin_180213357_baf49acd-fa87-4596-adb9-81db3437d09e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "16 scones", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "flour, heavy cream, scone, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 277}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling (which is optional, but encouraged)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 cup/170 grams cold unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 cup/180 grams drained <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021676\">brandied dried fruit</a>", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters cold heavy cream, plus more for brushing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
