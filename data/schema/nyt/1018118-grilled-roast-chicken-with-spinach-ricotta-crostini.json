{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Roast Chicken With Spinach-Ricotta Crostini", "description": "This whole chicken cooked on the grill is truly a best-of-both-worlds recipe: You get the incredibly succulent meat and brittle-crisp, burnished skin of a roast chicken, combined with the deep smoky flavor of the grill. To make it, you essentially use your grill like an outdoor oven, cooking a whole splayed chicken in a skillet instead of directly on the grill grate. Splaying the bird first \u2014 that is, flattening the legs so they lay flat in the skillet \u2014 helps the dark meat cook quickly and evenly. The skillet helps to distribute the heat and captures the juices, which would otherwise incinerate in the fire. Those juices are then put to good use as a cooking medium for dill-flecked, garlicky spinach. The greens absorb all of the chicken drippings before being heaped upon ricotta-smeared crostini. Added bonus: You don\u2019t have to worry about setting off your smoke detector. Here, the smoke stays in the grill with the bird, which is exactly where you want it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/19/multimedia/clark-grilled-chicken/clark-grilled-chicken-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "ancho chili powder, chicken, dill, ricotta, spinach, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 237}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 797, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "60 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "1327 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon high-quality chile powder (ancho or New Mexican are nice)", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon (save the zested lemon to juice over the crostini)", "1 whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), patted dry", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 anchovies (optional)", "Pinch red pepper flakes", "1 pound mature spinach leaves, cleaned (12 cups)", "1 cup chopped dill", "4 slices crusty country-style bread, 1/2-inch thick", "Fresh ricotta, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, chile powder and lemon zest.
