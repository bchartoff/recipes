{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Naan-o Paneer-o Sabzi (Bread, Feta and Herb Platter)", "description": "The heart and soul of the Iranian table, this humble and satisfying meal is a simple combination of briny cheese, fresh herbs, walnuts and flatbread. Taken together, they make a perfect bite, known as loghmeh in Persian. A summer platter can include cooling watermelon, crunchy grapes and crisp Persian cucumber. Think of the suggestions below as an open canvas and add your preferred summer fruits and vegetables. Enjoy this for breakfast or brunch with a cup of hot black tea, as an afternoon snack, or as a beautiful, refreshing and light dinner with a glass of your favorite beverage. This is meant for those long, lazy summer nights when all you want to do is nibble and get lost in good conversation with good friends.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/04/dining/nd-bread-feta-and-fresh-herb-platter/merlin_192092505_cd3873b7-ce17-4056-9099-6e472b439663-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, finger foods, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "feta, lavash, walnut halves, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 324}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup walnut halves", "Salt", "5 to 6 ounces lavash or pita bread, cut into smaller pieces", "10 ounces feta cheese, sliced or cubed", "1 bunch Persian basil or sweet Italian basil, lemon basil or Thai basil (see Tip)", "1 bunch mint", "4 scallions, cut into 2-inch lengths", "1 small watermelon, cut into wedges or cubed", "1 bunch radishes, cut into quarters or slices, or kept whole", "4 Persian cucumbers, cut into halves or slices, or kept whole", "1 bunch grapes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Traditionally, walnuts are soaked to remove their bitterness and to make them crisp and more digestible.
