{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broccolini and Edamame Salad With Coconut", "description": "Sprouting broccoli (or broccolini) mixed with edamame and coconut is typical of the inventive combinations favored by the British chef Yotam Ottolenghi. After blanching, the vegetables are seasoned with black mustard seeds and curry leaves, which makes for an extremely aromatic and compelling dish that\u2019s good warm or at room temperature. As for the fresh coconut, you can buy frozen freshly grated coconut at many international grocery stores. Otherwise, to use a fresh coconut, use a screwdriver to poke two or three holes, preferably in the eyes of the coconut. Drain any water, then use a hammer to bang along the equator of coconut until it splits open, and scoop out the flesh. Place flesh in a food processor fitted with a grating disc and grate. One coconut yields more flesh than you\u2019ll need for this recipe; freeze the extra for up to three months.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/10/dining/10COOKBOOK1/10COOKBOOK1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "quick, snack", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, broccoli, broccolini, coconut, curry, edamame", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 336, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "48 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 ounces (2 bunches) purple sprouting broccoli or broccolini, trimmed", "1/2 pound haricots verts, trimmed", "7 ounces (about 1/2 cup) shelled frozen edamame", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium yellow onion, finely diced", "2 1/2 teaspoons black mustard seeds", "30 fresh curry leaves, or 40 dried curry leaves", "3 whole dried chiles", "Zest of 1 lime, plus 1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice, more to taste", "Zest of 1 lime", "2/3 cup cilantro leaves", "2/3 cup fresh coarsely grated coconut"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
