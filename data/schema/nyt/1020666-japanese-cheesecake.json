{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Japanese Cheesecake", "description": "Japanese cheesecakes, sometimes called souffl\u00e9 or cotton cheesecakes, have a melt-in-the-mouth texture that\u2019s like a classic cheesecake crossed with an ethereal sponge cake. This one, adapted from Joanne Chang of Boston\u2019s Flour Bakery, has bright lemon tanginess and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche richness as well. It\u2019s best made the day before you plan to serve it, and will keep for up to 4 days in the refrigerator. Serve it plain and minimalist, with a sprinkle of confectioners\u2019 sugar on top, or with fresh berries for added color and juiciness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/dining/03bakingbookrex2/03bakingbookrex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "cake flour, cream cheese, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, lemon zest, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 442}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons/45 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing", "5 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup/225 grams cream cheese", "1/2 cup/120 grams cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/100 grams plus 1 tablespoon superfine sugar", "1/2 cup/65 grams cake flour", "1 tablespoon confectioners\u2019 sugar, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400 degrees.
