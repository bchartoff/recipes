{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orzo Salad With Lentils and Zucchini", "description": "The key to vibrant yet substantial summer salads is to mix raw and cooked ingredients and incorporate as many textures as possible. This one achieves that abundance in a streamlined manner by cooking lentils and orzo together in one pot. Start with the lentils, then add the orzo partway through cooking so both become tender at once. (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/dining/one-pot-boiling-water.html\">You can do the same</a> with any boiling ingredients.) The chewy orzo and velvety lentils then meet crisp, raw zucchini, crunchy nuts, and the pep of pickled peppers, scallions, lemon and a whole lot of fresh herbs \u2014 none of which requires more than a little chopping from you. Eat this protein-rich salad on its own, or add soft-boiled eggs, tinned fish, feta or pecorino, as you wish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/AS-orzo-lentil-and-zucchini-salad-15SALADREX/AS-orzo-lentil-and-zucchini-salad-15SALADREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "lentils, orzo, pepperoncini, scallion, zucchini, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 462}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 cup green or brown lentils", "1 cup orzo", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup lemon juice (from 2 lemons)", "1/4 cup sliced pickled pepperoncini (about 6 to 8 peppers)", "Black pepper", "1 pound zucchini or summer squash, or a combination, preferably small to medium, trimmed", "2/3 cup raw pistachios or walnuts, coarsely chopped", "3 scallions, thinly sliced", "1 cup firmly packed whole herb leaves, such as basil, mint, dill, parsley, tarragon, oregano or a mix"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
