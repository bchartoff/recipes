In this vegetarian version, cauliflower, rather than chicken, is caramelized on one side, then simmered in the pungent but not prickly sauce until toothsome yet tender. The simmer mellows the vinegar and soy sauce into a sauce interlaced with pepper, garlic and something herbal but not immediately traceable \u2014 that\u2019s the bay leaves. Serve the cauliflower and sauce over rice or another grain with something green on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/dining/as-cauliflower-adobo/as-cauliflower-adobo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "cauliflower, rice wine vinegar, scallion, soy sauce, main course, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1159}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 157, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1137 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large cauliflower (2 1/2 to 3 pounds)", "Kosher salt", "2 teaspoons black pepper, plus more as needed", "3 tablespoons canola oil, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup rice-wine vinegar", "5 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons raw or light brown sugar", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "3 bay leaves", "1 Thai chile, halved lengthwise, or 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "3 scallions, thinly sliced, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim leaves and woody stalk from the cauliflower, then cut through the root into 8 wedges.
