Aside from good toasted bread, it requires very few ingredients: a garlic clove, a ripe tomato, some olive oil and flaky sea salt. In fact, the ingredient list is actually the recipe in shorthand. If you want a slightly more elaborate toast, garnish with anchovy fillets, slices of avocado or grilled shrimp. But even in its simplest form, this rustic toast is always satisfying.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/23/dining/23KITCH1/23KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 toasts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, bread", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 50}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 146, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "195 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 slices of bread from a plain rustic loaf, about 1/2-inch thick", "1 garlic clove, peeled", "1 small ripe red tomato, halved, seeds squeezed out", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Flaky sea salt or fleur de sel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toast the bread on both sides under the broiler, on a stovetop grill or over coals, until it is perfectly browned, with a bit of give in the center, about 1 minute per side."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pressing down firmly, rub the top of each toast with the garlic.
