{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Plum Almond Tart", "description": "This beautiful plum tart, adapted from the pastry chef Alex Levin of Osteria Morini in Washington, brings together a sabl\u00e9 butter crust flavored with vanilla bean; colorful, juicy plum slices; and an almond cream filling with a lovely flavor that complements the fruit. Using confectioners' sugar in the crust gives you a texture that is finer and smoother than if you use  granulated sugar. And the sugar in the crust and filling removes the need to sweeten the plums (which in turn means the fruit juices won't leach into the dough) \u2014\u00a0though you'll want to sprinkle a little turbinado sugar over the top for added crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/21/dining/21ROSH2/21ROSH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "almond, plum, vanilla bean, dessert, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 126}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 441, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "79 milligrams", "sugarContent": "28 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick) or 1/2 cup solid coconut oil, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/94 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped", "1 large egg", "1 1/2 cups/187 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/120 grams blanched almonds", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick) or coconut oil at room temperature", "1 cup/120 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk", "About 1 1/2 pounds/680 grams Italian plums or other flavorful, colorful plums", "A few pinches of turbinado or other textured raw sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Combine butter or oil, confectioners\u2019 sugar, salt and vanilla bean seeds in a stand mixer on low speed for 1 minute.
