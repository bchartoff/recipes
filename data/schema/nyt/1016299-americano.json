For bartenders and barflies, this deliciously complex mix of Campari, gin and sweet vermouth has become an easy way to fly one\u2019s flag as a knowing cocktail classicist. But the drink\u2019s rising profile has cast a shadow over its once-popular progenitor, the Americano. Without this refreshing Italian-born highball \u2014 Campari, sweet vermouth and club soda \u2014 there would have been no blueprint for the gin-loving Count Camillo Negroni to experiment with a century ago. (The drink\u2019s family line actually goes back even farther; the Americano grew out of a simpler aperitif that omitted the soda, called the Milano-Torino \u2014 Milano in honor of the birthplace of Campari, Torino for the vermouth.)\n<br/><br/>\nWhile the Americano doesn\u2019t have quite the romance that\u2019s grown around the Negroni, it also doesn\u2019t have nearly as much alcohol. It\u2019s a lighter and saner choice for summertime drinking. A pitcher of Americanos enjoyed on the back patio during a hot afternoon will not leave you down for the, uh, count.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/20/dining/video-summer-drinks-americano/video-summer-drinks-americano-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "campari, club soda, sweet vermouth, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 69}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces Campari", "1 1/2 ounces sweet vermouth", "Club soda", "Orange twist, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine 1 1/2 ounces Campari with 1 1/2 ounces sweet vermouth in a highball glass filled with ice.
