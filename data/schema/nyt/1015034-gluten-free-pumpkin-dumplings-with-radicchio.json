It's incredibly easy. Just mix together a can of pumpkin pur\u00e9e, a couple eggs and a cup of gluten-free flour blend. Plop spoonfuls into a pot of boiling water, and in minutes \u2013 dumplings. Toss those with a quick saut\u00e9 of onion, red pepper flakes and radicchio for a filling, healthy dinner. The dumplings are super light and pillowy, but if you prefer a firmer texture, add more gluten-free flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to the pasta dough.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/01/health/01well_glutenb/01well_glutenb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, fall, gluten-free flour blend, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, radicchio, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 258, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "521 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 15-ounce can pure pumpkin puree", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 cup store-bought gluten-free flour blend", "Salt", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes", "1 small head radicchio, sliced into 1/4-inch strips (about 2 cups)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
