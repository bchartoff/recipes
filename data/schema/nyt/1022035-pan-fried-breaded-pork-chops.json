{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Fried Breaded Pork Chops", "description": "Look for beautiful good-quality pork, such as Berkshire, and ask for center-cut loin chops with bone. For the bread crumbs, use day-old firm white sandwich bread or French loaf, cubed and whirled in a food processor, for about three cups of soft, fluffy crumbs. Dry, fine store-bought crumbs will not yield the same result. Make sure to fry these chops very gently over medium-high heat, to allow the bread-crumb coating to brown slowly, creating a crisp, golden crust.
