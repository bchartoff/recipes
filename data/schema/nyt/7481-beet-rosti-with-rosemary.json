{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beet Rosti With Rosemary", "description": "The sweetness of beets is wonderfully exploited in this dish, created by Michael Romano, the chef at Union Square Cafe. It's a thick beet pancake, cooked slowly until the beet sugars caramelize and a crunchy, sweet crust forms, reminiscent of cr\u00e9me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. A touch of rosemary does not diminish the sweetness, but simply adds a dimension to this versatile side dish, which is good with braised meats or grilled food or can accompany a salad as a light dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/12/dining/12COOKING-BEET-ROSTI1/12COOKING-BEET-ROSTI1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pancakes", "keywords": "beets, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 162}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "583 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds beets (3 very large or 4 to 6 medium)", "2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/2 cup flour", "2 tablespoons butter", "Minced parsley or a few rosemary leaves for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim beets, and peel them as you would potatoes; grate them in food processor or by hand.
