{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Split Pea Soup With Horseradish Cream", "description": "The pressure cooker turns simple ingredients into a creamy and satisfying soup in under an hour. Split peas are a type of field pea that\u2019s been dried and split. They have been eaten around the world for ages, because they are cheap, nonperishable and widely available. This recipe is enriched a ham hock, which provides salty pork bits. Ham hocks can be harder to find, but they are also inexpensive and add body and flavor to soups \u2014 and freeze well, so they are worth having on hand. If you don\u2019t have a ham hock, you can use a leftover ham bone or diced thick-cut ham, or toss in some crisped bacon at the end.
