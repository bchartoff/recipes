But no one asked me, and rather than do a complete overhaul on the most iconic cookie known to man, I took all my favorite parts and invented something else entirely. Made with lots of salted butter (it has a slightly different flavor and a deeper saltiness than using just salt \u2014 I prefer unsalted butter everywhere else but here), the dough has just enough flour to hold it together and the right amount of light brown sugar to suggest a chocolate chip cookie.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/12/dining/16COOKING-SHORTBREADCOOKIES3/16COOKING-SHORTBREADCOOKIES3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 5221}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 267, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "135 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/255 grams total salted butter (2\u00bc sticks), cold (room temperature if you're using a handheld mixer), cut into \u00bd-inch pieces (see note)", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar\u00a0", "1/4 cup/55 grams light brown sugar\u00a0", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract\u00a0", "2 1/2 cups/325 grams all-purpose flour (see Tip)", "6 ounces/170 grams semi-sweet or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (not too fine; you want chunks, not little shards)", "1 large egg, beaten\u00a0", "Demerara sugar, for rolling\u00a0", "Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.

Using a spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and, with the mixer on low, slowly add the flour, followed by the chocolate chunks, and mix just to blend.

Fold the plastic over so that it covers the dough to protect your hands from getting all sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a log shape; rolling it on the counter will help you smooth it out, but don\u2019t worry about getting it totally perfect. (Don't be afraid to make them compact. Shortbread is supposed to be dense. That's part of why it's so good.) You can also do this using parchment paper, if you prefer, but plastic wrap is easier when it comes to shaping the log. Each half should form a 6-inch log, 2 to 2\u00bc inches in diameter.

Sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until the edges are just beginning to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating them all."}]}
