{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nectarines and Berries With Flavored Whipped Cream", "description": "Macerated desserts are simply fruit steeped in a flavored sugar syrup, wine, liquor, vinegar or citrus juice, usually for a couple of hours or overnight. During the process, the fruit becomes slightly softer, its flavor infused with spices, juices or wine. Fruit can be nicely complemented not only by a simple sugar syrup, but also by orange or lemon juice, wine, liqueurs and vinegar.\nAny soft fruit, like bananas, mangoes or papayas, should be added at the end. Basil or mint leaves, orange or lemon zest and star anise will also add some zing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Karen Baar"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "berries, cream, nectarine, dessert, gluten-free, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 654, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "57 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "sodiumContent": "127 milligrams", "sugarContent": "43 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups ripe nectarines, sliced 1/4 inch thick", "1 pint raspberries", "1 pint blackberries", "2 tablespoons good-quality balsamic vinegar", "2 tablespoons sugar", "Pinch salt", "Pinch freshly ground black pepper", "2 1/2 cups whipping cream", "3 tablespoons sugar", "2 teaspoons fresh lavender flowers (optional)", "Zest of 1 orange", "Mint leaves for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large nonreactive bowl, mix the fruit, vinegar, sugar and pinches of salt and pepper.
