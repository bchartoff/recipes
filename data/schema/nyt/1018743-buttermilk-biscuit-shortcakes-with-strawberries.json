{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttermilk-Biscuit Shortcakes With Strawberries", "description": "Making biscuits is a combination of technique, faith and magic. You pull the dough together with your hands, pass through a stage where only a belief in the baking gods keeps you from ditching the mess and then, presto chango, the dough smoothes, and the oven\u2019s heat makes them rise tall and beautiful. These biscuits are sweeter than most, because they\u2019re meant to be shortcakes topped with berries and cream. (For a savory biscuit, use just 1 teaspoon sugar and omit the citrus zest, if you\u2019d like.) Although they\u2019re best soon after they\u2019ve come from the oven, here\u2019s a baker\u2019s trick that makes biscuits a convenience food: Freeze the cut-out dough. When you\u2019re ready to bake, let the pucks sit out to warm a bit while you preheat the oven; give them an extra minute or two of baking time if you think they need it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/30/magazine/30desserts/30desserts-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "butter, buttermilk, orange, strawberries, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 243}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "253 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 hibiscus tea bag (like Red Zinger)", "1/3 cup (80 ml.) boiling water", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1 fat strip orange, lemon or lime zest", "1 pound (about 25) strawberries, hulled and coarsely chopped", "3 tablespoons sugar", "Finely grated zest of 1 orange, lemon or lime", "2 cups (272 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "6 tablespoons (85 grams) very cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces", "3/4 cup cold buttermilk", "1 pound (about 25) strawberries, hulled and halved from top to bottom", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 cup (240 ml.) heavy cream", "2 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the saucy berries: Steep the tea bag in boiling water for 5 minutes; pour the tea into a medium pot.
