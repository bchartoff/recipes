She calls it 'dump-it cake' because you mix all of the ingredients in a pot over medium heat, then dump the batter into a cake pan to bake. For the icing, you melt Nestl\u00e9's semisweet-chocolate chips and swirl them together with sour cream. It sounds as if it's straight from the Pillsbury Bake-Off, but it tastes as if it's straight from Payard. Everyone loves it.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/11/dining/ah-chocolate-dump-it-cake/merlin_147611010_cc3b9466-1485-485c-a638-f464b3cabcec-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butter, sugar, unsweetened chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3488}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 619, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "81 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "426 milligrams", "sugarContent": "57 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups sugar", "4 ounces unsweetened chocolate", "1 stick unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 cup milk", "1 teaspoon cider vinegar", "2 eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla", "1 1/2 cups Nestle's semisweet-chocolate chips", "1 1/2 cups sour cream, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and place a baking sheet on the lowest rack to catch any drips as the cake bakes on the middle rack.
