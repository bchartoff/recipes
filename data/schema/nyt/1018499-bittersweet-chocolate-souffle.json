{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bittersweet Chocolate Souffl\u00e9", "description": "Dark and intense in flavor, yet with a light and custardy texture, a chocolate souffl\u00e9 is an eternal showstopper of a dessert. To get that intense chocolate flavor, this version uses a base of melted butter and chocolate without any starch. Be sure to use excellent bittersweet chocolate, but if you prefer a slightly sweeter souffl\u00e9, feel free to substitute milk chocolate for all or part of the bittersweet. Or to move the souffl\u00e9 in the other direction, substitute a chocolate with a higher cocoa solids ratio, 70 to 75 percent, which will decrease the overall sugar. For maximum \"wow\" factor, always serve a souffl\u00e9 straight from the oven. Cr\u00e8me anglaise or chocolate sauce would be fine accompaniments, as would scoops of your favorite ice cream.
