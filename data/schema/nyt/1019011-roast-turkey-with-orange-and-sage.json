{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Turkey With Orange and Sage", "description": "Roast turkey with white wine and a lot of butter, too, as it happens. The butter, massaged under the bird's skin, does a lot to help keep the breast meat moist, and the juice and wine in the pan below the bird create a deliciously steamy environment for the roasting. The combination leads to an interesting outcome: a bird that crisps up nicely not at the beginning of cooking, but at the end. The sweet-savory drippings make for excellent gravy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/dining/ss-roast-turkey-with-orange-and-sage/ss-roast-turkey-with-orange-and-sage-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "fall, winter, main course, orange, sage, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 535}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 749, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "92 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1037 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 12- to 14-pound turkey, giblets removed", "1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature", "Zest of 1 orange", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste", "1/2 of a 750-milliliter bottle dry white wine", "2 cups\u00a0orange juice", "10 to 12 fresh sage leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
