If you\u2019re skipping the cherries or don\u2019t have time to run out to stock up, you can simply add a bit more simple syrup to taste while blending. You\u2019ll lose the brilliant color contrast \u2014 and the outright fun of snacking on ice-cold, candylike cherries \u2014 but, like most good drinks, this one\u2019s adaptable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/13/dining/13slushies1/merlin_174184356_71cb39b4-41ee-4ab1-bfad-6251f52ccf56-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H10M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "gin, lemon juice, maraschino cherry, simple syrup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 525}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces gin", "6 ounces fresh lemon juice (from 3 to 4 large lemons)", "4 ounces <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014441-simple-syrup\">simple syrup</a> (1:1 granulated sugar and water)", "5 to 6 cups cracked or crushed ice cubes", "Maraschino cherries and syrup, preferably Luxardo, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In an airtight container, combine the gin, lemon juice and simple syrup.
