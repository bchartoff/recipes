{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Zucchini and Carrot Fritters With Yogurt-Mint Dip", "description": "These crispy fritters, which Melissa Clark developed for her picky daughter, are also an ideal cocktail accompaniment. Hot, salty and crunchy: They can be devoured in one or two bites. To make them, combine shredded or diced carrots and zucchini, lemon zest and scallion with a light batter of flour, egg, milk, coriander and pepper. Let them rest for a half-hour so the vegetables can soften, then drop the battered vegetables by the spoonful into the oil and fry until golden all over. Sprinkle with salt and serve with a creamy dip of yogurt, mint and garlic, and watch them disappear.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/28/dining/Zucchini-and-Carrot-Fritters/Zucchini-and-Carrot-Fritters-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 dozen fritters", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, carrot, zucchini, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 323}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 70, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "61 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup all-purpose flour, more as needed", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon coriander", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more for serving", "1 cup milk, more as needed", "1 large egg", "1/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1/4 teaspoon pepper", "2 large carrots, grated (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 large zucchini, grated (about 2 cups)", "2 scallions, finely chopped", "1 garlic clove, finely chopped", "1/2 cup plain yogurt", "1 tablespoon chopped mint", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "Olive oil, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the batter for the fritters: in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, coriander and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
