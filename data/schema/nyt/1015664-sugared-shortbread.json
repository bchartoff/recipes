{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sugared Shortbread", "description": "In 2012, The Times invited readers to submit their favorite cookie recipes. Amy Casey of Sparta, N.J., submitted this unusual recipe for shortbread that calls for melted butter and a little bit of rice flour (which is now relatively easy to find since it\u2019s a popular gluten-free flour). You can mix this recipe in a bowl with a wooden spoon in about three minutes, and the rice flour gives the shortbread a sandy, singular texture that\u2019s accentuated by the coating of granulated sugar on the top and bottom. You can substitute cornstarch for the rice flour, but you'll end up with a slightly softer crumb. Bonus: this keeps for weeks \u2014 but only if you hide it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/15/dining/sugared-shortbread/sugared-shortbread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 18 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert, flour, shortbread, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 762}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 160, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "66 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["240 grams all-purpose flour (2 cups)", "36 grams rice flour (1/4 cup)", "62 grams sugar (1/4 cup), more as needed", "2 grams fine sea salt (1/2 teaspoon)", "16 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 cup), melted and cooled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
