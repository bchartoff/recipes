Creamy and starchy Yukon Gold potatoes work well here, as do russets. Boil them until tender, then make sure to save the water you boiled them in, because you\u2019ll use that in the dough, too. Eat the rolls warm, slathered with butter, or turn them into a delicious sandwich. Either way, they stay soft and delicious for a couple of days at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/18/dining/ya-potato-rolls/merlin_183942219_3d37c507-cf3d-47ca-831f-75720a6c50c3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "9 rolls", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, breads, side dish", "keywords": "active dry yeast, butter, egg, flour, potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 345}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium Yukon Gold or russet potato (about 6 ounces), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon active dry yeast", "4 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/57 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted and cooled, plus more for greasing\u00a0", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "Olive oil, for greasing the bowl"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the potato in a medium pot or saucepan and cover with water.
