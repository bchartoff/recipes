{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Roasted Salmon Ni\u00e7oise Salad", "description": "Here, the classic French salad becomes an elegant dinner, with mustard-glazed salmon in place of tuna, roasted vegetables and jammy eggs served over a jumble of salad greens tossed with a red-wine vinaigrette. Roasting the vegetables, rather than serving some steamed and some raw as you would for a traditional\u00a0Ni\u00e7oise, gives this dish great texture and a delicious contrast of temperatures. The vegetables and salmon are roasted on a single sheet pan, making this an elevated take on the one-dish dinner \u2014 fit for company and easy enough for a weeknight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/06/dining/heuck-salmon-nicoise/heuck-salmon-nicoise-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, salads and dressings, seafood", "keywords": "anchovy, green beans, lettuce, olives, potato, salmon, tomato, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 411}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound baby Yukon Gold potatoes, halved", "8 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 1/4 teaspoons black pepper", "2 large eggs", "2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 1 clove)", "1 anchovy fillet, minced (optional)", "6 ounces haricots verts or green beans, trimmed", "1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes", "1/2 cup pitted olives, preferably Ni\u00e7oise or Kalamata", "4 (6-ounce) center-cut, skin-on salmon fillets", "5 ounces tender salad greens, like baby red and green leaf lettuce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and place a rack near the top of the oven.
