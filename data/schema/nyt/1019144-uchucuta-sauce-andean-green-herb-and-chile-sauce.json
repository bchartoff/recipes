{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Uchucuta Sauce (Andean Green Herb and Chile Sauce)", "description": "Uchucuta means ground chiles in the Quechua language. The main ingredients in a traditional sour and spicy sauce include the hard-to-find Peruvian huacatay and other wild herbs. I have improvised without them, using mint, cilantro, oregano, tarragon and parsley. If you can ever find huacatay, add a handful to the other herbs as today\u2019s Peruvians do. This delicious sauce may be spooned over eggs, grilled or roasted meats, and even grilled vegetables. I even love it on boiled potatoes. It lasts well in the refrigerator for 3 days. Extra sauce may be frozen for a month.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Madhur Jaffrey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/18/dining/18POTREX2/merlin_133518240_f147bec4-6f44-4244-98d7-b37f39db6c7b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cilantro, parsley, peanut butter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 19}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 162, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "328 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 loosely packed cup flat-leaf parsley leaves", "2 loosely packed cups cilantro leaves", "1/4 cup loosely packed fresh oregano leaves", "1 loosely packed cup fresh mint leaves", "2 tablespoons fresh tarragon leaves", "2 tablespoons lime juice plus a little more, if needed", "2 to 3 fresh, hot green chiles, chopped (See Note)", "1/4 cup chopped feta cheese", "2 tablespoons peanut butter, preferably organic and freshly made", "1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the parsley, cilantro, oregano, mint and tarragon in deep water.
