{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Burned Toast Soup", "description": "The cookbook author Jennifer McLagan developed this recipe for a simple toast soup, a rustic dish that stretches leftover bread into a comforting meal, after tasting an upscale version of it at a restaurant in Paris. She includes it in her 2014 cookbook, \"Bitter: A Taste of the World's Most Dangerous Flavor.\" The recipe requires thorough and severe toasting: The bread should turn black along its edges and deep brown all over. Use thickly sliced bread, so it's not carbonized all the way through, and the ratio of burned bread to deeply toasted bread will work in your favor. Once the bread soaks up the bacon-infused stock and is blitzed with milk and mustard, all of its intense, smoky flavor will mellow.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/04/dining/25JPBURNER8/25JPBURNER8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bacon, bread, milk, sherry vinegar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 237}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 345, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "593 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 ounces bacon, chopped", "2 cups chicken stock", "5 1/2 ounces sourdough bread, or about 3 thick slices", "1 cup milk", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "4 tablespoons butter", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small stockpot or Dutch oven, cook bacon over low to medium heat until cooked through but not crisp.
