{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken Chilaquiles", "description": "Chilaquiles are a traditional Mexican breakfast dish of fried corn tortillas simmered in a red (roja) or green (verde) sauce and often topped with cheese and fried eggs. The green sauce features tomatillos, while the red version uses tomatoes. Here, the quick salsa roja gets a flavor boost from charring the components under a broiler, resulting in a sauce that is pleasantly spicy, bright and smoky. While this dish is usually made in a skillet, this version is cooked on a sheet pan, making it a breeze to feed four people in just one batch. Guajillo chiles have medium heat and an earthy sweetness; for a milder sauce, New Mexico chiles are an excellent choice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/08/dining/kc-sheet-pan-chicken-chilaquiles/merlin_195006765_18396eb0-d008-475a-a0ec-1ed9a3267028-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 Servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, guajillo chiles, sheet-pan, tomato, tortilla chips", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 946}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 Roma tomatoes (1 1/2 pounds), quartered", "1 small yellow onion, quartered", "3 garlic cloves, peeled and halved lengthwise", "1 jalape\u00f1o, stemmed and halved lengthwise", "1 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "5 dried Guajillo chile peppers (1 ounce), stemmed, seeded and torn into large pieces", "1/4 cup safflower or canola oil", "2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "8 ounces corn tortilla chips", "4 cups shredded rotisserie chicken (from 1 whole chicken)", "Finely chopped white onion, sliced radishes, chopped avocado, crumbled queso fresco, sour cream, chopped cilantro and pickled jalape\u00f1os, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack 6 inches from the broiler heat source and heat to high.
