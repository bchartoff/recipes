Halibut is a mild yet buttery and rich fish with firm, meaty flesh. Here, the fish is wrapped in seaweed, which imparts subtle sea flavor and keeps the fish tender and juicy while it roasts. Mussels are steamed open in a bath of clam juice and kelp broth, releasing their flavorful juices into the liquid, which becomes a silky sauce. Earthy saffron adds depth and beautiful color, and just enough butter and cream round out the sauce without making it too heavy. For a festive presentation, top the fish with vibrant salmon roe, which look like jewels and offer pops of brininess.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/14/dining/KC-roasted-halibut-mussel-butter-sauce/merlin_198975507_0ce13aaf-8285-4fb1-9db6-d41cd4e0caa9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood, main course", "keywords": "butter, clam juice, halibut, mussels, saffron, christmas, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 234}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces dried kelp (dashima or kombu; see Tip)", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing", "1 (2 1/2-pound) skinless halibut or cod fillet (1-inch thick; see Tip)", "Kosher salt", "1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice", "3 dozen mussels, cleaned (about 2 pounds)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon saffron, crumbled", "2 small shallots, finely chopped", "1 garlic clove, crushed", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "6 tablespoons heavy cream", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley, plus more for garnish", "1 tablespoon chopped tarragon, plus small leaves for garnish\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
