{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon With Sesame and Herbs", "description": "The easy-to-memorize marinade for this fast broiled salmon hits all the right notes: salty, sweet and sour. The fish emerges from the oven with caramelized, crisp skin, which contrasts nicely with a salad of fresh parsley or cilantro (or both), tossed with sesame oil and rice wine vinegar. Close contact with the intense heat will help crisp up the skin, while keeping the rest of the fish tender and flaky. To avoid overcooking the salmon, be sure to buy fillets that are at least 1 inch thick, and keep an eye on the fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/02/dining/salmon-sesame-herbs/salmon-sesame-herbs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, weeknight, seafood", "keywords": "cilantro, parsley, salmon, sesame oil, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1274}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 410, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "553 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "3 tablespoons light brown sugar or honey", "4 tablespoons unseasoned rice wine vinegar", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper", "4 skin-on salmon fillets, 4 to 6 ounces each, at least 1-inch thick", "2 tablespoons raw white sesame seeds", "1 small shallot, thinly sliced into rings", "3 cups cilantro, parsley or both, tender leaves and stems", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine soy sauce, light brown sugar and 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar in a wide, shallow bowl (or small baking dish) and season with salt and plenty of black pepper.
