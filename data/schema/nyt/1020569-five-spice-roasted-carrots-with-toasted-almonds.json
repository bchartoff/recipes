{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Five-Spice Roasted Carrots With Toasted Almonds", "description": "A complex combination of fennel seeds, anise, clove, cinnamon and Szechuan peppercorns, five-spice powder is a crucial ingredient in the Chinese pantry that also happens to be deeply versatile. It can be used as a dry rub for roast chicken, tossed with saut\u00e9ed vegetables or sprinkled over toasted nuts. Here, five-spice powder, along with a bright splash of vinegar and ginger, dresses up simple roasted carrots. Preheating your baking sheet in the oven will help caramelize and crisp your vegetables, and will also speed up cooking time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/01/dining/sl-roasted-carrots-with-five-spice/merlin_163577592_55f89804-9055-47dd-808b-5ecc311eacb8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, vegetables", "keywords": "almond, carrot, ginger, fall, spring, winter, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 191}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon five-spice powder", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "Kosher salt", "2 bunches carrots (about 2 pounds), trimmed and scrubbed, halved lengthwise if large", "1/4 cup unsalted, raw almonds", "1/4 cup sliced chives (about 1 small bunch)", "1 to 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange one oven rack at the top and one at the bottom of the oven.
