Simmer the peas with charred onion, chile de \u00e1rbol and cloves, and they\u2019ll soak up deep flavor. This recipe comes from the chef Mashama Bailey, of the restaurant Grey in Savannah, Ga., who makes it for her New Year's feast. Her family always cooked the beans with ham hocks, but Ms. Bailey prefers to make hers vegan, so all can enjoy it. These peas are also fairly customizable: Pur\u00e9e a portion of the mixture for a thicker sauce, doctor with your favorite hot sauce or dollop with sour cream to add richness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brigid Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/26/dining/26peas2/merlin_147983442_3e772baa-865a-4797-bea6-7d462fe20b91-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "beans, side dish", "keywords": "black-eyed peas, chiles de \u00e1rbol, cloves, hot sauce, fall, winter, gluten-free, high fiber, vegan, vegetarian, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 910}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds dried black-eyed peas", "1 sweet onion, such as Vidalia, peeled and halved through the root end (keep the root attached)", "4 whole cloves", "1 garlic head, cut in half", "10 black peppercorns", "2 dried bay leaves", "1 chile de \u00e1rbol or other small dried chile", "1 cup olive oil", "2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "Hot sauce, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the peas in a large bowl, add water to cover by 2 inches, and soak overnight."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Blacken the onion: If you have a gas stove, turn one burner on high and place the onion halves directly on the grates next to the flame and cook, turning occasionally, until the onion is charred on all sides, about 5 minutes.
