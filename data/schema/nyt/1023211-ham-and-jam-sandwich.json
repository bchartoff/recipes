{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ham and Jam Sandwich", "description": "Nothing can compare to jambon-beurre, the iconic Parisian sandwich, which is really just a baguette with salted European butter and unsmoked ham. This rendition expands on that perfect trinity with a few additional pantry ingredients: Jam plays well with ham (like in a Monte Cristo), and Dijon and black pepper bring spice and spirit. Smoked ham adds yet another layer of savoriness, but any thinly sliced ham will work. The result is a hearty, complex but still delicate meal, appetizer or pick-me-up. While ham and jam sandwich doesn\u2019t roll off the tongue quite like jambon-beurre, you have permission to call it a ham-jam-sam, if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/31/dining/31hamjamsam/merlin_205954479_cb10fabb-4671-4f8f-8d49-a49b78bad9b8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, snack, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "baguette, ham, jam", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 560}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 baguette (about 20 to 24 inches long)", "4 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter, at room temperature", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1/3 cup fruit jam or preserves, such as cherry, peach or orange", "8 ounces sliced ham, preferably smoked or Black Forest", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the baguette into four equal pieces by cutting the baguette in half crosswise, then cutting each half in half.
