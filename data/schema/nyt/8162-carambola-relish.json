Remove the lids and bands once they are hot. Allow the jars to remain in the hot water until needed. In a medium saucepan, bring the relish to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Pack into hot jars, and cap with bands and lids. Place the jars into the simmering water bath that had sterilized the empty jars. Simmer the packed jars for 15 minutes, remove, and allow to cool. Serve the relish over cream cheese with crackers, or with lamb, roast beef or ham."}]}
