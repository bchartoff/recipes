{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peanut Butter No-Bake Bars", "description": "These bars are perfect for when you\u2019re craving a peanut butter cup, but can\u2019t quite get to them. Inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018639-peanut-butter-balls\">buckeyes</a>, they have that same fudgy-salty-sweet vibe, but with a layer of caramelized flavor from letting the butter turn golden brown after it melted. You can make these treats in just about any size pan, even a mini muffin tin for that true peanut butter cup feel. Cut them into bars or squares with a knife, or use cookie cutters to make cute shapes if you need a project for the kids. Or even the adults, because that sort of thing never gets old.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/29/dining/mc-pbbars/mc-pbbars-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 (8-by-8-inch) pan", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "birthday, valentine\u2019s day, chocolate, cookie crumbs, peanut butter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 541}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons butter", "1 cup peanut butter (smooth or crunchy), or use another nut butter", "Pinch of kosher salt (optional)", "1/2 cup cookie crumbs, such as graham crackers or gingersnaps, or use almond flour, coconut flour or shredded coconut", "About 1 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar", "6 ounces chocolate chips or chopped chocolate, any percentage (1 cup)", "1/2 tablespoon coconut oil or butter", "Flaky sea salt, shredded coconut, sliced almonds, chopped honey-roasted peanuts, or crushed pretzels, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the base: Heat butter in a pot or skillet, letting it melt and bubble and turn brown.
