The soup, served during the festivities leading up to Nowruz, the Persian New Year, wouldn\u2019t be the same without the soup noodles called reshteh, which are saltier and starchier than Italian noodles \u2014 though you could substitute linguine in a pinch. Kashk, a form of drained yogurt or whey, is saltier and more sour than Greek yogurt or sour cream. More like feta than yogurt, liquid kashk gives ash its distinct, satisfying flavor. If you can\u2019t find liquid kashk, buy it powdered and hydrate it with warm water to the consistency of sour cream. Look for both items at a Middle Eastern grocery.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/14Iranianrex2/merlin_154113918_721ff786-e3ef-453f-b3a0-deec1d8f8e02-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings (about 4 quarts)", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, noodles, soups and stews", "keywords": "chickpea, herbs, lentils, spinach, white beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 165}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup dried chickpeas", "1/4 cup dried white beans, such as navy or cannellini", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 pounds spinach", "1 pound cilantro (about 3 large bunches)", "1 pound Italian parsley (about 3 large bunches)", "2 large bunches dill", "1 large bunch chives", "About 20 large fresh mint leaves", "6 tablespoons plus 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large yellow onions, 1 finely chopped and 1 thinly sliced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 cup dried green or brown lentils", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 quarts chicken or beef stock (preferably homemade), or water", "1 1/2 cups liquid kashk (Persian sun-dried yogurt or whey), plus 1/2 cup, for serving", "8 ounces reshteh (Persian soup noodles)", "1 tablespoon dried mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The night before you plan to cook, place chickpeas and white beans in a medium bowl.
