{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry-Orange Scones", "description": "Cranberries and orange are a classic sweet-tart pairing in these scones, which are quick-to-make but super satisfying. Folding the dough a few times, and using a combination of buttermilk and cream creates a flaky and tender texture that is irresistible. The glaze adds another punch of orange flavor, but it is totally optional, if you prefer a simpler scone. The scones freeze well after baking, but for the best texture, make sure to defrost them at room temperature and warm gently before serving. Feel free to swap in another citrus fruit for the orange, and just about any other dried fruit for the cranberries. Tart cherries and lime also make a great combination.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/06/dining/ya-cranberry-orange-scones-rex/merlin_213671157_70514fad-8f42-4371-9a8f-4a2410342166-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "9 scones", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, quick, snack, dessert", "keywords": "buttermilk, dried cranberry, freezer friendly, orange, scone, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 624}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium orange", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "2 1/4 cups/288 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes", "1 cup/130 grams dried cranberries, roughly chopped", "1/2 cup/115 grams buttermilk, cold", "1/2 cup/115 grams heavy cream, cold, plus more to brush over the scones", "1 cup/100 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "4 to 6 teaspoons orange juice", "Pinch salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Zest the orange into a large bowl.
