{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Spiced Cauliflower Steaks", "description": "This recipe, developed by 19-year-old Ella Heckert and her mother, the chef Kelsie Kerr, yields crisp cauliflower steaks with a golden crust so tender that they shatter upon first bite. Made with brown rice and tapioca flour, the incidentally gluten-free batter is delicate but unfussy. This version is spiked with fresh turmeric and garam masala spices, but consider it a blank slate and feel free to experiment with other spice combinations, too. At Kerr\u2019s Berkeley restaurant, Standard Fare, the batter is used throughout the year to coat all sorts of other ingredients, including winter squash, eggplant and even housemade paneer, which is a perennial favorite. Try the dish with cauliflower, then make it your own \u2014 you\u2019ll be surprised how long the crust remains crisp!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/magazine/14mag-eat-slideshow-slide-2DW5/14mag-eat-slideshow-slide-2DW5-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, finger foods, vegetables", "keywords": "cauliflower, cayenne pepper, cinnamon stick, coconut oil, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 570}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1174, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "97 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "83 grams", "sodiumContent": "980 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 of 1 cinnamon stick, broken up", "2 teaspoons coriander seeds", "2 teaspoons fennel seeds", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "4 cloves", "Large pinch of ground cayenne", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus additional, as needed", "1 1/3 cups brown- or white-rice flour (about 7 1/3 ounces)", "2/3 cup tapioca flour (about 3 2/3 ounces)", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (from 2 limes)", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 1 large lemon), plus additional lemon wedges, for serving", "1 tablespoon grated fresh turmeric (or 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric)", "2 small heads cauliflower (about 1 pound each), leaves removed, cut from top to core into 1/2-inch-thick slices", "1 1/2 to 2 cups coconut oil", "1 cup Greek yogurt, for serving (optional)", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a baking sheet with a wire rack or paper towels, and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Finely grind cinnamon, coriander, fennel, peppercorns, cumin and cloves in a spice grinder, spice mill or mortar and pestle.Transfer to a bowl, and stir in cayenne and 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons salt.
