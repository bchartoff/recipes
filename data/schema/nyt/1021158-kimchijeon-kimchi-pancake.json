Kim\u2019s golden kimchijeon are a revelation. Tart with pungent kimchi, the pancakes are both satisfyingly chewy and shatteringly crisp. At the Tofu House, where Mrs. Kim turns 1,400 pounds of Napa cabbage into kimchi each month, her homemade kimchi is the secret to her kimchijeon\u2019s unsurpassed flavor. Use the most flavorful traditionally prepared kimchi you can find \u2014 it\u2019ll make all the difference in this simple recipe. This version, adapted from Mrs. Kim\u2019s original recipe, comes together quickly: Just combine kimchi and its juice with a few dry ingredients into a simple batter, then fry it in a cast-iron skillet into a mouth-watering pancake. Serve it to a crowd as an appetizer, or eat it on its own as a filling meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/21/magazine/14mag-eat/14mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 (10-inch) pancakes", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, finger foods, pancakes, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "gochujang, kimchi, ponzu, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 843}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup citrus ponzu sauce", "1 tablespoon toasted white sesame seeds", "1 scallion, thinly sliced", "1/2 cup potato starch", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "Pinch of sea salt", "1 heaping cup kimchi (about 10 ounces), plus 1/4 cup kimchi juice", "2 scallions, chopped", "2 tablespoons gochujang", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon fish sauce", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dipping sauce: In a small bowl, combine ponzu sauce, sesame seeds and scallion.
