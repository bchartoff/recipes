Pressure cookers are ideal for preparing dried beans; even unsoaked beans cook quickly and evenly, so that the beans become creamy but still keep their shape (though we\u2019ve got instructions for a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020816-vegan-slow-cooker-red-beans-and-rice\">slow cooker approach</a>, too). Here, you want the beans to be very tender, so that the stew is thick \u2014 with a few beans that have slightly broken down \u2014 and not soupy. This vegan version of \u201cMonday red beans\u201d is not as creamy as the one made with pork, so smashing a few beans against the side of the pot at the end of cooking is particularly important. Louisiana-style hot sauce is key as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/22/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-vegan-red-beans-and-rice/sd-pressure-cooker-vegan-red-beans-and-rice-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "beans, sausages", "keywords": "bay leaves, bell pepper, celery, garlic, kidney bean, miso, onion, smoked paprika, soy milk, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 22}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 celery stalks, finely chopped", "1 green bell pepper, finely chopped", "10 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 heaping tablespoon white or yellow miso paste", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cayenne, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground sage (optional)", "1 pound dried red kidney beans (no need to soak)", "3 dried bay leaves", "3 fresh thyme sprigs or 1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "Cooked rice, for serving", "Sliced scallions, for serving", "Louisiana-style hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn on the saut\u00e9 setting of a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker and heat the oil.
