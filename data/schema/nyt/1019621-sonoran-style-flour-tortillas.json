{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sonoran-Style Flour Tortillas", "description": "In Sonora, a Northern Mexican region where wheat has been cultivated for more than 400 years, tortillas are typically made of flour rather than corn. But unlike the generally lackluster store-bought wrappers most Americans are familiar with, handmade flour tortillas are pliable, chewy, fragrant, and dotted with mahogany blisters.\n\nWhile this recipe, adapted from Teo Diaz and Julia Guerrero of Sonoratown taqueria in downtown Los Angeles, isn\u2019t complicated, it does require allowing some time for the dough to rest. But the investment is worth it. Once you roll out the tortillas and set them on the hot griddle, they\u2019ll begin to puff with steam as they start to brown. When you take a bite, the aroma of sweet flour enveloped in fat will fill your nose and mouth. Finally, you\u2019ll understand that a tortilla is meant to be an essential component rather than just monotextured wrapping paper for tacos, burritos, or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019638-chivichangas-de-machaca-stewed-brisket-and-cheese-chivichangas\">chimichangas</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/07/magazine/07mag-eat-image1/07mag-eat-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "12 tortillas", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "lunch, snack, breads, project", "keywords": "flour, kosher salt, lard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 316}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 140, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "116 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 heaping cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "Scant 1/2 cup (3 ounces) lard, melted", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (5 ounces) hot tap water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together flour, salt and baking powder.
