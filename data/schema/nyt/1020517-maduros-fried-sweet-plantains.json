{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maduros (Fried Sweet Plantains)", "description": "Tender in the middle and crisp at the edges, maduros, or sweet fried plantains, are served as a side dish throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Plantains change color as they ripen: They are firm when green and unripe, then soften as they turn yellow, and eventually, black. Like bananas, plantains develop more sugar as time passes. For the sweetest maduros, use blackened plantains \u2014 they have the most sugar, and will yield a more caramelized result. If you can only find yellow ones at the store, buy them in advance and be prepared to wait over a week for them to fully ripen. They\u2019re worth it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kiera Wright-Ruiz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/dining/kwr-maduros/kwr-maduros-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean, latin american", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, plantain", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 49}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 very ripe, blackened plantains (about 6 ounces each)", "Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use a paring knife to cut a slit along the length of the plantains, carefully avoiding cutting into the flesh.
