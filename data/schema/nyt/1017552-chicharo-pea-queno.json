{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ch\u00edcharo Pea-que\u00f1o", "description": "Dawn Kinstle, a bartender at Lot 2 in Brooklyn, devised this punningly-named cocktail, in which juice from the pods of English peas is combined with tequila, mint, lime and just a touch of salt to bright, refreshing and gorgeously green effect. Making the pea-pod juice is simpler than it sounds, though it does require the use of an extraction juicer: you just juice the pods and then strain the liquid. Kinstle favors just four or five grains of gray sea salt to finish the drink.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/19/magazine/19drink3/19drink3-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 cocktail", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "lime, pea-pod juice, tequila", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 oz. tequila", "3/4 oz. lime juice", "3/4 oz.
