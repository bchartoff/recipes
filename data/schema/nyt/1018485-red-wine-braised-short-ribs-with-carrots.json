{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red Wine-Braised Short Ribs With Carrots", "description": "Everyone loves beef short ribs. Because the meat is well-marbled, a couple of hours\u2019 slow cooking keeps it incredibly succulent. This homely combination of beef with carrot, cooked rather plainly, is classic in traditional French cooking, and produces truly delicious results. Like all other braises, this one improves if made a day (or two) in advance of serving, though you can certainly make it all in one go if you wish. Cooking it ahead accomplishes a number of things, not least of which is that it needs only reheating to serve. Another is that refrigerating the braise in its juices always seems to intensify the flavors. Yet one more reason: It is easier to remove the fat on the surface of the liquid when it is cold, rather than trying to skim it from the surface hot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/21/dining/21KITCHEN/21KITCHEN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "carrot, leek, red wine, short ribs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 459}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 pounds meaty beef short ribs, cut flanken- or English-style", "Salt and pepper", "Olive oil", "1 large onion, peeled and halved", "2 whole cloves", "2 bay leaves", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 cups dry red wine", "4 cups beef or chicken broth, heated", "2 pounds small carrots, peeled and cut in 2- or 3-inch lengths of roughly equal thickness", "1 medium leek, white and tender green parts, cut in 1-inch dice (about 2 cups)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon potato starch or cornstarch, dissolved in 2 tablespoons cold water (optional)", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley, for serving", "2 tablespoons finely cut chives, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season each rib generously all over with salt and pepper.
