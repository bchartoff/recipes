{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "West Indian Lamb Curry", "description": "Curried goat is a popular dish in the West Indies, but lamb makes a fine substitute here in the United States, where goat meat is hard to find. This version, by the chef Martin Maginley from the Round Hill resort in Jamaica, is deeply flavored with allspice and Scotch bonnet peppers, but not overwhelming spicy. If you have time to make it the day before, it gets better as it sits, and gives you a chance to scoop some of the fat off the top of the stew before reheating over a low flame. And if you can procure goat, use it here in place of the lamb.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/13/multimedia/clark-lamb-curry/clark-lamb-curry-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, curries", "keywords": "allspice, curry, lamb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 452}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 330, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "580 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds boneless lamb (or goat) stew meat, cut into 2-inch chunks", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons curry powder", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 large white onion, coarsely chopped", "2 scallions, coarsely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1/2 inch fresh ginger, peeled if desired and coarsely chopped", "4 whole allspice berries", "2 thyme sprigs, leaves stripped", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1 1/2 cups diced potato", "1 cup diced carrots", "1 to 2 small Scotch bonnet peppers, seeded and chopped", "Cooked white rice or coconut rice, for serving (see note)", "Lime wedges, for serving", "Mango chutney or mango pickle, for serving", "Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat lamb dry with paper towels and place in a large bowl.
