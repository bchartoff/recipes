The soup sometimes includes mandu, as it does here, and those dumplings also can be frozen. An aromatic gochugaru oil turns this ordinarily snow-white dish crimson, flavoring the bold, spicy-sweet kimchi dumpling filling and tingeing the final broth with its heat. The tteok, rice cakes, here come in the form of thick, cylindrical pieces rather than soggy coins, and are added at the last moment to maintain their pleasurable chewiness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/27/multimedia/01EAT-kimchi-tteok-mandu-guk-1-4cc2/01EAT-kimchi-tteok-mandu-guk-1-4cc2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, dumplings, project, main course", "keywords": "brisket, egg yolks, gochugaru, ground beef, kimchi, radish, soup, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 49}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound brisket", "1 pound Korean radish, peeled and cut crosswise into 2-inch-thick slabs", "1 large yellow onion, peeled with the root end left intact", "1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt", "1/2 cup olive oil", "2 tablespoons coarse gochugaru (see Tip)", "1 small yellow onion, finely grated", "4 ounces drained napa cabbage kimchi, finely chopped (1/2 packed cup)", "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "1 large egg", "Coarse kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 pound ground beef (preferably 80/20)", "48 (3-inch) store-bought round dumpling wrappers (from one 1-pound package)", "Olive oil", "4 large egg yolks", "8 ounces fresh or thawed frozen tteok (cylindrical Korean rice cakes), chopped into bite-size pieces", "1 (5-gram) packet gim (roasted seaweed), scissored into thin strips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the broth: Soak the brisket in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes.
