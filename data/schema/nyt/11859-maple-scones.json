It\u2019s more of a traditional scone, not cakey and soft, but crumbly and robust \u2014 strong enough to stand up to a slathering of Irish butter. They\u2019re best served warm, on a fall morning, alongside a cup of tea or a strong cup of coffee.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Guerrero"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/dining/28COOKING-MAPLESCONES/28COOKING-MAPLESCONES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "flour, maple syrup, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 477}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "179 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup whole-wheat flour", "1 cup white flour, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons packed brown sugar", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/4 pound chilled butter (1 stick)", "1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts or cooked wheat berries", "1/3 cup maple syrup", "1 large egg", "2 tablespoons milk, or as needed", "Vegetable oil or nonstick spray for greasing baking sheet"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
