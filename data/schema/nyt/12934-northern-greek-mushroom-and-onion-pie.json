Brush a 10- or 12-inch tart pan or cake pan with olive oil and layer in 7 sheets of phyllo dough, placing them not quite evenly on top of one another so that the edges overlap the sides of the pan all the way around. Brush each sheet with olive oil (or a mixture of olive oil and melted butter) before adding the next sheet. Fill with the mushroom and onion mixture. Bring the overhanging edges of the phyllo in over the filling, brushing each sheet with more olive oil, then layer 5 more sheets of dough over the top, brushing each sheet with olive oil. Crimp the edges into the sides of the pan. Pierce the top of the pie in several places with a sharp knife. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature. Recrisp the crust, if necessary, in a low oven for 10 to 20 minutes"}]}
