The burgers have a decidedly Mediterranean flavor, with feta and mint included in the mix. But I still like to serve them with raita or chutney; a more Mediterranean condiment would be yogurt seasoned with pur\u00e9ed garlic and mint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/31/science/31cooking/16recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 patties", "recipeCuisine": "american, indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers", "keywords": "fall, spring, winter, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 591}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 275, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "462 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup quinoa (blond or black), rinsed", "1/3 cup red lentils, rinsed", "1 2/3 cups water", "Salt to taste", "1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, baked", "3 cups, tightly packed, chopped fresh spinach", "3 ounces feta, crumbled (about 3/4 cup)", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint", "1/4 cup minced chives", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 cup panko or chickpea flour (you will not use all of it)", "1/4 cup grape seed oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine quinoa, red lentils, water and salt to taste (I used a rounded 1/2 teaspoon) in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
