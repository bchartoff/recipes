{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Key Lime Poundcake", "description": "Susan Levin Turner has taught many Southerners, both professional chefs and home cooks, how to bake a proper cake. She has made cakes for politicians and celebrities, and turned out five when the chef Edna Lewis turned 76. \u201cCakes bring people together for celebrations and funerals and everything in between,\u201d she said. Ms. Turner, who owns Food Glorious Food in Tallahassee, Fla., developed this recipe to combine Key limes, a flavor associated with South Florida, with poundcake, a staple in the more rural, agricultural parts of North Florida. She bakes hers in an old-fashioned large square poundcake pan, but the recipe has been adapted here for a loaf pan, which is a little easier to find and work with. She likes to coat the inside of the greased cake pan with sugar, which helps the cake slide from the pan and offers a little more crispness to the crust. This recipe uses flour instead for tenderness, but the sugar method offers a homey Southern touch. Or use a combination of both.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/25/dining/25COOKING-KEYLIMEPOUNDCAKE/25COOKING-KEYLIMEPOUNDCAKE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cream cheese, Key lime juice, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 255}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 599, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "73 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "166 milligrams", "sugarContent": "53 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/226 grams unsalted butter at room temperature, cut into pieces, plus more for greasing the pan \u00a0", "2 cups/240 grams all-purpose flour, more for flouring the pan", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "4 ounces/113 grams cream cheese at room temperature, cut into pieces", "1 1/2 cups/297 grams granulated white sugar", "4 eggs at room temperature, lightly beaten", "2 tablespoons lime zest", "1 tablespoon Key lime juice", "4 ounces/113 grams cream cheese at room temperature", "1/4 cup/57 grams unsalted butter at room temperature", "2 cups/227 grams confectioners' sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters Key lime juice", "2 tablespoons lime zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat oven to 325 degrees.
