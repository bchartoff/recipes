What could be better than a giant chocolate chip pizza cookie? If your answer is, \u201cpretty much nothing,\u201d we\u2019d say you\u2019re 100% right. This Instagram-worthy treat starts with a batch of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015819-chocolate-chip-cookies\">our famous chocolate chip cookie dough</a> (with a smidge of cornstarch to keep the cookie soft and gooey in the center), but from there, it\u2019s all yours. When we took it out of the oven, we spread on cherry jam \u201cpizza sauce,\u201d drizzled on melted white chocolate \u201cmozzarella,\u201d and added rounds of raspberry fruit leather \u201cpepperoni.\u201d But warmed Nutella and blobs of marshmallow fluff are a pretty awesome combination, too. We developed this recipe for a special print-only edition of The New York Times for Kids, but our sources tell us grown-up sweet tooths can't resist this oversized treat either. For a more sophisticated dinner party-worthy variation, leave off the toppings and serve generous wedges with scoops of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017613-easiest-vanilla-ice-cream\">vanilla ice cream</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017749-bobby-flays-salted-caramel-sauce \">salted caramel sauce</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/11/dining/11Cookiepizza/11Cookiepizza-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 10-inch cookies or 1 sheet-pan pizza cookie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 217}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 329, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "169 milligrams", "sugarContent": "43 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 2/3 cups minus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "3 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda", "1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt", "2 1/2 sticks (1 1/4 cups) unsalted butter, softened", "1 1/4 cups (10 ounces) light brown sugar", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (8 ounces) granulated sugar", "2 large eggs", "2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract", "1 pound bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
