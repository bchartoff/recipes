{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Drop Biscuits", "description": "Somewhat of a cross between a muffin top and a biscuit, these sweet breakfast treats are foolproof and easy: No rolling or cutting is required, and everything is mixed in a single bowl. They bake up craggy and crunchy on the outside, but are tender once you break them open. The heavy cream adds richness, and the additional water creates just the right amount of steam while baking to keep the biscuits light and fluffy. Salted butter works nicely here, but if you\u2019re using unsalted butter, just add 1/4 teaspoon or so of fine salt to the dry ingredients. If you don\u2019t have strawberries, feel free to swap in the same amount of fresh blueberries, raspberries or diced stone fruit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/15/dining/jg-strawberry-biscuits/merlin_173545854_5ce343dc-28e8-43ce-8b32-86cb99c9b9fc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 biscuits", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack", "keywords": "biscuit, butter, confectioners' sugar, flour, heavy cream, strawberries", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1358}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "4 teaspoons baking powder", "6 tablespoons/85 grams cold salted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "4 medium strawberries, cut into small 1/4-inch or 1/2-inch pieces (about 2/3 cup/100 grams), or whole blueberries, raspberries or other diced stone fruit", "6 tablespoons heavy cream, plus more if needed", "1/4 cup/30 grams unsifted confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven.
