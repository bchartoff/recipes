{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cornbread", "description": "This basic recipe is so easy and forgiving that you may find yourself making cornbread as often as your mother made mashed potatoes. Only a few ingredients are pretty much fixed: the salt, the baking powder, cornmeal and flour (you want a little flour for lightness). Other than that, feel free to experiment with bits of cooked bacon, saut\u00e9ed onions or shallots, chili powder or cumin, chopped chilies or herbs, grated cheese, mashed or pur\u00e9ed beans or fresh, canned or frozen corn. The options are practically endless.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/26/dining/26COOKING_CORNBREAD/26COOKING_CORNBREAD-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, butter, cornmeal, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 937}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "241 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons butter, olive oil, lard or bacon drippings", "1 1/2 cups medium-grind cornmeal", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/4 to 1/2 cup sugar", "2 eggs", "1 1/4 cups milk, more if needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
