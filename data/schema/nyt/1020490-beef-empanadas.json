{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef Empanadas", "description": "Filipinos take snacking seriously, so much so that we devote an entire meal to it: merienda, which may take place midmorning or midafternoon, if not both. Empanadas are a great treat for this in-between time, but also keep well at room temperature \u2014 the grace of food built for a warm climate \u2014 so you can graze all day. (My family used to buy these by the tray for parties, but it\u2019s nice to make your own and store them in the freezer for later.) In these, a ground-beef filling is tucked inside sturdy but flaky dough, with raisins added early in the cooking to plump with the beef juices. There are variations on empanadas all over Latin America; ours rely on the potency of onion and garlic, and exploit it to the hilt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Angela Dimayuga"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/08Filipinorex10-empanada/merlin_160617843_14011642-342a-4f0e-93d5-4c962d75621c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "40 empanadas", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, finger foods, meat, pastries, project", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bell pepper, ground beef, oyster sauce, russet potatoes, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 eggs", "1/4 cup milk", "1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 1/2 cups/575 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), diced", "2 tablespoons white vinegar", "2/3 cup ice water", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 small yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)", "1/2 large green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "1/2 large red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "3 garlic cloves, finely minced", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper", "1/2 medium russet potato, peeled and cut into 1-centimeter cubes (about 1/2 cup)", "1/4 cup raisins", "3/4 pound ground beef", "1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon oyster sauce", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1/2 cup chicken stock", "1 (48-ounce) bottle neutral oil, such as canola, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the empanada dough: In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the milk and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Working with one log at a time, remove dough from fridge. Cut each log in half crosswise, then cut each half crosswise into 10 equal pieces, which will be the shape of thick coins. Using a bit of flour, dust your work surface. Round each coin slightly using your thumb and forefinger and on your surface with your hands press each coin lightly to coax it into a flat round shape. Switch to a rolling pin and roll each piece of empanada dough into a 4 1/2-inch circle. You can lightly dust and stack your circles off to the side or transfer them to a parchment lined baking sheet and chill until you are ready to assemble (they are easier to work with when kept cool). Repeat with remaining log. When you have all your pieces rolled out, you are ready to assemble your empanadas. Place about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the meat filling in the center of each circle, leaving at least a 1/2-inch border. Using a brush or your finger, wet the edges of the dough with water and fold the crust over the filling, forming half-moon empanada shapes, sealing out as much air as possible. Crimp the edges of the empanada with the tines of a fork to seal."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large heavy Dutch oven or pot, heat about 2 inches of oil over medium-high. Heat oil to 365 degrees. Working in batches so as not to crowd the pan, maintaining an even heat, fry the empanadas, turning frequently, until they start to bob, 4 to 5 minutes. (They should be crisp and golden brown, the pastry should be cooked through and the meat should be warmed through.) Transfer to a paper-towel lined baking sheet and fry remaining empanadas. Serve warm."}]}
