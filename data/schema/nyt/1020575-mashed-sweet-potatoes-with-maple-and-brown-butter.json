{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mashed Sweet Potatoes With Maple and Brown Butter", "description": "This recipe is a grown-up take on sweet potatoes with brown sugar and marshmallows. A generous swirl of browned butter and maple syrup give the potatoes an earthy sweetness and great depth of flavor, while salted, toasted pecans sprinkled on top add a savory crunch. To save time on Thanksgiving, toast the pecans and make the brown butter up to a day in advance. Simply store the pecans in an airtight container, and the brown butter in the refrigerator. (Gently melt the butter in the microwave before using.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/dining/lh-mashed-sweet-potatoes/merlin_163577667_e1b268ed-1f3c-4a33-80d6-f158bd3c25c7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, winter, maple syrup, pecan, sweet potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 30}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes", "3/4 cup raw pecans (optional)", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "10 tablespoons unsalted butter (1\u00bc sticks)", "1/2 cup whole milk", "3 tablespoons maple syrup, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
