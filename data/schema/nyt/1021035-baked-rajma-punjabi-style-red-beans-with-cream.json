{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Rajma (Punjabi-Style Red Beans With Cream)", "description": "Punjabi-style rajma, or red beans, in a thick, spicy tomato gravy is comforting, quick and comes together with what you have in the pantry. This one-pan baked version is inspired by it, but deviates from tradition in several ways. First, it lets the oven do the work of reducing the sauce. When the dish comes out, scatter with cilantro, if you\u2019ve got it, and some quick-pickled onion. The key is to take your time with the base, letting the onion mixture cook out properly, so the final sauce is mellow and deeply flavored. But you can try the same technique with different beans, from chickpeas to cannellini. Eating the dish with a side of yogurt or a glug of cream is common, but it\u2019s also a treat with a little melted cheese, the edges browned in the pan. Use what you\u2019ve got. Serve the rajma over rice, ideally, but if you\u2019re in a pinch, a side of hot flour tortillas or even buttered toast will make it into a delicious meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/03/magazine/03-mag-eat/03-mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, one pot, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, cilantro, ginger, kidney bean, onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2266}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 red onion", "4 garlic cloves", "1 fresh green chile", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled", "2 tablespoons neutral oil", "1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon sea salt", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed, diced, chopped or whole tomatoes", "2 (15-ounce) cans kidney beans, drained", "1/2 teaspoon red chile powder", "1/4 teaspoon garam masala", "1/2 cup heavy cream or 1 cup diced mozzarella cheese", "1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup white wine vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
