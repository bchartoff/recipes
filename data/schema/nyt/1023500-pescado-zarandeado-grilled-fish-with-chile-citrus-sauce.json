{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pescado Zarandeado (Grilled Fish With Chile-Citrus Sauce)", "description": "This pre-Hispanic dish comes from Mexcalitl\u00e1n, a small island in the state of Nayarit on the mid-Pacific Coast. Originally, the fish was seasoned with a chile-lime salsa and grilled over a zaranda, a pit made of mangrove wood from which the dish gets its name. But there are many regional variations, using either freshwater and saltwater fish, found along the Pacific Coast as well as inland, in the northern central states.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
