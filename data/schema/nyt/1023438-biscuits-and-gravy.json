{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Biscuits and Gravy", "description": "This is not the traditional way to make biscuits, but it may become your new technique. Instead of preparing individual drop biscuits, a sturdy dough is spread out into a baking dish over a bed of melted butter. Scoring the biscuit dough allows the butter to seep into the sides as the biscuits bake, creating tall biscuits with crisp edges and flaky insides. They\u2019re perfect to soak up a classic Southern gravy, warmly seasoned with sage and nutmeg. This dish tastes like the holidays in the best way possible, while still being light enough for brunch. But if you made it for dinner, we wouldn\u2019t blame you.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/29/dining/mp-biscuits-and-gravy-1/mp-biscuits-and-gravy-1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, lunch, main course", "keywords": "biscuit, buttermilk, greek yogurt, sage, sausage", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 204}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 3/4 cups/340 grams all-purpose flour, sifted", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 \u00bd teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature\u00a0", "1 (5.3-ounce) container full-fat Greek yogurt, at room temperature\u00a0", "1/2 cup/112 grams salted butter, melted, plus more as needed", "12 ounces raw breakfast sausage, casings removed", "1 small yellow onion, finely chopped", "2 large garlic cloves, grated or chopped\u00a0", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 cup unsalted chicken stock", "1 small bay leaf\u00a0", "2 cups whole milk", "1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, preferably freshly cracked\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground sweet paprika", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne, plus more to taste\u00a0", "\u215b teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley\u00a0", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage (from about 8 leaves)", "Salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the biscuits: In a medium bowl, using a wooden spoon, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
