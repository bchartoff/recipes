{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sabzi Polo (Persian Herbed Rice)", "description": "The star of this herb-flecked Persian-style rice recipe, by the actor and food blogger Naz Deravian, is the lavash tahdig \u2014 a crisp, buttery layer of toasted lavash flatbread at the bottom of the pot. Break it into pieces and use it to garnish the platter of rice, making sure everyone gets a piece. The rice itself is highly fragrant, scented with dill, mint and whatever other soft herbs you can get, along with heady saffron. You need to find thin flatbread to make this; the kind used for wraps is a good bet. It will take some time to clean all the herbs, but don't worry about taking off each leaf. Using tender stems and sprigs is perfectly fine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/20/dining/20JPAPPE5/20JPAPPE5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "side dish", "keywords": "basil, basmati rice, fenugreek, herbs, lavash, mint, saffron, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 200}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 425, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "70 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "544 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups white basmati rice", "Kosher salt, as needed", "10 cups packed mixed soft herbs, such as parsley, cilantro, dill, chives, tarragon and ramp greens", "1 1/2 cups packed mint leaves", "1/2 cup packed basil leaves (preferably lemon basil)", "5 stems of fresh fenugreek, leaves only (optional)", "8 tablespoons butter or ghee, more if needed", "1 teaspoon grapeseed or olive oil", "1/4 teaspoon saffron, plus a small pinch, ground with a mortar and pestle", "2 to 4 pieces thin lavash or other flatbread", "2 tablespoons dried dill", "2 stalks spring garlic (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large strainer, rinse the rice until the water runs clear, mixing it with your fingers as you rinse.
