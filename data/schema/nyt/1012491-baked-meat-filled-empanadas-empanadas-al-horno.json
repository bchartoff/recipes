The classic versions are filled with seasoned minced (not ground) meat and onions and garnished with hard-cooked egg, olives and raisins. They can be made either in the half-moon shape that they usually take throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, or in a distinctively Chilean squared-off form made by folding all but the straight side of the semicircular turnover to make a package that is often four inches across. The dough is made with lard.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/09/dining/Empanadas/Empanadas-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 large empanadas", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beef, black olives, raisins, fall, winter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 119}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons lard", "1 cup fine-chopped onion", "1/2 pound lean beef, minced", "Salt", "fresh black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "Tabasco or other hot sauce to taste", "Empanada dough (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012490-empanada-dough\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>)", "2 hard-cooked eggs, sliced", "12 pitted cured black olives, sliced", "30 raisins", "1 large egg, lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt lard in a 10- to 12-inch skillet.
