The dish is eaten across the Caribbean, but this version comes from Hazel Craig, the mother of the pastry chef Jessica Craig of L\u2019Artusi in Manhattan. Hazel makes the dish every Christmas exactly as she ate it in Jamaica: with saltfish, which adds heft and a pleasant funk. If you\u2019re not able to get callaloo (which can be found in fresh or canned form at Caribbean markets and some international grocery stores), any sturdy green will do, like kale or Swiss chard.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/19/dining/19Jamaican-A/merlin_147982794_9c5db5db-fd56-488c-853b-29fa982cff46-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "callaloo, lawry's seasoned salt, saltfish, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 159, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "431 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces saltfish or bacalao (optional)", "1/4 cup vegetable or canola oil", "1 medium white onion, halved and sliced", "1 medium tomato, chopped", "1 pound callaloo or other hearty leafy greens (such as kale or Swiss chard), stems removed and greens roughly chopped", "1/2 teaspoon Lawry\u2019s Seasoned Salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using saltfish, place it in a small pot and cover with water by 1 inch.
