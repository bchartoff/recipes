{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Borani-yeh Karafs (Celery Yogurt Dip)", "description": "Borani is an Iranian yogurt-based dish that highlights one ingredient, typically a vegetable. This one combines crisp celery with Greek yogurt for a cooling snack. Dried mint and dried dill are Iranian pantry staples and are always ready to be used in an array of dishes. Don\u2019t think of them as substitutes for fresh herbs but as stars in their own right. You can use fresh dill, if you prefer, but the dried mint here delivers a unique flavor and fragrance not found in its fresh counterpart. The dried cranberries add texture and color, and balance the celery with a hint of sweetness. Serve this dish as a dip or dig right in with a spoon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/16/dining/nd-celery-yogurt-dip/merlin_192901266_5a6665d6-4540-4929-be86-873be22d1311-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "celery, dried mint, yogurt, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 495}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup roasted, skinned hazelnuts", "1 (16-ounce) container Greek yogurt (2 cups)", "4 large celery stalks (preferably the lighter ones from the hearts), cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 2 cups)", "1 green onion, chopped", "2 tablespoons dried cranberries, coarsely chopped, plus more for garnish", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon dried mint, plus more for garnish", "2 teaspoons dried dill or 1 tablespoon fresh chopped dill, plus more for garnish", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "Chips, flatbreads or crudit\u00e9s, for dipping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Coarsely chop the hazelnuts, set a few pieces aside for garnish and place the rest in a medium bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the yogurt, celery, green onion, dried cranberries, lemon juice, mint, dill and salt to the bowl and mix well.
