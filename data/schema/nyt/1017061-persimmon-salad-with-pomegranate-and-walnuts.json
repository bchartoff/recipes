{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Persimmon Salad with Pomegranate and Walnuts", "description": "Persimmons make a colorful cool weather salad, combined with dark red Treviso and radicchio leaves and glistening ruby-like pomegranate seeds. Walnut oil and shallots give the vinaigrette an earthy flavor, accentuated by caramelized walnuts with sea salt. You need the small apple-size Fuyu persimmons, which are delicious eaten raw. (The pointy Hachiya persimmons need to ripen to softness and are usually cooked for cakes or puddings.) Make this throughout the fall and winter. If persimmons are unavailable use pears, Asian pears or crisp tart apples.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/17/dining/17KITCHEN1/17KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "persimmon, pomegranate, radicchio, walnut, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 158}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 184, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "233 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces walnuts, about 1/2 cup", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel or other coarse sea salt, crumbled", "1 shallot, finely sliced", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "Salt and pepper", "3 tablespoons walnut oil", "3 medium Fuyu persimmons, peeled", "8 ounces radicchio, Treviso or other chicory leaves", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
