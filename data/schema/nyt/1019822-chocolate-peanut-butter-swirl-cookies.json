You only need five ingredients and a bit of elbow grease to put them together. While semisweet chocolate (in bar or chip form) would certainly work here, bittersweet chocolate is a better choice. The darker chocolate, along with the cocoa powder, adds a fruity bitterness that contrasts nicely with the sweet peanut butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/dining/ss-chocolate-peanut-butter-cookies/merlin_147610656_6885932b-c408-49d8-a373-5d429290e67a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, chocolate, peanut butter, dessert, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 841}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 202, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "69 milligrams", "sugarContent": "21 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (16-ounce/455-gram) jar smooth peanut butter (not natural)", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar, plus more for assembling", "3 large eggs", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/85 grams chopped bittersweet chocolate", "3 tablespoons cocoa powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
