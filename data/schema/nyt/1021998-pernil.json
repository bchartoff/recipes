{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pernil", "description": "Perhaps the best known and most coveted dish from Puerto Rico, pernil is a positively sumptuous preparation for pork shoulder. It\u2019s marinated (ideally overnight) in garlic, citrus and herbs, then slow-roasted on high heat to achieve a crisp chicharr\u00f3n, or skin. Traditionally, it\u2019s prepared for Thanksgiving or Christmas, but for those of us in the diaspora, it\u2019s made for most special occasions. Shoulder is also a relatively inexpensive cut of meat, and it yields a lot of servings, leading to exciting leftovers. This recipe is deeply indebted to the chef Maricel Presilla and her recipe in \u201c<a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/Gran-Cocina-Latina/\">Gran Cocina Latina</a>,\u201d her cookbook published in 2012. Her method is a foolproof way to get that chicharr\u00f3n as well as tender meat that falls off the bone. It\u2019s blessed by her brilliance.
