{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Cider Whoopie Pies", "description": "Their name may be fun to say, but whoopie pies aren\u2019t really pies at all but rather soft, cakelike cookie sandwiches. These are inspired by a classic apple cider doughnut and, true to form, are dusted with cinnamon sugar. Apple cider that's been reduced and a bit of apple butter work in tandem to subtly flavor the fluffy cakes, and good old cream cheese frosting makes the ideal filling. For beautiful, uniformly sized cakes, use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to portion the batter for baking. If you don't have one, they might bake up a little wonky, but they\u2019ll still taste delightful.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/dining/ss-apple-cider-whoopie-pies-horizontal/ss-apple-cider-whoopie-pies-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, cookies and bars", "keywords": "apple butter, apple cider, confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, dark brown sugar, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 504}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 326, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "238 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cup/300 milliliters apple cider", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 2 tablespoons melted", "1/2 cup/110 grams packed dark brown sugar", "1 large egg", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters apple butter", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "6 ounces/170 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
