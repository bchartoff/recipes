{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Brisket With Plums, Star Anise and Port", "description": "For this recipe, I added plums to the onions in the sauce for brightness, and port for sweetness. Star anise and bay leaf add depth, but you could leave them out without anyone missing them, or substitute a cinnamon stick and orange zest. And if you don\u2019t want to use port, regular red wine spiked with a few tablespoons of honey or brown sugar is a nice substitute.\n\nIf you can, track down a second cut, or deckle, brisket for this dish. For lovers of fatty meat, this is brisket nirvana. It\u2019s juicy, it\u2019s succulent, it falls apart under the fork with barely a nudge. It\u2019s also as tasty as short ribs but less expensive, which is what you want when you\u2019re cooking for a large family dinner. You can\u2019t find the second cut in many supermarkets, but butchers have it if you ask.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/12/dining/12APPE_SPAN/12APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "brisket, plum, port, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 614}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 671, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "788 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 brisket (6 to 7 pounds), preferably second cut", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 1/2 tablespoons black pepper", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 bunch lemon thyme or regular thyme", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "3 white onions, thinly sliced", "1 cup ruby port", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "4 whole star anise (or 2 whole cloves)", "4 whole bay leaves", "2 1/2 pounds ripe but firm plums, halved and pitted", "Thyme leaves, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season brisket all over with salt and pepper.
