{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Polpettone With Spinach and Provolone", "description": "Polpette are Italian meatballs; polpettine are meatballs, too, but more diminutive. It follows, then, that polpettone is Italian for meatloaf (or a substantial meatball large enough to share). But polpettone is much more interesting than the somewhat bland everyday meatloaf known in the United States. Made from a mixture of meats and stuffed with spinach, herbs, cheese and mortadella, this moist, savory version is almost like a p\u00e2t\u00e9 or terrine, but easier to execute. It is delectable hot or cold.\n\nLearn how to assemble the polpettone with <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/13/dining/how-to-make-polpettone.html\">this step-by-step tutorial.</a>\n\nYou can find more of our meatloaf recipes <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/869706-meatloaf-thats-better-than-moms\">here</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/dining/18KITCHEN5/18KITCHEN5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "bread crumbs, eggs, ground beef, ground pork, ground veal, mortadella, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 200}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 583, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "43 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "599 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup cubed day-old bread, crusts removed", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 pound ground beef", "1 pound ground pork", "1 pound ground veal or turkey", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper", "Pinch of cayenne", "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1 teaspoon chopped rosemary", "1 teaspoon chopped thyme", "2 teaspoons chopped sage", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley", "3 ounces grated Parmesan, about 1/2 cup", "2 eggs, lightly beaten, plus 3 (8-minute) hard-boiled eggs, peeled, for filling", "1/4 pound thinly sliced mortadella or prosciutto", "1 pound spinach, briefly blanched, roughly chopped and squeezed dry", "3 ounces provolone or caciocavallo, sliced 1/8-inch thick", "1 cup fine dry bread crumbs, preferably homemade"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put bread cubes in a small bowl, cover with cream and set aside to soak until softened, about 10 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put beef, pork and veal in a mixing bowl.

Sprinkle with half the dry crumbs. You will now have a cylinder approximately 15 inches long. Twist ends of parchment to firm the mixture, then transfer to a deep-sided baking dish or roasting pan, and place it seam-side down. Carefully remove and discard parchment. With hands, press firmly to form cylinder into a long loaf with rounded ends. Dust top and sides with remaining bread crumbs. (The polpettone may be prepared to this point several hours, or up to 24 hours, in advance; keep refrigerated and bring to room temperature before baking.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until internal temperature is 140 degrees.
