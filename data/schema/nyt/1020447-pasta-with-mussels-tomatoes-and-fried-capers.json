{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Mussels, Tomatoes and Fried Capers", "description": "The best part of a big pot of mussels is arguably the broth, especially when it features plenty of garlic and wine. Here, the mussels and their broth \u2014 combined with ripe summer tomatoes \u2014 make a heady, rich sauce for pasta. A topping of toasted garlicky bread crumbs run through with fried capers gives the mixture texture and tang. This is just as good warm as it is hot, so feel free to make it up to an hour in advance, adding the herbs just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/dining/06apperex1/merlin_160015539_fa2be5e8-f33f-43a1-99f1-3f2c63d3b2ad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "bread crumbs, capers, mussels, pasta, tomato, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 272}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt, as needed", "8 ounces calamarata, rigatoni or other short pasta", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons drained capers, patted dry", "3 garlic cloves, 1 minced, 2 thinly sliced", "1/3 cup panko bread crumbs", "Large pinch of red-pepper flakes", "2 cups diced ripe, fresh tomatoes (2 medium tomatoes)", "Freshly ground black pepper, as needed", "Fresh lemon juice, to taste", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "3 large sprigs fresh oregano or marjoram", "2 pounds mussels, rinsed and debearded", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into small pieces", "1/4 cup torn fresh basil or mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium pot of heavily salted water to a boil.
