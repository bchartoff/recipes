{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pepperoni Pasta With Lemon and Garlic", "description": "Bits of chopped pepperoni crisp up almost like bacon when fried, with curled, browned edges and a savory, spicy bite. Here, they\u2019re the foundation of a hearty pasta sauce that\u2019s supremely satisfying and fast enough for a weeknight. Lemon, garlic and fennel seeds round out the flavors, and fresh herbs lend brightness. Taste the pepperoni before adding the optional red-pepper flakes. Depending on the brand of sausage, you might not need the extra kick. And if you don't have pepperoni on hand, any kind of salami will work.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/22/dining/17apperex/17apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "basil, orecchiette, pepperoni", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1401}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1 pound medium pasta shells or orecchiette", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "6 ounces pepperoni, thinly sliced, then coarsely chopped (about 2 cups)", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon fennel seeds, cracked with a mortar and pestle or the side of a chef\u2019s knife", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 small lemon, zested (if your lemon is very large, just zest half of it)", "3/4 cup torn fresh basil or parsley leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish", "Grated Parmesan, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
