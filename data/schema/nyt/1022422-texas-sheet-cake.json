{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Texas Sheet Cake", "description": "Expansive yet barely an inch tall, this chocolate-on-chocolate special of the Lone Star State starts with a cake that\u2019s even lighter than devil\u2019s food. A hot cocoa icing sheens its surface and soaks into the warm cake a bit, deepening its richness. Variations abound among cooks, but baking the batter in a shallow pan is key to achieving the just-right, fudgy-fluffy balance of icing to cake. While some recipes include pecans in the icing, this version keeps them on top of the cake so they stay crisp. It also calls for enough nuts to generously cover the whole top so there\u2019s crunch in every bite. If you\u2019d like, you can sprinkle the top with a little flaky or coarse salt too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/28/dining/23texcakerex/merlin_190773750_f6fb4ba6-9e60-4481-aef4-d5cbeb003b1d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "One 13-by-18-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 865}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/227 grams unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 cups/215 grams chopped pecans", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/3 packed cup/40 grams unsweetened natural cocoa powder", "1 cup hot coffee or water", "1/2 cup/115 grams sour cream", "2 large eggs, beaten", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter", "1/3 packed cup/40 grams unsweetened natural cocoa powder", "1/4 cup/60 grams whole milk", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "2 1/2 packed cups/360 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
