{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pocket Dressing", "description": "In a lot of states, people don\u2019t just eat food on Thanksgiving; they hunt for it. Lora Smith, a writer and farmer with roots in Kentucky, sends along a recipe handed down from her great-grandmother, for her family\u2019s \u201cpocket\u201d dressing: a baked patty of dressing that slides easily into the pockets and knapsacks of rabbit and quail hunters. The Smiths also have the patties at the table, where they are passed around on a platter. \n\nTexture is key. The outside must be browned and crisp. Inside, softness comes from cornbread and biscuits, and chewiness from foraged mushrooms. A family member (traditionally, the oldest matriarch)  leaves a thumbprint indentation on each patty before baking, so that a little gravy can settle and soak in. \n\nThe hunt continued through Thanksgiving weekend. \u201cThey\u2019d again take the leftover dressing wrapped in wax paper with them, and sometimes turkey sandwiches or turkey with fresh biscuits pulled out of the oven that morning,\u201d  Ms. Smith said. \u201cMy father always carried a small backpack where he kept extra leftovers and cold bottles of Coke. His other job was to carry the rabbits and quail they shot in the backpack.\u201d When the weather was especially chilly, the patties solved another problem. According to Ms. Smith, \u201cthey also served as nice hand warmers.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19KENTUCKY/19KENTUCKY-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H25M", "recipeYield": "24 patties", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "biscuits, chestnut, cornbread, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 316, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "377 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Olive oil, for the muffin tins", "1 pound buttermilk biscuits (about 12 2 1/2-inch biscuits) or 1/2 loaf stale white bread", "1 batch cornbread from 8-inch-square pan, preferably not sweet (see note)", "12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) butter", "1 large onion, chopped, (1 1/2 cups)", "5 stalks celery, chopped (2 cups)", "5 sage leaves, roughly chopped", "10 ounces roasted chestnuts (store-bought is fine), chopped", "Salt and pepper", "1 pound shiitake or cremini mushrooms (or a combination), chopped", "3 eggs, beaten", "2 to 3 cups turkey broth"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
