When fat has reached about 350 degrees, slip in chicken pieces, dark meat first, being careful not to crowd them. (To test temperature, use a candy thermometer or dip a corner of a chicken piece into the fat; if vigorous bubbling ensues, the temperature is right.) Turn heat down and cook chicken for 10 minutes. Turn pieces with tongs. Cook until other side is browned, another 10 to 12 minutes. Drain on a wire rack over paper towels."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6093-julia-reeds-fried-chicken"}
