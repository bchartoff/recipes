{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Charred Broccoli", "description": "New Nordic cuisine has spread far beyond Scandinavia in the last few years, and this dish goes a long toward explaining why. The broccoli, seared but still crunchy, is brightened by a beguilingly salty, savory and garlicky aioli, then finished with buttery seasoned panko. While the recipe requires multiple steps and some attention to make sure the bread crumbs and garlic are not overcooked, the preparation pulls together easily. This dish also lends itself well to situations where time may be limited, as both the aioli and bread crumbs can easily be prepared ahead of time. The result is a composed, umami-laden dish that is rich but balanced.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/19/dining/20140219-NORDIC-slide-GFS0/20140219-NORDIC-slide-GFS0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "broccoli, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 52}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 843, "unsaturatedFatContent": "63 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "81 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "676 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons salted butter", "1 cup panko", "2 tablespoons rendered chicken fat, duck fat or vegetable oil", "4 anchovies packed in salt or oil, soaked in cold water for 10 minutes, drained and chopped", "1 teaspoon minced dried shallots, or substitute 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh onion or shallot", "1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste", "5 cloves whole garlic, peeled", "1 cup grapeseed oil", "2 large eggs", "1 tablespoon fish sauce (preferably Three Crabs brand), or more as needed", "1 1/2 teaspoons apple vinegar, preferably Bragg unfiltered", "1 1/2 teaspoons caper juice", "1/2 teaspoon lemon juice", "1 head broccoli, woody stem removed, sliced lengthwise about 1/2-inch thick, keeping as many of the florets connected to the stem as possible", "3 tablespoons grapeseed oil", "1/4 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the bread crumbs: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
