{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Chipotle Chicken Pozole", "description": "A pressure cooker is the perfect tool for making a quick pozole that tastes like it has simmered for a long time. Traditional red pozole usually requires toasting and pur\u00e9eing dried chiles for a flavorful broth, but this one relies on canned chipotles for smoky complexity. Chipotles can be fiery, so feel free to use fewer peppers if you\u2019re concerned about the heat, but don\u2019t skimp on the adobo sauce: It\u2019s milder than the peppers and is packed with loads of smoky, garlicky flavor. Serve the soup in bowls with plenty of crumbled cheese, diced avocado and crushed chips, for topping.\n\n<p><em>The slow-cooker version of this dish uses bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, carrots and celery, is available <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019692-slow-cooker-shortcut-chicken-pozole?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=1\">here</a>.</p></em>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-chipotle-chicken-pozole/sd-pressure-cooker-chipotle-chicken-pozole-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken thigh, chipotle, corn, hominy, onion, pozole, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 419}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 389, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1117 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 large red or yellow onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt", "8 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 (7-ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "5 cups chicken broth or stock", "1 cup frozen corn", "1 (29-ounce) can pozole (hominy), rinsed and well drained", "Juice of 1 lime (about 2 tablespoons), plus more as needed", "Crushed tortilla chips, shredded cabbage, diced avocado, crumbled queso fresco, minced red onion and cilantro, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using the saut\u00e9 setting, heat oil in a 6- to 8-quart pressure cooker.
