It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nSometimes I get it into my head to make a fancy grilled cheese sandwich. I don\u2019t have a recipe because you don\u2019t really need a recipe to make grilled cheese sandwiches. You just need desire, and a triangle in your head: salt; crunch; melting ooze. So I\u2019ll slice some mild Cheddar. Get some decent bread, a sliced jalape\u00f1o, the tail end of a beefsteak tomato. Then, sizzle-sizzle-flip-flip in some unsalted butter, and top with a sunny-side-up egg. It\u2019s the simplest kind of cooking, and on a weeknight that\u2019s exactly what most of us need.
