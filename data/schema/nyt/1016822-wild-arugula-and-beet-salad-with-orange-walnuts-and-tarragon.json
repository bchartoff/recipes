{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wild Arugula and Beet Salad With Orange, Walnuts and Tarragon", "description": "This is a salad filled with contrasting sweet and peppery flavors. Pungent wild arugula contrasts beautifully with sweet beets, anisy tarragon and juicy oranges. If you can find purslane, it makes a great addition to the salad, with its earthy flavor and almost juicy, delicate crunch. You can use a mix of colors for the beets. I roasted golden and red beets together, and the red beets bled into the outside layer of the golden beets, making their color striking in the salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/23/science/26recipehealthorange/25recipehealthorange-1411398778484-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 118}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "278 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups wild arugula", "1/2 cup chopped purslane, if available (substitute more arugula if not)", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon", "3 to 4 tablespoons chopped walnuts", "2 large or 4 small or medium beets, any color or a mix, roasted peeled and cut in wedges", "1 navel orange, peeled, pith removed, and sections cut from between membranes", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1 small garlic clove, pur\u00e9ed or put through a press", "1 tablespoon walnut oil", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground pepper (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine  the salad ingredients in a large bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together balsamic vinegar, salt, sherry vinegar, garlic, walnut oil and olive oil.
