{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buckwheat Cr\u00eapes", "description": "My favorite French street food, these are easy cr\u00eapes to make. If you keep them in the freezer, you can pull one out and top it with blanched spinach and a fried or poached egg for a quick and delicious meal. In France the crepe is made on a large, flat, hot griddle, and the egg is cracked right on top of it. That doesn\u2019t work well in a home cr\u00eape pan. It\u2019s easier to have the cr\u00eape already made and then top it with the fried egg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/04/30/health/30recipehealth_600/30recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "About 12 8-inch cr\u00eapes", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "brunch", "keywords": "buckwheat flour, gruy\u00e8re, spinach, halal, healthy, kosher, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 127}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 146, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "198 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup low-fat (2 percent) milk", "1/3 cup water", "3 large eggs", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2/3 cup buckwheat flour", "1/2 cup unbleached white flour", "3 tablespoons canola oil", "6 ounces baby spinach", "Salt, preferably kosher salt", "freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 buckwheat cr\u00eapes, above", "2 eggs, poached or fried for four minutes", "2 tablespoons grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the milk, water, eggs and salt in a blender.
