{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Miso Chicken With Radishes and Lime", "description": "This vibrant dish is adapted from \u201cKeeping It Simple\u201d (Hardie Grant, 2020), a book of weeknight recipes by the food writer Yasmin Fahr. Miso and ghee are tossed with radishes and rubbed underneath the skin of chicken thighs before both are roasted on the same sheet pan. Fresh scallions, sesame seeds and lime juice provide a bright finish. If you don\u2019t have ghee, regular unsalted butter will do just fine. And if you\u2019ve never had roasted radishes, you\u2019re in for a treat: High heat eliminates the vegetable\u2019s bitterness, coaxes out its sweetness and leaves the lovely pink color behind.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/27/dining/20cookbookrex4/merlin_171384615_f5635e5e-6c32-4c35-962a-8782cc72f547-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, one pot, poultry, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "chicken, chicken thigh, ghee, miso, radish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1107}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds total)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon ghee or unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 1/2 teaspoons white miso paste", "1 pound trimmed radishes, halved, if large", "1 lime, cut in half", "2 scallions, light green and white parts only, thinly sliced", "Black or white sesame seeds, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
