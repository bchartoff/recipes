It\u2019s for a fantastic dish of spaghetti and crabs that was taught to them by Tony Durazzo, a Carroll Gardens raconteur and friend of the Spuntino, in which crabs are simmered in tomato sauce and then served to the side of a platter of spaghetti covered in that same sauce, now infused with the flavor of the crustaceans. You really ought to cook it right now. Then make a mess, eating it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/Spaghetti-With-Crabs/Spaghetti-With-Crabs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 23}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 545, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "87 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "438 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "3 cloves garlic, peeled, smashed and minced", "1 28-ounce can peeled tomatoes, preferably San Marzano", "2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or to taste", "4 large blue crabs", "Kosher salt", "1 pound dry spaghetti", "1/2 cup fresh basil leaves", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
