{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Okonomiyaki (Japanese Cabbage and Pork Pancakes)", "description": "Crisp on the outside and custardy in the center, okonomiyaki are pan-fried Japanese pancakes that traditionally feature a filling of cabbage and pork belly. Here, bacon can be substituted for the pork belly, replaced with shrimp or omitted entirely. You can find the more unusual toppings like hondashi, Kewpie mayonnaise, okonomi sauce and dried bonito at any Japanese market. Similar to Worcestershire sauce but sweeter and less salty, the okonomi sauce is combined with Kewpie mayonnaise and umami-rich bonito flakes for a playful topping. This adaptable recipe is a great way to use up leftovers or other vegetables, such as shredded carrots, bean sprouts or chopped snap peas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/dining/kc-okonomiyaki/merlin_151400679_9cbb2786-bddb-4c60-8aa2-4c70c3f86c5e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "Two 7-inch pancakes", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "pancakes, project, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, cabbage, dashi, green cabbage, pickled red ginger, pork belly, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 173}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 751, "unsaturatedFatContent": "41 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "55 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "784 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon hondashi (bonito soup stock) or instant dashi", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "4 cups finely shredded green cabbage (about 1/2 pound)", "1 cup thinly sliced scallions (about 5 scallions)", "1 tablespoon drained pickled red ginger (or finely chopped pickled sushi ginger)", "1/4 cup safflower or canola oil", "3 ounces sliced pork belly or bacon, cut crosswise into 5-inch pieces", "Okonomi sauce, Kewpie mayonnaise, dried shaved bonito and shredded nori, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine hondashi with 1 cup water and whisk until dissolved.
