It makes a luxurious fall or winter vegetarian main course. The chef who wrote the recipe for this Russian classic, Bonnie Frumkin Morales, says she knows it is tempting to add garnishes like snipped chives or seasonings like black pepper. But the pure flavor of the mushrooms and cream, which saturates the potatoes, is best appreciated alone.
