{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Mushroom and Butternut Squash Tart", "description": "This is a substantial tart with a crunchy, whole-grain dough. Don\u2019t be put off by the yeast in the dough. It makes it both airy and crisp, and isn\u2019t at all hard to handle. You don\u2019t even need a mixer; this dough comes together quickly and easily by hand. For the most complex flavors, use a variety of different types of mushrooms, though just one kind is fine if that's what you have. Oysters, maitake, shiitake, black trumpet and chanterelles are best, but even cremini mushrooms work nicely. Serve this warm or at room temperature, preferably within 6 hours of baking for the crispiest crust, though it will hold up for a day or two if you store it in the refrigerator and reheat it in a 300 degree oven before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/24/dining/1S4A8944/1S4A8944-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, pies and tarts", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, butternut squash, cheddar, leek, mushroom, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 629}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 305, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "425 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed", "3/4 cup/110 grams whole-wheat or rye flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "10 ounces/283 grams oyster or other mushrooms, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 4 cups)", "3 large leeks, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced (about 4 cups)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "1 pound/454 grams butternut squash, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick (about 2 cups)", "Fine sea salt, to taste", "Black pepper, to taste", "1 teaspoon chopped thyme leaves", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste", "1 cup/114 grams grated white Cheddar or Gruy\u00e8re cheese", "2 tablespoons chopped chives (optional)", "Fresh lemon juice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a medium bowl, sprinkle dry yeast and sugar over 2/3 cup/158 milliliters warm water.
