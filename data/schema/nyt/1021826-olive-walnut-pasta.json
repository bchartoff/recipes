{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Olive-Walnut Pasta", "description": "Double down on the olive oil flavor in this dish by warming a generous amount with torn green olives to dress your pasta. While you can use just one kind of olive, like mild Castelvetrano, a variety will create depth of flavor. Adding chopped walnuts provides texture and a nice dose of protein to this vegan dish, while lemon zest and juice perk everything up. It would also be good with soft herbs like oregano, dill or basil, a salty cheese like feta or Parmesan, or shrimp that's been cooked with the pasta in the last few minutes of boiling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/20/dining/as-olive-pasta/merlin_193478520_461dd2c5-e850-4312-a433-315bc6a9207e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "olives, pasta, walnut, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1141}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound short pasta, like orecchiette, cavatelli, fusilli or elbows", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 cups chopped walnuts", "1 1/4 cups Castelvetrano olives (or a mixture of green olives), pitted and torn", "1 small garlic clove, peeled", "1 lemon, zested and juiced (about 3 tablespoons juice)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
