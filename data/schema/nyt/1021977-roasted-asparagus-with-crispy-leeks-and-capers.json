{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Asparagus With Crispy Leeks and Capers", "description": "In this supremely springy recipe, thick asparagus stalks and thinly sliced leeks are glossed with olive oil and covered in salty capers. Everything is roasted in the same pan and emerges tender and golden-edged. Capers also make an appearance in the mustard sauce served alongside, which adds a tangy, mayonnaise-like richness. You can double the recipe, if you wish, though you may have to increase the roasting time by a few minutes to make up for a more-crowded pan. Serve this on its own as a first course, or as an accompaniment to roast chicken, braised meats or seared fish. Just don\u2019t use thin asparagus: It\u2019ll cook too quickly, before the leeks have a chance to turn golden. Stick with spears that are at least 1/2 inch in diameter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/dining/12Apperex/merlin_184858497_fc38c5ab-b83d-4940-9698-9943b0e94909-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "asparagus, capers, dijon mustard, leek, passover, spring, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 792}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound thick asparagus, ends\u00a0trimmed", "2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 large leek, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "Lemon wedges, for serving", "1/4 cup parsley, leaves and tender stems, torn", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 teaspoons drained capers, finely chopped", "1 small garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
