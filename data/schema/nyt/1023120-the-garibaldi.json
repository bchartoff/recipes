{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Garibaldi", "description": "Named for the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi, who played a leading role in the unification of Italy, the classic recipe for this two-ingredient drink combines Campari, from Northern Italy, and fresh orange juice, a nod to Sicily in the south. This modern version features orange bitters and a pinch of salt, as well as an ounce of grapefruit juice. (If you want to skip grapefruit, you can also use five full ounces of orange juice.) Whether you make the classic or modern iteration, the key to the best Garibaldi is very fresh, very frothy citrus juice. For that, you\u2019ll want freshly squeezed citrus and a firm, long, dry (without ice) shake, or, if you prefer, you can pulse the juice in a blender for a few seconds to aerate before adding to the glass.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/dining/15Brunchrex1/merlin_205050570_2371148b-1942-4bfc-ba85-5f8b274efa03-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "brunch, cocktails", "keywords": "campari, grapefruit juice, orange juice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 315}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice", "1 1/2 ounces red bitter liqueur, such as Campari, Cappelletti or Contratto Bitter", "3 to 4 dashes orange bitters", "4 ounces fresh orange juice", "1 ounce fresh grapefruit juice", "Pinch of flaky sea salt", "Orange or grapefruit wedge or wheel, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a Collins or highball glass with ice, add the red bitter liqueur and the bitters."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a shaker, without ice, add the orange and grapefruit juices, and the salt.
