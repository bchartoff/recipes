{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Best Lemon Bars", "description": "Lemon bars are all about contrast: sour lemon and sweet sugar, crumbly base and creamy topping, buttery crust and tart filling. Two common ingredients lift this recipe above the pack: baking powder for a fluffy filling and shredded coconut for a rich, round-tasting crust. (Once baked, the coconut flavor almost disappears.)\u00a0 Bakers who avoid preservatives will find an easy version of homemade sweetened coconut in the tip below the recipe.) For thicker lemon squares, use the square baking pan; for thinner ones, the large rectangle. For an easy lemon tart, simply cut the recipe in half and bake it in an 8-inch round tart pan, pressing the crust up the sides.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/21/dining/21LEMON1/21LEMON1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 2 to 3 dozen bars, depending on size", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, cookies and bars", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, lemon, shredded sweetened coconut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 954}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 156, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "45 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/240 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/225 grams very cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut into small chunks", "1/2 cup/50 grams sweetened shredded coconut (see note)", "1/4 cup/30 grams confectioners' sugar, more for sprinkling", "Pinch of salt", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "4 eggs", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1/4 cup/30 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
