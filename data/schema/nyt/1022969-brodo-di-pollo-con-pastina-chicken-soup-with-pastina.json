Pastina comes in a variety of shapes, like little stars and rounds. For this recipe, you can use any tiny shape you like, or use noodles broken into small pieces. Typically, the pastina is precooked in a separate pot and added to each soup bowl alongside shredded chicken, but this version cooks everything together for an easy one-pot meal. And this comforting chicken soup does not require premade or even store-bought broth: Instead, boneless, skinless chicken breasts cook in water with aromatics like onion, carrots, celery and garlic \u2014 and a good drizzle of olive oil \u2014 for a rich, flavorful broth that comes together fairly quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/07/dining/nd-chicken-soup-with-pastina/merlin_201238131_98f3828d-ee84-4ebf-a891-ed7ef2781ebc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, one pot, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, chicken soup, orzo, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2165}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound)", "1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), or to taste", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "3 large carrots, peeled and sliced into \u00bc-inch half moons", "3 large celery ribs, sliced into \u00bc-inch half moons", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 teaspoons tomato paste", "1/2 cup pastina, such as Acini di Pepe, or orzo (about 4 ounces)", "1/2 cup finely chopped parsley", "Grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the chicken and 10 cups of water in a large pot.
