{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry Lemon Meringue Pie", "description": "All the goodness of lemon meringue pie tastes even better with cranberries in the mix. It\u2019s not just their fruity tartness that makes them so appealing, the little berries are also full of pectin, which helps set the filling so that it\u2019s soft yet sliceable. And, of course, they give the pie a bright magenta hue. To show it off, you can dollop the whipped egg whites only in the center, but the unanchored meringue may slide around when you cut wedges. You can cover the top completely to keep the meringue in place and surprise guests with the brilliant pink filling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/13/dining/13PIESREX-meringue/merlin_214872654_37916e5b-f2a8-46f7-ac32-31ba67ce6baf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "cranberry, lemon, make-ahead, pie, pie dough, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1015}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 disk <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023573\">All-Butter Pie Crust</a>", "All-purpose flour, for rolling", "1 cup/211 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "2 medium lemons", "3 cups/343 grams fresh or frozen cranberries", "2 packed tablespoons cornstarch", "4 large eggs, separated", "3 tablespoons/42 grams cold unsalted butter", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "1/2 cup/70 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If the dough has been refrigerated for more than an hour, let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
