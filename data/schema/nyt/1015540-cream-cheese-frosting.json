{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cream Cheese Frosting", "description": "Made with much less confectioners\u2019 sugar than the usual cream cheese frosting, it\u2019s sturdy, dependable and not too sweet - just right for a child\u2019s birthday party or to ice three-dozen cupcakes for a bake sale. While it\u2019s not quite as silky as a buttercream based on beaten eggs and sugar syrup, it\u2019s much, much less persnickety to make and it holds up well without refrigeration for several hours before it starts getting soft. Plus, the cream cheese makes it incredibly creamy while adding a tangy bite that helps tone down the sweetness of the confectioners\u2019 sugar. To make lemon cream cheese buttercream (which tastes a little like a cheesecake), substitute one tablespoon lemon juice for the vanilla and add a teaspoon of grated lemon zest to the frosting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/dining/20COOKING-BUTTERCREAM1/20COOKING-BUTTERCREAM1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 300}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 297, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "121 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 sticks (1 cup, 8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature", "2 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 tablespoons milk, more as needed", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using an electric mixer, whip the butter and cream cheese together until light and fluffy.
