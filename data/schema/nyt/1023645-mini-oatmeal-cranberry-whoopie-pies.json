{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mini Oatmeal-Cranberry Whoopie Pies", "description": "These whoopie pies may be small, but they are packed with flavor. Chewy oatmeal cookies are spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, and studded with dried cranberries. After baking, they\u2019re sandwiched around a tangy, fluffy cream cheese and cranberry filling. Make them up to three days ahead and store them in the refrigerator, stacked between pieces of parchment paper in an airtight container, or freeze them for up to 1 month. Feel free to add chopped pecans or walnuts for crunch, and substitute other dried fruit (raisins, chopped apricots, diced apple) for the cranberries. These are as adaptable as they are adorable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/16Appetite-Oatmeal-Cranberry-Whoopie-Pies/merlin_214747602_6fb43631-d8fb-4774-b736-bb0f3b2c6ee9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen sandwich cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "cookie, cream cheese, dried cranberry, freezer friendly, make-ahead, rolled oat, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 311}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1 cup/210 grams dark brown sugar", "1/3 cup/66 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "3 cups/350 grams rolled oats (not instant)", "1 1/2 cups/225 grams dried cranberries", "8 ounces/227 grams cream cheese, softened", "2 cups/230 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 cup/228 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1/3 cup/100 grams whole-berry cranberry sauce, preferably homemade but canned is OK (don\u2019t use jellied sauce, as it\u2019s too thin)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees with racks in top and bottom thirds, and line 4 baking sheets with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cookies: In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat together butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar until fluffy, about 2 minutes.
