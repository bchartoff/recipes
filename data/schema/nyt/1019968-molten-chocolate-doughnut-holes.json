You could, of course, use a stand mixer to prepare the dough, but it\u2019s better done by hand since the mixer will have trouble blending such a small amount. Don\u2019t worry when you first add the butter pieces and they smear around without incorporating. The butter will be evenly distributed by the time you finish kneading the dough. Chocolate f\u00e8ves or discs make easy work of filling the doughnuts, but if you can\u2019t find them, feel free to use your favorite chips or chopped chocolate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/dining/ss-chocolate-doughnut-holes/ss-chocolate-doughnut-holes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "14 doughnuts", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "active dry yeast, bittersweet chocolate, butter, flour, milk, sugar, dessert, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 199, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "77 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons warm whole milk (about 110 degrees)", "2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons diced unsalted butter,\u00a0at room temperature, plus more for the bowl", "1/3 cup/55 grams\u00a0bittersweet chocolate f\u00e8ves, chips or coarsely chopped chocolate", "1 quart/945 milliliters vegetable oil, for frying", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a small bowl, combine the milk, yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar.
