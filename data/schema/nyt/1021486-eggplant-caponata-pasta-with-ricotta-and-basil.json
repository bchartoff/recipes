{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggplant Caponata Pasta With Ricotta and Basil", "description": "This weeknight pasta is inspired by traditional caponata, a tangy, salty-sweet Italian dish made with saut\u00e9ed eggplant, tomatoes, caramelized onions, capers, anchovies, olives and vinegar. Though caponata is often served as a side, salad or relish, this eggplant saut\u00e9 forms the foundation of a hearty vegetarian pasta. For the best results, taste and season your eggplant mixture with salt and pepper as you cook little by little \u2014 or even recklessly. It should taste quite salty and tangy on its own, but will mellow when tossed with pasta, pasta water and creamy ricotta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/25/dining/aw-eggplant-caponata-pasta/merlin_174184335_b52b1bc8-b8a0-42f5-9f0d-2ba5700df1e2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "basil, capers, eggplant, garlic, pasta, pine nuts, raisins, sugar, vinegar, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1599}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/3 cup raisins, preferably yellow", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more if desired", "2 small Italian eggplants (2 pounds total), trimmed and cut into 3/4-inch cubes", "12 ounces orecchiette (or other shaped pasta)", "1/3 cup finely chopped shallot (about 1 small shallot)", "1/4 cup pine nuts", "3 tablespoons drained brined capers", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/3 packed cup thinly sliced fresh basil leaves, plus more torn leaves for garnish", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1 cup fresh ricotta or burrata (about 8 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.
