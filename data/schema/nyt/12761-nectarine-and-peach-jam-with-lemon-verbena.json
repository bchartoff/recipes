{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nectarine and Peach Jam With Lemon Verbena", "description": "This is refrigerator jam, allowing you to skip the fuss and time of canning. Here, you\u2019ll use a method from Christine Ferber, one of France\u2019s eminent jam makers. She calls for macerating the fruit in sugar overnight so the juices release, then straining the liquid from the bowl and cooking that down to a syrup before re-adding the fruit. That allows you to cook the fruit less, retaining a better texture and fresher flavor. It works beautifully with this combination of peaches and nectarines spiked with lemon verbena.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/09/dining/nectarinejam2/nectarinejam2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 half-pint jars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, condiments", "keywords": "lemon verbena, nectarine, peach, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 56}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1100, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "284 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "103 milligrams", "sugarContent": "257 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "3 pounds ripe nectarines or peaches, or a mix, pitted and sliced", "730 grams sugar (3 and 1/4 cups)", "Pinch salt", "10 sprigs fresh lemon verbena"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate zest from half the lemon and place zest in a large saucepan.
