{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Hasselback Potato Gratin", "description": "This golden and glorious mash-up of potato gratin and Hasselback potatoes, from the acclaimed food science writer J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt, has been engineered to give you both creamy potato and singed edge in each bite. The principal innovation here is placing the sliced potatoes in the casserole dish vertically, on their edges, rather than laying them flat as in a standard gratin, in order to get those crisp ridges on top. Allow extra time for the task of slicing the potatoes, for which it's helpful to have a mandoline or food processor (though not necessary, strictly speaking). And do buy extra potatoes, just in case; you want to pack the potatoes tightly and keep them standing up straight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Weinstein"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/30/dining/30COOKBOOK1/30COOKBOOK1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "gruy\u00e8re, heavy cream, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2815}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 663, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "1006 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces finely grated Gruy\u00e8re or comt\u00e9 cheese", "2 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano", "2 cups heavy cream", "2 medium cloves garlic, minced", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 to 4 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/8-inch thick on a mandoline slicer (7 to 8 medium, see note)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees.
