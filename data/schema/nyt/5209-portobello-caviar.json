In a very large skillet set over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the portobellos, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Raise the heat to high, add the vinegar and cook, stirring, until the vinegar has evaporated. Remove from the heat. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and serve warm or at room temperature with bread or crackers, or use in the baked-portobellos-with-sour-cream recipe that follows.
