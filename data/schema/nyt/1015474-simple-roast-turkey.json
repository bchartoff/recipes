{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Simple Roast Turkey", "description": "For all the attention we lavish on Thanksgiving turkeys, the truth is more work does not necessarily yield a better bird. That's right: You can skip brining, stuffing, trussing and basting. Instead of a messy wet brine, use a dry rub (well, technically a dry brine) \u2014 a salt and pepper massage that locks in moisture and seasons the flesh. No stuffing or trussing allows the bird to cook more quickly, with the white and dark meat finishing closer to the same time. And if you oil but don\u2019t baste your turkey, you\u2019ll get crisp skin without constantly opening the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/unturkey-still/unturkey-still-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2085}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 turkey (10 to 12 pounds)", "Coarse kosher salt", "1 tablespoon black pepper", "1 lemon, zested and quartered", "1 bunch fresh thyme or rosemary", "1 bunch fresh sage", "12 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 bottle hard apple cider (12 ounces)", "Dry white wine, as needed", "2 onions, peeled and quartered", "3 bay leaves", "Olive oil or melted butter, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove any giblets from the cavity and reserve for stock or gravy.
