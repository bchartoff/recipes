{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Ganache With Black Sesame and Miso", "description": "In this highly sophisticated confection, soft chocolate ganache and crumbly black sesame streusel sit on top of a salty-sweet black sesame and miso cream. Eaten together, the flavors veer toward the savory side \u2014 as perfect for people who don\u2019t usually like sweets as it is for dessert lovers looking for nuance and depth.\nAt NA/NA in Paris, the chef Nathaly Nicolas-Ianniello garnishes this differently depending on the season \u2013 using some combination of micro herbs, edible flowers, and/or tart berries, such as currants or wild blueberries. But it\u2019s also wonderful served plain, with just the crunchy bits of near-black streusel dotting the top.\nYou can make all the components days in advance, but don\u2019t combine them until just before serving. The textural contrast of creamy, sandy and crisp is part of the charm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/06/dining/06CHEF2/06CHEF2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, pastries", "keywords": "black sesame seeds, corn syrup, dark chocolate, Demerara sugar, Dutch-processed cocoa powder, miso, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 28}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 937, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "72 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "38 grams", "sodiumContent": "449 milligrams", "sugarContent": "38 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "1 teaspoon powdered gelatin", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1/4 cup/80 grams honey, more to taste", "7 tablespoons/120 grams black sesame paste (see note)", "1/4 cup/58 grams sweet miso (see note, or use 2 tablespoons/29 grams white shiro miso)", "3/4 cup/150 grams chopped dark chocolate (around 70 percent)", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/150 grams heavy cream", "1 1/2 tablespoons/30 grams light corn syrup or honey", "1 1/2 tablespoons/20 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/4 cup/50 grams finely chopped dark chocolate (around 70 percent)", "4 tablespoons/66 grams unsalted butter, cold and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/50 grams all-purpose flour", "2 1/2 tablespoons/32 grams packed light brown sugar", "2 1/2 tablespoons/30 grams Demerara sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons/7 grams unsweetened, Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "Pinch kosher salt", "1/4 cup/30 grams black sesame seeds, more for serving", "Micro herbs, edible flowers or berries, such as red currants or wild blueberries, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the sesame-miso cream: Place 1/2 cup milk in a small bowl, then sprinkle gelatin over the top.
