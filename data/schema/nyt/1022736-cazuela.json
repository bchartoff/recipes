{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cazuela", "description": "Puerto Rican cazuela, a richly spiced crustless pie with a texture between thick custard and bread pudding, is a unique dessert with a complex history. The name means \u201ccooking pot\u201d in Spanish, and the key ingredients \u2014 batata (white sweet potato), pumpkin and coconut milk \u2014 and the traditional cooking process speak to the island\u2019s African ancestry. Flavored with ginger, cloves, cinnamon and anise, this dish also includes spices brought to the Caribbean during the spice trade. Cazuela has been prepared since at least the 19th century, and today it\u2019s largely reserved for holidays. This version is an adaptation of the classic, with sweet plantain added for flavor, and a tip for using canned ingredients. While this dessert may seem challenging at first glance, it is incredibly adaptable and can be prepared days in advance in a casserole dish, ramekins or even foil cupcake tins.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/09/dining/vd-cazuela/merlin_197232318_f0667075-5cbe-4302-a6b5-5bef19a6339c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "calabaza, coconut milk, plantain, pumpkin, sweet potato, christmas, thanksgiving, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 390}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 to 2 large banana leaves, trimmed of stiff edges (optional)\u00a0", "3 1/2 tablespoons salted butter, softened", "2 star anise pods", "2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt\u00a0", "1 1/2 pounds/680 grams white sweet potatoes (Korean or Dominican), peeled and chopped into 2-inch chunks (about 4 heaping cups) (see Tip)", "1 1/2 pounds/680 grams calabaza or pumpkin, seeded, peeled and chopped into 2-inch chunks (about 4 heaping cups)\u00a0", "1 large very ripe plantain, peeled and sliced into 2-inch rounds (about 1 to 2 cups)\u00a0", "1 cup/240 milliliters full-fat coconut milk, stirred very well", "3 large eggs", "2 tablespoons brandy", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract\u00a0", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\u00a0", "1 teaspoon ground ginger\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 cup/220 grams dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup/78 grams rice flour or all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/72 grams golden raisins", "Lightly sweetened whipped cream, toasted grated coconut, dark chocolate shavings, for topping (optional)\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using banana leaves, soften them by gently heating each side, turning continuously, over an open gas burner until pliable, about 1 or 2 minutes.
