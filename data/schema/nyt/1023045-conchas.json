{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Conchas", "description": "Without a doubt, conchas are the most iconic of Mexican pan dulce, a category that includes sweet rolls, pastries and cookies. They are such an important part of everyday life in Mexico that you're sure to run into one anywhere in the country, as long as there is a panader\u00eda or a small grocery nearby. The soft, brioche-style buns are firm enough to hold their shape while carrying a sweet and crumbly topping traditionally engraved with a seashell design. (Special concha molds can be ordered online, but everyday kitchen tools like a wooden popsicle stick or a dinner knife work well, too.) The most popular flavors are vanilla and chocolate. This recipe includes those topping options, as well as a playful caf\u00e9 con leche flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/21conchasrex1/merlin_203820735_814f6458-aa1b-4232-9c23-313907dcd691-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H30M", "recipeYield": "15 buns", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "breads, pastries, project", "keywords": "butter, egg, flour, vegetable shortening", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 328}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/520 grams all-purpose flour (or bread flour, see Tip), plus more for dusting", "7 tablespoons/87 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt (Morton)", "1 tablespoon instant yeast", "3/4 cup/175 grams whole milk, at room temperature", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "13 tablespoons/185 grams unsalted butter, diced and brought to room temperature, plus more for greasing", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 1/2 cups/184 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "1 cup/180 grams vegetable shortening", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 1/2 cups/184 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "1 cup/180 grams vegetable shortening", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 tablespoons instant espresso coffee combined with 2 teaspoons boiling water", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 1/3 cups/170 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "1 cup/180 grams vegetable shortening", "1/4 cup/22 grams cocoa powder combined with 3 tablespoons boiling water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.

Cover a small area of your countertop with a light layer of flour.

One by one, pat each piece of dough into a flat shape on the floured surface, then draw the edges into the center, working your way around, pinching the dough together into the center of what should now be a ball. Turn the ball over, cup it with your hand and move it in circles, rolling it over the counter for a few seconds to make a neater round. Repeat with the remaining conchas and place 5 equally spaced balls on each of the 3 prepared baking sheets. Make sure there is a bit of flour on the counter before pressing each piece of dough, as the dough is very sticky."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make your preferred topping (see Tip): Combine all the ingredients for the selected topping flavor in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed until the ingredients begin to combine, about 20 to 30 seconds.

Set the ball in one palm and, using the other hand, pat it out into a 3\u00bd-inch round, as if you were patting a thick tortilla. (The topping is very sticky and soft, like a thick frosting, so you should moisten your hands as needed.) Place the round disk over a concha and slide your fingers around the edges of the topping, pressing it lightly around the rim to gently adhere to the bun. The topping should not go all the way down to the parchment paper, but be at least about \u00bc inch from it.

The mold should make a shell-shaped mark on the concha topping, merely indenting it without breaking through to the dough. If you don\u2019t have a concha mold, you can make the shape with a dinner knife by dipping it in flour and marking each concha with curves, lines or squares, but avoiding piercing through to the dough."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cover the conchas with clean kitchen towels and set in a warm, draft-free area of your kitchen until they puff considerably, anywhere from 1\u00bd to 2 hours.
