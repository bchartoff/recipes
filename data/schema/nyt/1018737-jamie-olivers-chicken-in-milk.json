You sear a whole chicken in butter and a little oil, then dump out most of the fat and add cinnamon and garlic to the pot, along with a ton of lemon peel, sage leaves and a few cups of milk, then slide it into a hot oven to create one of the great dinners of all time. The milk breaks apart in the acidity and heat to become a ropy and fascinating sauce, and the garlic goes soft and sweet within it, its fragrance filigreed with the cinnamon and sage. The lemon meanwhile brightens all around it, and there is even a little bit of crispness to the skin, a textural miracle. It is the sort of meal you might cook once a month for a good long while and reminisce about for years.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/23/magazine/23eat/23mag-23eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chicken, garlic, lemon, milk, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2456}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 932, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "71 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "57 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "1442 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 to 4 pound) whole chicken", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "1/4 cup unsalted butter", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small cinnamon stick", "10 cloves garlic, skins left on", "2 1/2 cups whole milk", "1 handful of fresh sage, leaves picked \u2014 around 15 to 20 leaves", "2 lemons"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
