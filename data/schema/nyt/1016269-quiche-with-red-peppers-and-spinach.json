{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quiche With Red Peppers and Spinach", "description": "The real spring vegetable here is the spinach, lush and beautiful at this time of year. You can always get red peppers in a supermarket, and when you cook them for a while, as you do here, even the dullest will taste sweet. I make the pepper mixture first, then wilt the spinach in the same pan and line the tart shell with the savory mix. If you can, make the pepper and spinach filling a day ahead. It dries out a little if it sits overnight in the refrigerator and is less likely to dilute the custard.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/21/dining/Red-Peppers-and-Spinach/Red-Peppers-and-Spinach-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 generous servings", "recipeCuisine": "french, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "halal, high fiber, kosher, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 282}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 365, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "555 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium-size onion (yellow or spring onion), chopped", "2 large garlic cloves, or 1 small bulb green garlic, peeled and  minced", "Salt to taste", "2 large red bell peppers (about 3/4 pound), seeded and cut in thin 1-inch strips", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves", "1 generous bunch spinach, stemmed, washed in 2 changes of water, and coarsely chopped", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 egg yolks", "2 whole eggs", "1 (9-inch) <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016266-whole-wheat-pie-dough\">whole wheat p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e pie crust,</a> fully baked and cooled", "Freshly ground pepper", "2/3 cup milk", "2 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, grated (1/2 cup)", "1 ounce Parmesan, grated (1/4 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil over medium heat in a large, heavy skillet and add onion.
