They also make a delightfully creamy nut butter. Roasting the raw nuts before blending coaxes out the nuttiest flavor. Flax seeds, sesame seeds and poppy seeds are all great add-ins for crunch, but you could also stir in some tahini, which intensifies the flavor and adds even more creaminess.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/dining/kc-cashew-butter/merlin_153098937_dba7bb64-8186-43a5-bedc-cc4ebab24e44-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Makes 1 3/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "cashew, salt", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 232, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "5 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound raw cashews (about 3 cups)", "Kosher salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
