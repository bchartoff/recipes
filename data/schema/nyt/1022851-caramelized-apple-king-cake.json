{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Apple King Cake", "description": "Though there are many versions of king cake \u2014 the pastry eaten from Twelfth Night through Mardi Gras \u2014 many New Orleanians trace their best memories back to their local bakery. Such is the case for the Creole chef and New Orleans native Dominick Lee. His recipe was inspired by childhood memories of king cakes with apple filling served in the city\u2019s Gentilly neighborhood. Mr. Lee retains that filling in his cake and takes inspiration from global influences, adding a fragrant orange blossom cream-cheese frosting. True to tradition, a plastic baby is hidden within the cake. The person who finds and eats the slice with the baby is promised luck and prosperity, and \u2014 fair warning \u2014 is also responsible for providing the next cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kayla Stewart"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/05/dining/04KINGCAKEREX/merlin_199582518_c01765ae-60d5-494c-be98-a64ef03b51fc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 232}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 medium Granny Smith apples (340 grams/3/4 pound), peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch wedges", "1/2 packed cup/110 grams brown sugar", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 (1/4-ounce) packet active dry yeast (2 teaspoons)", "1/4 cup warm water", "3 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar\u00a0", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the bowl", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "1 cup/226 grams sour cream", "1 large egg", "3 cups/390 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "Egg wash (1 egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water), for brushing the dough", "1 plastic baby, for decorating", "4 ounces/113 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon orange blossom water", "3 cups/330 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream", "Purple, gold and green sparkling sugar or edible glitter sprinkles, for decorating"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the filling: Place the apples, brown sugar, flour, butter, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and 1/2 cup water in a large saucepan and stir well.
