Imagine a tamale made of green banana and root vegetable masa that is stuffed with savory meat or seafood, and then deep fried. You typically get them from the kioskos, roadside stands along Puerto Rico\u2019s beaches and highways, particularly in Lo\u00edza, a town on the northeastern coast that is the island\u2019s African heart</span>. At home, they\u2019re often made over the holidays, as many hands make light work. The flavor is unmistakable: earthy green banana and taro cut by savory <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022007-sofrito\">sofrito</a>, briny capers and delicate crab meat. The filling, often called a salmorejo, is usually made from local land crabs, but commercially available lump crab is a fitting substitute.
