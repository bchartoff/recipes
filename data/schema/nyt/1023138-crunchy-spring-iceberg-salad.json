{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy Spring Iceberg Salad", "description": "A big plate of greens may feel virtuous, but this one is also luxurious. This is a very green salad, with chunks of crisp iceberg lettuce serving as a bed for briefly blanched peas and asparagus, topped with a cooling-yet-spicy cilantro yogurt. Tearing the iceberg into bite-size chunks makes this an easy-to-eat salad, no knife required. It\u2019s particularly great for outdoor dining or for those who need to eat with one hand. (We see you, new parents.) The feta adds lovely hints of tang and saltiness that work well with the herbaceous yogurt. The peas and asparagus bring freshness; you could also use other springtime staples such as snow peas, sugar snap peas or sliced radish. Serve with jammy boiled eggs for something heartier.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/27/dining/hm-iceberg-salad/merlin_205522521_f65dde75-9410-49e7-bbff-5533e8380e8e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, salads and dressings, side dish", "keywords": "asparagus, feta, iceberg lettuce, healthy, vegetarian, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 400}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and black pepper\u00a0", "2 cups frozen peas", "16 to 20 asparagus spears, trimmed and sliced into 1-inch pieces (about 12 ounces)", "1 (1\u00bd-pound) medium head iceberg lettuce", "6 ounces feta, drained and broken into chunks", "Handful of cilantro leaves, for serving", "1 cup full-fat Greek yogurt", "1 cup chopped cilantro (leaves and tender stems from about \u00bd bunch)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Juice of \u00bd lemon or lime (1 to 2 tablespoons)", "1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 to 2 jalape\u00f1os or serrano chiles, trimmed and roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the salad: Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to the boil.
