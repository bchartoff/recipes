{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "English Pea and Onion Salad", "description": "Jonathon Sawyer is no snob. Although he runs the kitchens in a slew of acclaimed restaurants in the Cleveland area, including The Greenhouse Tavern, the chef decided to honor Thanksgiving and his home state, Ohio, by sending along a personal recipe that calls to mind the processed-food delights that, for decades, characterized the cooking of the Midwest. \u201cThink of this salad as a little slice of nostalgia from the canned-and-frozen households of the mid-20th century,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nMr. Sawyer recommends frozen peas (\u201cI think frozen peas are magical,\u201d he said) and organic eggs, but over the years he has seen the dish made with Miracle Whip, cubes of cheese from the deli, powdered Ranch dressing, French\u2019s fried onions. \u201cThe real goal of having a salad like this on the holiday table is it\u2019s a tart, sweet and delicious break from the overindulgence of roasted birds, velvety gravy and buttery potatoes,\u201d he said. And hey, that break from the overindulgence happens to have bacon in it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19OHIO/19OHIO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "bacon, onion, peas, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 301, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "419 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ounces slab bacon, cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "2 lemons, zested and juiced", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small onion, diced and rinsed under cold water", "3 tablespoons mayonnaise", "4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese", "4 tablespoons mixed chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, mint, tarragon and basil", "2 large eggs, hard-cooked and finely diced", "Salt and pepper", "2 cups fresh or thawed frozen peas", "2 tablespoons sliced almonds, toasted", "2 tablespoons bread crumbs, toasted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with foil.
