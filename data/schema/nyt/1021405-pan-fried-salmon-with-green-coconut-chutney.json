{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Fried Salmon With Green-Coconut Chutney", "description": "Coastal flavors from India permeate this crispy-skin salmon. The coconut chutney carries the buzz of ginger and green chile, while a drizzle of tadka \u2014 a hot, bright red oil infused with mustard seeds, curry leaves and Aleppo flakes \u2014 is the crowning glory of the dish. For perfectly crisp skin, resist the urge to fidget with the fish until the appropriate amount of time has passed; the skin will start to crisp at the edges and the fillet will release with ease. Use fresh or frozen coconut to make the chutney. (Desiccated coconut simply doesn\u2019t work as well here.) You can use freeze-dried curry leaves instead of fresh, but you might need to double or even triple the amount, as their intensity is noticeably weaker in comparison.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/02/dining/ns-pan-fried-salmon-with-green-coconut-chutney/merlin_175270404_c5e83ae4-8444-4f91-9816-e80df052fc9b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, coconut, curry leaves, ghee, ginger, mustard seed, salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 162}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup packed fresh or frozen (thawed) grated coconut", "1 cup packed cilantro stems and leaves", "1 fresh, hot green chile, such as a serrano or Thai chile, stemmed", "2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "Kosher salt", "2 skin-on salmon fillets (about 6 ounces each)", "1 tablespoon ghee or unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "1 teaspoon black or brown mustard seeds", "10 to 12 fresh curry leaves (or 25 to 36 dried curry leaves)", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, such Maras, Urfa or Aleppo"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chutney: In a food processor, blend the coconut, cilantro, chile, ginger and lime juice with 2 to 3 tablespoons of water for a couple of seconds to get a coarse mixture.
