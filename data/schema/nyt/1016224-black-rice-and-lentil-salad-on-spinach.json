{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Rice and Lentil Salad on Spinach", "description": "Black rice is inky, as black as squid ink, and glistens against a bed of spinach. The pigments provide anthocyanins, flavonoids that are high in antioxidants. I was inspired to cook the rice with lentils by a pilaf that I ate recently at the \u201cHealthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives\u201d conference at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley. In addition to the familiar green or black lentils, I\u2019ve thrown in uncooked split red lentils, which  contribute their own soft salmon color and crunch; they are soaked for a few hours to soften them, and  that\u2019s all they need. Prepare the ingredients for the salad while the rice and lentils are cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/05/science/11recipehealth/11recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 56}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 329, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "585 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup black rice", "1/2 cups black (beluga) or green lentils, washed and picked over", "2 3/4 cups water", "Salt to taste", "2 to 3 garlic cloves (to taste), minced", "1/3 cup olive oil", "1 teaspoon freshly ground cumin seeds", "3/4 teaspoon freshly ground coriander seeds", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground cardamom seeds", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/4 cup chopped fresh mint or parsley, or a combination", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "1/4 cup chopped dill", "1/4 cup chopped chives or green onions", "1/4 cup soaked split red lentils", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 bunch spinach, stemmed, washed thoroughly in 2 changes water and dried, or 1 bag baby spinach, rinsed and dried", "4 or 5 radishes, sliced, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse rice and green or black lentils and combine in a medium saucepan with 2 3/4 cups water or enough to cover by 1 inch.
