{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kalleh Gonjeshki (Meatballs and Potatoes)\u00a0", "description": "Kalleh gonjeshki is a comforting and nostalgic Iranian dish that, at its core, is a simple preparation of meatballs and potatoes simmered in a tomatoey sauce. Kalleh gonjeshki means \u201csparrow\u2019s head\u201d in Persian, and the name is a reference to the size of the meatballs. Every family has its own version of this childhood favorite, and the dish hits the spot on cooler evenings. Don\u2019t replace the dried mint in the meatball mixture with fresh mint, as the dried mint contributes earthier notes and provides more flavor and fragrance. To cut down on time and pans, the meatballs are first baked in the oven, but you can also pan-fry them on the stovetop if you like. Kalleh gonjsheki is served with a side of bread, but you can also serve it alongside rice.\u00a0\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/11/dining/nd-meatballs-and-potatoes/merlin_199949079_43f298f5-d1d6-4c59-a1e6-b463e12320c6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "meatballs", "keywords": "dried mint, ground beef", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 347}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground beef or lamb, or combination", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon dried mint, crushed between your fingers (optional)", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric\u00a0", "1 small yellow onion, grated on the largest hole of a box grater", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper\u00a0", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 large Yukon Gold potato (about 8 ounces), peeled and diced into 1/2-inch cubes", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 425 degrees.
