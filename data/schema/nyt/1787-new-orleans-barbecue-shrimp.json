{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp", "description": "Barbecue shrimp is an old New Orleans recipe that has nothing to do with barbecue or with grilling. Its name comes from the spicy, smoky flavor the shrimp derive from being cooked with Worcestershire sauce and lots of black pepper. It is a fine and almost absurdly fast dish \u2014 once the shrimp are peeled, you can have it on the table in 10 minutes \u2014 with a rich, savory sauce that completely belies the little effort it takes. But as I discovered once I started playing around with it, the key ingredient is neither Worcestershire sauce nor pepper, but rather butter. If you start with about a tablespoon for each serving of shrimp, you can add almost any flavor you like and create a sauce with the same creaminess and rich flavor. But start with Worcestershire sauce and pepper!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/05/dining/31COOKING-BBQ-SHRIMP2/31COOKING-BBQ-SHRIMP2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "black pepper, shrimp, worcestershire sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 276}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 253, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1565 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds peeled shrimp", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire or soy sauce", "Salt to taste", "1/2 teaspoon or more fresh black pepper", "Juice of 1 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put butter in skillet, and turn heat to high; when it melts, add garlic, shrimp and Worcestershire or soy sauce.
