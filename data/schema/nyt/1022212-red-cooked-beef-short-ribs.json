The version Jennifer Hwa Dobbertin and Quealy Watson serve at <a href=\"https://www.bestqualitydaughter.com/\">Best Quality Daughter</a>, their restaurant in San Antonio, turbocharges that formula. Dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns bring fire and tingle, and star anise and cinnamon provide warmth. There\u2019s a whisper of orange, a bite of ginger. Tomato paste and doubanjiang, a fermented chile bean paste, offer depth. Do take the time to use some of the braising liquid to serve as the base for the finishing glaze, thick and glossy as demi-glace. It\u2019s worth it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/16/magazine/16mag-eat/16mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, asian", "recipeCategory": "meat, main course", "keywords": "ginger, rice wine, short ribs, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 332}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola", "5 pounds bone-in short ribs, at least 1 1/2 inches thick", "1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into thick slices", "2 cinnamon sticks", "8 dried Chinese chiles", "4 pieces dried orange peel (or fresh orange peel with no pith, well toasted)", "3 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns, toasted, then crushed or ground (about 2 tablespoons)", "2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns", "2 whole star anise", "1 cup Shaoxing rice wine", "1 1/2 cups low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 cup dark soy sauce", "1 packed cup light or dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon molasses", "3 cups chicken stock", "3 cups braising liquid from the ribs", "2 medium white onions, peeled and thinly sliced", "1/4 cup tomato paste", "1/4 cup doubanjiang", "1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 cup Shaoxing rice wine", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into thick slices", "5 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "1 teaspoon five-spice powder", "3 tablespoons cornstarch", "Bibb lettuce leaves", "Thai basil, chopped cilantro and sliced scallions", "Sliced cucumbers", "Cooked white rice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees.
