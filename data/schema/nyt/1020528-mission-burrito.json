{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mission Burrito", "description": "To find the best burritos in San Francisco, you have to go to the Mission District, a historic Latin American neighborhood known for its vibrant culture and food. There are many places there to get a good burrito, but La Taqueria, which won a James Beard Award in 2017, is a favorite. Miguel Jara, who emigrated to the United States from Mexico, opened the restaurant in 1973 because he missed the cuisine of his home country. Mission burritos are known for their giant size (about eight inches long), and are packed with a hearty serving of meat, beans, salsa verde, pico de gallo, cheese, avocado and sour cream. Most Mission burritos include rice as well, but Mr. Jara believes it takes away from the flavors of the meat. No garnish is necessary, but the aluminum foil wrapper is required: No real Mission burrito is served without it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kiera Wright-Ruiz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/dining/kwr-mission-burrito/kwr-mission-burrito-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 burritos", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burritos and nachos, meat, steaks and chops", "keywords": "beer, monterey jack cheese, pinto beans, steak, tortilla, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 166}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound top sirloin steak", "1 (12-ounce) can Tecate beer", "Kosher salt", "5 tablespoons pork lard or 3 tablespoons neutral oil (such as canola or vegetable oil), plus more for searing the burritos, if desired", "3 tablespoons pork lard (optional)", "1 (15-ounce) can pinto beans, drained (about 1 1/3 cups beans)", "Kosher salt", "4 burrito-size (9- to 10-inch) flour tortillas", "1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese", "1 cup finely chopped homemade or store-bought pico de gallo", "1/4 cup salsa verde", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1 avocado, mashed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut steak in half crosswise.
