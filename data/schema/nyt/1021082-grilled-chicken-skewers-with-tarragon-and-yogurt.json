{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Chicken Skewers With Tarragon and Yogurt", "description": "These grilled chicken skewers are gently spiced with a ginger-and-cumin yogurt marinade, which makes the meat exceedingly tender and cooks to fragrant curds. As they grill, the skewers are gilded with a tarragon-mint baste that tastes distinctly Persian. Restraint and a very hot grill are both key to getting a good char: Don\u2019t move the skewers until the yogurt is burnished and the meat releases from the grates. Color is flavor. Catch any juices that run out of the cooked skewers with warm pita bread. Leftovers make excellent chicken salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clare de Boer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/dining/18chickenrex2/18chickenrex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, skewers and kebabs, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, greek yogurt, grilled chicken, lime juice, mint, pita, tarragon, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2060}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "8 scallions, trimmed", "6 pita breads", "2 1/2 cups full-fat Greek yogurt", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 limes)", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 garlic clove, crushed", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated", "2 teaspoons roasted cumin seeds, bruised using a mortar and pestle", "1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 1 lime), plus 4 lime wedges for serving", "1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon, mint or both, plus more torn herbs for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chicken: Cut each thigh in half against the grain.
