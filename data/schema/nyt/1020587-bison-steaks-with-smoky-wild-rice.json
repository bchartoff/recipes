{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bison Steaks with Smoky Wild Rice", "description": "I seared a couple of boneless bison strip loin steaks in a cast-iron skillet, which gave me pan juices so I could produce a bit of intense sauce to drizzle on the meat. Because bison has a slightly sweeter finish than beef, I combined a tart pomegranate molasses with red wine for deglazing. A few dollops of good butter compensated for the leanness of the meat and turned the pan juices into a dark, syrupy finishing sauce. Bison is less marbled than beef cuts like rib roast, rib-eye or strip loin, so it should be cooked no more than medium-rare. Alongside the bison I served a wild rice pilaf infused with double-smoked bacon, rendered fragrant with ground cloves and steeped in beef stock that had been sharpened with a little of the pomegranate molasses.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": ""}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat", "keywords": "bacon, bison, clove, dry red wine, pomegranate molasses, red onion, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "3 ounces double-smoked slab bacon, diced", "1/2 cup red onion, finely diced", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 cup wild rice", "2 1/2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses", "2 1/2 cups beef stock", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 boneless bison strip loin steaks, well trimmed, each about 10 ounces", "3/4 cup dry red wine", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, preferably high-fat"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a 3-quart saucepan.
