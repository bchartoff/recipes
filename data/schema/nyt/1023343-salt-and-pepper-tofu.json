{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salt and Pepper Tofu", "description": "The joy of Chinese salt and pepper tofu is the contrasting crispy-on-the-outside, pillowy-on-the-inside textures. There is no need to press the tofu \u2014 a quick pat down with a kitchen towel is all that\u2019s needed \u2014 as the moisture actually helps to keep the interior soft and tender. While potato or tapioca starch is often used for a light batter, nothing beats the accessibility and affordability of cornstarch to produce an enviable crunch. There are many versions of salt and pepper seasoning in Chinese cuisine \u2014 some contain Sichuan peppercorns or fennel seeds \u2014 but in this recipe, a spicy-sweet combination of white pepper, sugar, ground ginger and five-spice powder shines (See Tip).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/19/dining/hm-salt-and-pepper-tofu/merlin_209335443_68354d62-e10a-48d3-86bc-5b5e6d2fcdf6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "salt, tofu, white pepper, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 361}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper", "1/2 teaspoon <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021925-five-spice\">five-spice powder</a>", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 (14-ounce) package firm tofu, drained", "1/2 cup cornstarch", "Neutral oil such as canola or grapeseed", "2 scallions, trimmed and finely sliced", "1 long red pepper (such as Fresno) or long green pepper (such as jalape\u00f1o or serrano), thinly sliced", "Cooked rice, to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the seasoning, combine the salt, sugar, white pepper, five-spice powder and ground ginger in a small bowl, and stir to combine.
