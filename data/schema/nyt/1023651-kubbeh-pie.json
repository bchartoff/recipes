Usually made of a bulgur-based shell with a meat, onion and nut filling, the Levantine croquettes are a staple in any feast or spread and a prominent feature on Arab holiday tables across the U.S. The pie form is a substantially easier version that captures all the delicious flavors in a main dish, without requiring shaping individual parcels or deep frying. A garlicky spread like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016438-tzatziki\">tzatziki</a> or tahini sauce (recipe below) provides the perfect fresh contrast to the kubbeh\u2019s warm, earthy flavors.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Reem Kassis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/14/multimedia/07kubbehrex2-kubbeh-pie-1-6b92/07kubbehrex2-kubbeh-pie-1-6b92-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings (or 12 to 16, if part of a spread)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course, side dish", "keywords": "allspice, beef top round, bulgur, ground beef, ground cinnamon, ground cumin, make-ahead, pine nut, project, tahini, walnut, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 ounces extra-lean beef (round cuts such as eye, top and bottom round, or top sirloin or tip all work), trimmed of any fat, gristle or silver skin, and cut into cubes", "1 3/4 cups extrafine (No. 1) bulgur (see Tip)\u00a0", "1 small yellow onion, quartered", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Melted ghee or olive oil, for greasing and baking\u00a0", "Slivered almonds or pine nuts (optional), to garnish", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnut pieces", "1/4 cup pine nuts\u00a0", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 medium or 1 large yellow onion, finely diced (about 2 cups)", "1 pound ground beef", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup tahini", "1/4 cup lemon juice", "1/4 cup plain yogurt", "1/2 teaspoon sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

If using a round dish, you can do diamonds or divide the circle into quarters or eighths then do a diamond pattern within each triangle. Once you have created your pattern, cut all the way through the bottom of the kubbeh along the lines that you want each serving size to be, whether you want smaller portions for an appetizer or larger portions for a main.
