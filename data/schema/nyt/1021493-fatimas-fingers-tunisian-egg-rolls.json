They are commonly eaten to break the fast during Ramadan, but are also enjoyed year round, especially at weddings. While this particular recipe is Tunisian, many North African and Middle Eastern countries have their own versions. They are typically made with thin, delicate malsouka pastry sheets, but spring roll wrappers are used here instead. The fillings are wide-ranging (you may find versions with tuna, shrimp, ground beef or vegetables) and flexible: Feel free to omit the chicken in this recipe for a tasty vegetarian snack.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jamel Charouel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/08/dining/jg-tunisian-chicken-roll/merlin_177922671_055cf300-eea2-406b-8aea-2188485ea667-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, pastries, poultry, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "chicken, chicken breast, lemon, mozzarella, potato, spring roll wrappers, turmeric, ramadan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 92}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 8 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1/2 small yellow onion, cut into 1/4-inch pieces", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1/2 teaspoon ras el hanout", "1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "2 small white potatoes (about 6 ounces total), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 eggs", "1 cup shredded mozzarella (about 4 ounces)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley", "12 square spring roll wrappers", "1 egg, beaten for egg wash", "About 2 cups vegetable or canola oil, for frying", "1 fresh lemon, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat.\u00a0Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high.
