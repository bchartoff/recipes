Wash the leeks vigorously under slow-running cold water, using your hands and fingers to scrape away insistent dirt and sand. Arrange them on a cutting board, and in one confident move, stab the tip of a sharp chef\u2019s knife into the leek 1/2 inch from the root end, and run it the rest of the length to the green top, in essence cleaving the leek starting from the white pale root, making two legs and a crotch, where only one thick column was to start.

Barely cover leeks with water, leaving them, as we often say, bobbing in the water like crocodiles submerged at the river\u2019s edge. Season with salt, and scatter with the black peppercorns. Cover with parchment, being sure that the parchment is tucked in around all the edges of your casserole dish. Add a few spoonfuls of water evenly on top of the parchment \u2014 allowing the weight of the water to help hold down the parchment, which will start to dome from heat and condensation once the cooking starts. Bring the water to a gentle simmer, and hold it there until the leeks are tender without being mushy, with no raw, crunchy quality at all. The color will be drab on the exterior and still attractive halcyon at the centers. This may take 10 minutes, or even 20; you have to watch them."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the leeks from the water with a slotted spoon, and transfer to a clean rack, draining all of their cooking water.

Cut into quarters on a bias, and arrange attractively on a serving platter."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the vinaigrette, place the grated garlic, mustard and red wine vinegar in bowl.
