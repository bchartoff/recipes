If you don\u2019t eat salt, then just rinse the shrimp with plain water. I recommend bunch spinach for this; you don\u2019t have to stem it, just cut away the base of the leaves and rinse well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/13/health/nutrition/13recipehealth/13recipehealth-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, nut-free, main course, shrimp, spinach, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1085}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 219, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "733 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined", "Salt to taste", "1/8 teaspoon sugar", "2 tablespoons canola oil or light sesame oil", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried red chili", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds", "1 generous bunch spinach (about 1 pound), stems trimmed at the end, rinsed in 2 changes water", "2 teaspoons dark sesame oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the shrimp in a large colander and rinse with water.
