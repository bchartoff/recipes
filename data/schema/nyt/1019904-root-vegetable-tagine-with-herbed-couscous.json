{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Root Vegetable Tagine With Herbed Couscous", "description": "A pot of warm, fragrant root vegetables spooned over bright, lemony couscous is as good as gold on a winter day. Studded with chickpeas, raisins and meaty morsels of stewed tomatoes, this dish balances traditional tagine spices \u2014 cinnamon, coriander and turmeric \u2014 with a bright boost of ginger and lemon. Given a little time on the stove for the flavors to deepen and the vegetables to turn spoon-tender, this tagine is a worthwhile investment. Double it for a week of leftovers. You don\u2019t need a traditional terracotta tagine to pull this dish off. A Dutch oven mimics the same high heat conduction and similarly traps steam to keep the vegetables tender and moist, and bathed in flavor from the broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/14/dining/sc-root-vegetable-tagine/sc-root-vegetable-tagine-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "butternut squash, carrot, chickpeas, cinnamon stick, couscous, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 53}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large white or yellow onion, roughly chopped", "Kosher salt\u00a0", "3 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "2 cups vegetable stock", "1 medium butternut squash (about 2 1/4 pounds), peeled and cut into bite-size pieces", "4 small carrots, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, with their juices, tomatoes roughly chopped", "1 lemon, peel removed in strips with a vegetable peeler and reserved, remaining lemon cut into wedges", "1 (14-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1/3 cup golden or brown raisins", "1 tablespoon honey", "Black pepper", "Fresh pomegranate seeds, for garnish", "Roughly chopped parsley or cilantro leaves, for garnish", "2 1/2 cups vegetable stock", "2 1/4 cups whole-wheat couscous\u00a0(14 ounces)", "Zest from 1 lemon", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "1 packed cup chopped parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
