{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Borani-yeh Esfenaj (Spinach Yogurt Dip)", "description": "There are many types of Iranian borani, or yogurt-based dishes, and spinach borani is a classic. What sets borani-yeh esfenaj apart from a simple mix of wilted spinach and yogurt is that the spinach is first cooked down with flavorful golden onions, garlic and turmeric. The preparation of the onion is the backbone of the dish and not to be overlooked. Rather than cooking the onion low and slow, as is done when caramelizing, it\u2019s cooked quickly over a higher heat to draw out its sweet and sharp flavors. Creamy Greek yogurt is mixed with thinner regular yogurt for a balanced consistency. Use more or less of either depending on your preference: You can serve the borani thicker as a dip with pita crackers or flat breads, or thinner as a light lunch or snack alongside rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/26/dining/nd-Borani-yeh-Esfenaj/merlin_206153493_0b010147-160c-45f4-82bd-d3622d27f4c5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H35M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "snack, dips and spreads, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "baby spinach, greek yogurt, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 407}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped", "2 large garlic cloves, finely grated", "Salt and black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "12 ounces fresh baby spinach, or thawed frozen spinach (no need to squeeze)", "1 cup plain Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon regular plain yogurt (or water; see Tip), plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest and 1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus more juice to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) pan, heat the oil over medium-high.
