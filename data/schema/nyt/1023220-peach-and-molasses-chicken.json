{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach and Molasses Chicken", "description": "The sauce here relies on store-bought jam as a shortcut to intense fruit flavor and it is amazing on chicken. This recipe, adapted from the cookbook \u201cWatermelon and Red Birds\u201d by Nicole Taylor, is special enough for your Juneteenth celebration, but it\u2019s so delicious, it can be cooked on a weekly rotation. Almost any fruit jam works, too, if peach isn\u2019t your thing. As for the chicken itself, so much of the fat and flavor comes from the chicken skin that removing that outer layer is tantamount to robbing the meat of most of its taste, so do what it takes to find skin-on pieces. The crispy, charred chicken edges, drenched with the sauce, only happen with skin attached.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nicole Taylor"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/08/dining/06JuneteenthREX2-Peach-Molasses-Chicken/merlin_207642084_f8a187df-fd19-4932-b435-b0ff8517faad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, barbecues, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, coriander seeds, molasses, peach jam, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 861}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup peach jam\u00a0", "1/4 cup unsulfured molasses", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds, crushed\u00a0", "1 tablespoon ground mustard", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "3 to 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "1\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "\u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1\u00bd tablespoons peanut oil", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds, crushed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the peach jam, molasses, vinegar and 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to combine.
