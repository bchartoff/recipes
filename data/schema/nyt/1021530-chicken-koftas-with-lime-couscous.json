{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Koftas With Lime Couscous", "description": "This splendid yet easy meal pairs koftas (gently spiced meatballs) and couscous with fresh accents from herbs, limes and crunchy pine nuts. Using a food processor to blitz all the kofta ingredients provides enough friction to help the meat proteins bind and form a much nicer and compact kofta. A similar technique is traditionally employed in India, where ground meat is chopped until it becomes a paste. While the sweet and tart taste of dried cherries are nice here, cranberries are an excellent substitute, bringing a similar spot of brightness to this dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/05/dining/ns-chicken-kebabs/ns-chicken-kebabs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry, main course", "keywords": "cherries, couscous, ginger, ground chicken, parsley", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1170}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken stock", "2 tablespoons lime juice, plus 1/2 teaspoon lime zest", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, such as Aleppo", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup couscous", "1/4 loosely packed cup\u00a0chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1/4 cup dried sweet-tart cherries or cranberries", "3 tablespoons toasted pine nuts", "1 pound ground chicken or turkey", "2 shallots, peeled and minced", "1 large egg, lightly whisked", "2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1 serrano chile, trimmed and chopped", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "2 tablespoons peeled and grated fresh ginger", "Fine sea salt and\u00a0freshly ground black pepper", "Olive oil", "1 lime, cut into wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the couscous: In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the stock, lime juice, olive oil, red-pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon salt to a rolling boil.
