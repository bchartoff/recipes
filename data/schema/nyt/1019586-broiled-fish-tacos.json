Put your broiler to work, and make them an easy weekly affair. Paprika and coriander give meaty white fish like mahi-mahi or halibut tons of impact, but the real star here is the lime-laced herb salad, which makes every bite pop. Make sure to start with the best corn tortillas you can find. And don't worry about loading the tacos up with cabbage and pico de gallo: There\u2019s no need here. These are at their best (and easiest) when they're pared down.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/dining/sc-mahi/sc-mahi-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weekday, weeknight, tacos", "keywords": "cilantro, halibut, lime, mahi-mahi, mint, tortilla, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 259}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 397, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "416 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 limes", "1/4 cup grapeseed or canola\u00a0oil", "1 packed cup cilantro leaves, chopped (from about half a bunch)", "1 packed cup fresh mint, parsley or basil leaves, or a combination, chopped", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "4 boneless mahi-mahi or halibut fillets, about 6 ounces each", "8 corn tortillas", "Mexican crema or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Finely zest the limes into a medium bowl.
