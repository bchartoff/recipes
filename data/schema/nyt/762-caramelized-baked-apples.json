With a vegetable peeler, peel the tops and bottoms of each apple, leaving a band of skin approximately two inches wide. Place the apples one to two inches apart in a large baking dish.

Stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar has dissolved. When the sugar begins to turn golden, rotate the pan to even the color. When the caramel is light amber, using a wooden spoon, carefully coat each apple with the hot caramel. (Caramel burns quickly and must be watched carefully. It will continue to cook and become a darker amber as you are working with it.) Repeat the method with the remaining sugar, using a clean, cool, medium-size heavy saucepan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, whip the cream into soft peaks and fold in the ginger and refrigerate until ready to serve the apples."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When ready to serve, pry the apples from the baking pans with a metal spatula and arrange them on a serving platter or serve on individual dessert plates, accompanied with the ginger cream."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/762-caramelized-baked-apples"}
