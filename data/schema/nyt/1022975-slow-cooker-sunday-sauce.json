{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Sunday Sauce", "description": "Whether it\u2019s called red sauce, sugo or gravy, you\u2019ll find a big pot of the rich tomato sauce simmering all Sunday long in many Italian-American households. Every family has their own version, but this recipe includes shreddy pork shoulder, sausage and meatballs. This slow-cooker version lets you simmer it overnight or while you\u2019re not home, and without splatters and stirring (though you can also <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022972-sunday-sauce\">make it on a stovetop</a>). Once the sauce is done, coat pasta in the sauce, spoon the meats on top and serve it with a green salad, crusty bread and red wine. Sauce can be kept refrigerated for up to one week and frozen for up to three months.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/08/dining/as-slow-cooker-sunday-sauce/merlin_201239007_e63c53be-159f-43d0-89fb-aa01e1331790-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas, sauces and gravies, main course", "keywords": "crushed canned tomatoes, italian american, pork shoulder, sausage, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1200}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes", "3 basil sprigs", "2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 3-inch chunks", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 pound hot or sweet Italian sausage, or a combination", "1 yellow onion, coarsely chopped", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1/3 cup red wine", "1 pound uncooked <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019765-pork-and-ricotta-meatballs\">homemade</a> or store-bought meatballs", "1 1/2 pounds tubular or long noodles, like rigatoni or spaghetti", "Grated Parmesan or pecorino, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, add the crushed tomatoes and basil sprigs.
