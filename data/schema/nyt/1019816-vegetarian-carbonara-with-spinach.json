{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian \u2018Carbonara\u2019 With Spinach", "description": "This spinach-laden carbonara deviates from the standard by nixing two of its leading ingredients: custardy egg yolks, which create its silky texture, and cured meat, which delivers its salty punch. This egg-free version uses a combination of butter and starchy pasta cooking water to give the sauce body. A sprinkle of grated smoked Provolone or Gouda adds a bit of the earthy flavor that traditionally comes from guanciale or pancetta. The final coup? Adding greens: One entire pound of baby spinach may look like a gargantuan amount, but it wilts right into the pasta. Most importantly, don\u2019t be shy with the black pepper: It adds a necessary dose of spice and heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/dining/Spinach-Spaghetti-Carbonara/Spinach-Spaghetti-Carbonara-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, pastas", "keywords": "baby spinach, gouda cheese, parmesan, provolone, spaghetti, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 973}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 719, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "95 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "746 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup finely chopped onion", "5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "1 pound spaghetti", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 pound fresh baby spinach", "Red-pepper flakes, to taste (optional)", "3/4 cup grated Parmesan (2 1/2 ounces)", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 cup grated smoked Provolone or Gouda (1 1/2 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
