{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach Salad with Prosciutto and Persimmon", "description": "This colorful salad, a mix of spinach, sweet persimmon, prosciutto and plenty of Parmesan-laced croutons, is satisfying enough for a light dinner. Or serve it as a somewhat unusual first course. Make sure to add enough oil and vinegar at the end to just coat the spinach, but not weigh the leaves down. The croutons can be made the day before; store them in an airtight container at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/02/multimedia/clark-spinach-salad/clark-spinach-salad-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday", "keywords": "main course, side dish, parmesan, persimmon, prosciutto, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 36}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 308, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "986 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more to taste", "2 garlic cloves, crushed and peeled", "2 cups cubed, day-old bread, preferably from a crusty, whole-wheat or sourdough loaf", "2/3 cup coarsely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, more to taste", "2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, more to taste", "2 quarts fresh spinach", "3 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, torn into strips", "1 firm fuyu persimmon, trimmed, quartered and thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
