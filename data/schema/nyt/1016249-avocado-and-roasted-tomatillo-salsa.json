{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Avocado and Roasted Tomatillo Salsa", "description": "I have been making tomatillo and avocado salsa for years, but I usually simmer the tomatillos rather than roasting them. Roasting the tomatillos, chiles and garlic \u2013 toasting really, as I use a skillet for this, on top of the flame \u2013  produces a salsa with a delicious charred flavor. I learned something recently from the chef Iliana de la Vega, who demonstrated the recipe at the \u201cHealthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives\u201d conference in Napa Valley in March: she says, in no uncertain terms, that you should not add water to tomatillo salsas. Without the water, this is a more intense salsa with pleasing density.You can use it as a sauce to serve with chicken or fish, or as a dip with chips or other vegetables.\n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups, serving 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "appetizer, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low-carb, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 53}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 61, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "202 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound tomatillos, husked", "1 to 2 serrano chiles (to taste), stems removed ", "1 medium garlic clove, unpeeled  ", "1 slice white or red onion", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro, with stems", "1 medium avocado", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a heavy cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.
