At ballgames, carnivals or bowling alleys you can expect a pile of limp tortilla chips, drowned in warm yellow cheese product.

Here is avocado; there, the awesome funk of chopped cilantro.\n\nWant some bacon on there as well, or a slash of hot sauce? Go to! Some will add beans. Others black olives, chopped raw onion. Please do.\n\nBut take care to layer well.
