As with any sturdy greens, the raw sprouts benefit from marinating in the dressing, which uses fresh lemon juice and salt as tenderizers. While the uncooked greens can be prepared in advance, you\u2019ll want to add the warm ingredients just before serving, so you can enjoy the contrast of the crisp leaves and toasted almonds with the tangy shredded sprouts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/dining/ss-brussels-sprouts-salad/ss-brussels-sprouts-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "almond, brussels sprouts, lemon juice, pecorino, shallot, fall, spring, winter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 211}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound or 2 (9-ounce) containers brussels sprouts", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 small shallot, halved", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup", "Black pepper", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 ounces Pecorino Sardo, or other sharp sheep\u2019s milk cheese, shaved with a vegetable peeler (about 1 scant cup)", "1/3 cup whole raw almonds, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the sprouts, cutting a good 1/4-inch off the bottom.
