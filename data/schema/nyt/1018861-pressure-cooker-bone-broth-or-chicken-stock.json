{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Bone Broth or Chicken Stock", "description": "The difference between bone broth and regular broth, or stock, comes down to the length of the cooking time and the addition of acid to the cooking liquid. They taste very similar, though the bone broth has a slightly more intense flavor and a thicker, silkier texture. They can be used interchangeably in recipes. Really, the main difference is that many people consider bone broth to be therapeutic: The longer cooking time of a bone broth allows the collagen and minerals from the bones and connective tissue to dissolve into the liquid.\n\n\n<i>This is one of <a href=\"/68861692/7716592-melissa-clark-dinner-in-an-instant\">10 recipes</a> from Melissa Clark\u2019s \u201cDinner in an Instant: 75 Modern Recipes for Your Pressure Cooker, Multicooker, and Instant Pot\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2017).</i>\n\n<i>Melissa Clark\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562277/dinner-in-an-instant-by-melissa-clark/9781524762964/\">\u201cDinner in an Instant\u201d</a> is available everywhere books are sold. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Instant-Recipes-Pressure-Multicooker-ebook/dp/B06XK41BQV/?tag=NYTBks-20&ascsubtag=dinnerinstant\">Order your copy today.</a></i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/25/dining/bonebrothchickenstock/bonebrothchickenstock-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookbook exclusive, soups and stews", "keywords": "bones, garlic, parsley, thyme, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 250}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 482, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "147 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds bones, preferably a mix of meaty bones and marrow-filled bones", "3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "1 1/2 tablespoons coarse sea salt, or to taste", "1 to 2 celery stalks", "1 large carrot", "1 large onion, 2 leeks, or a bunch of leek greens", "1 whole clove or star anise pod", "2 to 6 garlic cloves", "5 to 7 sprigs fresh thyme or dill", "5 to 7 sprigs fresh parsley", "1 bay leaf", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "2 to 4 1-inch-thick coins peeled fresh ginger (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If you want to roast the bones first, heat the oven to 450\u00baF.
