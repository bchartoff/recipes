{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp, Cilantro and Tamarind Soup", "description": "Goan cuisine is known for its bold use of sourness, heat and spices. Seafood occupies an important position in Goan food, and, in this shrimp soup, tamarind is used to provide sourness while chiles provide heat. Here, the raw shrimp are cooked slowly over low heat, helping the stock to develop its rich savoriness. But the method also works spectacularly with frozen shrimp, and you can use shrimp with their tails left on, if you prefer. Whatever you do, be sure to avoid using those thick, syrupy tamarind concentrates. They lack tamarind's fruity flavor and carry a noticeable artificial aftertaste. Serve with toasted slices of lightly buttered bread to finish off any remaining liquid in the soup bowl.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10tamarindrex1-soup/merlin_174770199_d5c19577-5baa-42b6-b1ab-8e5a2aceeab0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, seafood, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, shrimp, tamarind paste, tomato paste", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 269}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large raw shrimp, fresh or frozen, shelled and deveined", "4 cups warm water", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small yellow or white onion, peeled and finely minced", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and grated", "1/4 cup tomato paste", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 tablespoon <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021264-tamarind-paste\">tamarind paste</a> (not concentrate)", "Kosher salt", "1 bunch cilantro, leaves and stems minced", "1 green chile, such as serrano or Thai chile, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the shrimp and the water in a medium saucepan.
