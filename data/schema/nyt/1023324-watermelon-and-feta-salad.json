Unassumingly simple, the sweet melon, salty cheese and fragrant basil reach their peak when doused with white balsamic vinegar and dribbled with fruity olive oil. Rather than building tall, this salad builds wide \u2014 so use a large platter for the most dramatic presentation. Vinegared watermelon does not keep its crisp, juicy texture well, so be sure to dress it (and eat it) the moment the last basil leaf falls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/EK-Watermelon-Basil-and-Feta-Salad-15SALADREX/merlin_209704119_f9158d29-c12e-481d-a90a-ff467c692127-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, weeknight, salads and dressings, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "basil, feta, watermelon, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 248}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds seedless watermelon (without rinds), thinly sliced into large, irregular pieces\u00a0", "2 tablespoons white or red balsamic vinegar", "Salt", "1 (6-ounce) block Greek feta, thinly sliced into large, irregular pieces", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Leaves from 1 sprig basil, larger leaves torn"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a large platter, arrange the watermelon and douse with the vinegar.
