{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beer Brats", "description": "Fans of Midwestern-style beer brats have strong opinions about the best way to prepare them. Some like to simmer the bratwurst in beer before browning them on the grill (as is the case here); some prefer grilling first, soaking in beer after. But everyone agrees that the brats should start out fresh and uncooked (rather than precooked, like hot dogs), then be served on a split, toasted roll with onions and plenty of mustard. Purists may shun adding the likes of ketchup, pickles and sauerkraut to the sandwich, but when you\u2019re the cook, you get to choose which condiments to put out \u2014 or set aside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/30/multimedia/30summer-gallagher-brats-2/merlin_187538331_4bbf8d21-2585-496d-a757-1c35d73e12a4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "sausages, main course", "keywords": "beer, bratwurst, onion, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 481}, "recipeIngredient": ["24 ounces lager or pilsner beer (2 cans or bottles)", "2 medium onions, halved and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "6 uncooked bratwurst sausages", "6 bratwurst rolls or hoagie rolls, split", "Spicy brown or yellow mustard, for serving", "Pickles and ketchup, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Light a charcoal grill or heat a gas grill to high."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot over high heat, bring beer and half the onions to a simmer (save remaining onions for serving).
