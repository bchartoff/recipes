If you\u2019d like to dress them up for a party, start by adding 2 tablespoons of finely chopped chocolate to the chocolate batter before scooping it into the cups and skip the sugar topping. Bake and cool the muffins, then top them with a simple cream cheese frosting: Beat together 8 ounces softened cream cheese, 4 tablespoons room-temperature unsalted butter and 1/2 cup sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar. Spread the frosting liberally on the muffins and top with chocolate sprinkles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/20/dining/sse-pumpkin-chocolate-swirl-muffins/merlin_215156502_352ec7cd-38d6-431a-acc4-de8abf286faa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, snack, dessert", "keywords": "dutch-processed cocoa powder, make-ahead, muffin, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, vegetable oil, yogurt, fall, halloween", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 656}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "3/4 cup/165 grams packed light or dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup vegetable oil", "1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin pur\u00e9e (about 1 3/4 cups); see Tip", "2 large eggs", "1/4 cup plain whole-milk yogurt", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/47 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder, sifted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
