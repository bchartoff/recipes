{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rosemary-Honey Almond Tart", "description": "In this stunning tart, a gently set custard studded with sliced almonds is baked in a buttery shortbread crust. It is as fit as a dinner-party dessert as it is daytime sweet to accompany cups of warm tea or coffee. The honey in the custard is steeped with rosemary, but other fresh herbs, such as marjoram, tarragon and thyme, can be substituted to add a nice savory hint to the floral syrup. You can do several steps ahead of time, or the whole tart can be prepared and baked, then cooled, wrapped and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/22/dining/YK-rosemary-honey-almond-tart/merlin_199406919_f38195ee-abfd-4d7f-b63f-74438418c6d0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "almond, honey, rosemary", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 522}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons/75 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, plus more for the pan", "1 1/2 cups/205 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough", "1/3 cup/63 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 large egg yolks", "1/4 cup/58 milliliters cold water", "1/2 cup/144 grams honey, such as wildflower", "6 tablespoons/75 grams unsalted butter, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "1/3 cup/63 grams granulated sugar", "4 small rosemary sprigs", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 large egg plus 2 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1 1/4 cups/156 grams sliced almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: Generously butter a 10-inch round (3/4- to 1-inch deep) fluted tart pan.
