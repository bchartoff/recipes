{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Porgy Fillets With Pickled Jalape\u00f1o-Herb Sauce", "description": "Dane Sayles, the chef of East Hampton Point in New York, believes porgies can take strong flavorings, so he adds spicy pickled peppers and their pickling liquid to his herb marinade. He also whizzes in some tahini, which smooths the emulsified mixture. At his restaurant, he blanches the herbs (drops them in boiling water for 10 seconds, then plunges them into ice water before draining) to help fix their color. It's something you can do as well and should remember the next time you make pesto.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/12/dining/12PORGYREX2-porgy-fillets-jalapeno-herb-sauce-2/merlin_192670554_17cf0c29-7c18-4ae8-b034-30046a5257e4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "grapeseed oil, herbs, pickled jalape\u00f1o peppers, porgies", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 8}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup packed mint leaves", "1/2 cup packed basil leaves", "1/2 cup packed flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1 tablespoon sliced pickled jalape\u00f1os plus 3 tablespoons pickling liquid", "1/2 tablespoon tahini", "1/2 cup grapeseed oil, plus more for cooking", "Salt and black pepper", "4 skin-on porgy fillets (about 8 ounces each; see Tip)", "2 lemons, 1 juiced, 1 cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the mint, basil, parsley, jalape\u00f1os with their pickling liquid and the tahini in a food processor.
