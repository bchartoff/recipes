{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fish With Sizzling Olive Butter", "description": "Sizzling butter is an excellent base for several classic sauces for fish, including amandine and meuni\u00e8re. Here, garlic, sliced olives (try a mix of green and black), fennel seeds and lime juice are thrown into the pan, adding tangy, bright and aromatic flavors. You can use this sauce for any kind of fish, whether pearly fillets of cod or meaty tuna or salmon. It even works with shrimp and chicken breasts. After all, there are few things that aren\u2019t improved by a drizzle of garlicky melted butter. Serve this over rice or with crusty bread to catch all that butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/dining/24appe1/merlin_167225676_7b095de0-51c7-4d27-b5fb-fb5208979918-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "cilantro, dill, olives, whitefish fillet, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 270}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup mixed olives, such as Kalamata, Castelvetrano, Moroccan or Picholine, pitted and sliced", "2 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated", "1/2 teaspoon fennel or coriander seeds, coarsely crushed (use the flat side of your knife or a mortar and pestle)", "4 (1-inch-thick) pieces flaky white fish fillet, such as cod (about 6 ounces each), patted dry", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 lime wedges, plus more for serving", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro or parsley, leaves and tender stems", "1/4 cup chopped dill, leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
