{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "No-Churn Olive Oil Ice Cream With Hot Fudge", "description": "At Ecco restaurant in Atlanta, one dessert stands above the rest: a salted olive oil gelato. Inspired by that dish in flavor but not in method, this frozen treat doesn\u2019t require an ice-cream maker. Instead, a sweetened condensed milk base, flavored with olive oil, is lightened with whipped cream and frozen. Once this fluffy mass is firm and scooped, the silky texture will make you think: Why does anyone churn at all? The hot fudge sauce, with its chewy texture and deep, chocolaty flavor, is as easy to make and uses up the other half of a 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/09/dining/04fortworex-no-churn-ice-cream-with-hot-fudge/merlin_201070965_3d1328a5-df55-4f91-8970-397136a49862-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H25M", "recipeYield": "1 quart ice cream and 3/4 cup sauce", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 394}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk (7 ounces)", "2 tablespoons fruity extra-virgin olive oil (see Tip)", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/2 cups heavy cream", "2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk (7 ounces)", "2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (1/2 cup)", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 tablespoon fruity extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the ice cream: In a medium bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, olive oil and salt until well combined."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a separate larger bowl (or in the bowl of a stand mixer), whisk the heavy cream by hand or with a hand or stand mixer until stiff peaks form.
