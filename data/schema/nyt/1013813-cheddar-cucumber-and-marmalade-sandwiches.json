(Branston pickle is a British pickled chutney, made with vegetables, that dates back to the early 20th century.) You can certainly make the grown-up version. But this sweet, salty, cool variety is close to perfect for lunch or a light dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/21/dining/cucumber-still/cucumber-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weekday", "keywords": "cheddar, cucumber, pumpernickel, main course, raw, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 223}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 184, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "80 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 slices pumpernickel bread", "2 tablespoons butter, softened", "2 tablespoons orange marmalade", "6 ounces thinly sliced Cheddar or Gruy\u00e8re or Swiss cheese", "1 cup thinly sliced cucumber"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Spread the bread slices with butter and then a very thin layer of marmalade.
