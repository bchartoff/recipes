{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coq au Vin Blanc", "description": "Just as Oregon borrows from Burgundy in vineyards planted with pinot noirs and chardonnays, that region also inspires dinner. The iconic boeuf bourguignon would not be the best choice with chardonnay, but this version of coq au vin, replacing Chambertin with chardonnay, couldn\u2019t be better. I went light with it, omitting the bacon lardons. And I gave a nod to Oregon\u2019s truffle crop by finishing the sauce with a gloss of black truffle butter. It\u2019s a modest investment that elevates the dish. A generous slab of unsalted butter (especially if it\u2019s high-fat European-style) could also bolster the sauce, though with less foxy intrigue.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/14/dining/14pair-span/14pair-span-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chardonnay, chicken, mushroom, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 193}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 760, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "1425 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon grape-seed oil", "1 3 1/2-pound chicken, in 10 pieces without backbone, dried", "Salt and ground white pepper", "8 ounces white pearl onions, blanched 3 minutes and peeled", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1/4 cup finely chopped celery", "4 cloves garlic, sliced", "9 ounces oyster mushrooms, trimmed, clumps separated", "3/4 cup chardonnay", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "2 tablespoons butter (unsalted or black truffle)", "1 tablespoon minced tarragon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil on medium-high in a 4-quart stovetop casserole or saut\u00e9 pan.
