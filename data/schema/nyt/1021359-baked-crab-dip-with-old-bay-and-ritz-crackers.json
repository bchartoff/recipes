{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Crab Dip With Old Bay and Ritz Crackers", "description": "This crab dip is inspired by a recipe called \u201critzy dip\u201d from the \u201cThree Rivers Cookbook,\u201d a Pittsburgh community cookbook published in 1973, in which canned crab is mixed with cream cheese, topped with Ritz crackers and baked. Fresh lump crab meat is the star in this updated version, with lemon juice, scallions and plenty of Old Bay seasoning to spice things up. This recipe doubles easily for larger groups, and the whole thing can be assembled and refrigerated up to a day in advance before being baked.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/11/dining/lh-crab-dip/merlin_175265616_7d44a6b5-eb1d-4496-b21a-e02ecc473e49-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, seafood, appetizer", "keywords": "crab, cream cheese, lemon, mayonnaise, old bay seasoning, parmesan, ritz crackers, scallion, fourth of july, labor day, new year\u2019s day, super bowl, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 949}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter, for greasing the baking dish", "8 ounces fresh lump or jumbo lump crab meat", "4 ounces cream cheese, softened", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan", "3 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 scallion, trimmed and minced, plus more for serving", "3/4 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning, plus more for serving", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup crushed Ritz crackers (from about 7 crackers), plus more whole crackers for serving", "Sliced English cucumbers and other crackers, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees and grease a shallow, 2-cup capacity baking dish or ovenproof skillet with butter."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium mixing bowl, combine the crab meat, cream cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan,\u00a0mayonnaise,\u00a0lemon zest and juice, scallion, Old Bay and salt; mix with a fork until thoroughly combined.
