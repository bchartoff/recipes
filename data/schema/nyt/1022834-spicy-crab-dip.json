{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Crab Dip", "description": "This style of crab dip, often referred to as Maryland crab dip because of its Chesapeake Bay origins, makes for a festive appetizer. Here, it\u2019s served hot out of the oven and is extra creamy thanks to the combination of cream cheese and a little mayonnaise. Though crabs are plentiful this time of year \u2014 and you can certainly make this with freshly steamed and picked meat if you\u2019d like \u2014 canned lump crabmeat makes this dish simple to assemble. Just be careful to leave the clumps of meat as intact as possible when mixing. A sprinkle of cayenne pepper and a generous douse of hot sauce add heat to this flavorful dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/17/dining/VL-Spicy-Crab-Dip/merlin_198975495_1a67fa40-0390-47c8-94fa-0b520c8723f9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings (3 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "cayenne pepper, crab meat, cream cheese, christmas, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 356}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened, for greasing", "8 ounces cream cheese, softened", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "1 shallot, minced", "2 tablespoons minced chives, plus more for garnish", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)", "1 1/4 teaspoons Cajun seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon mustard powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan", "8 ounces lump crabmeat, drained and picked through for shells", "Black pepper", "5 butter crackers, finely ground, plus more for serving", "Ground cayenne, for serving", "Hot sauce, for serving", "Sliced toasted baguette, for serving", "Celery sticks and carrots, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
