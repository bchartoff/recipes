{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hashweh (Spiced Rice and Meat With Yogurt)", "description": "Hashweh means stuffing in Arabic, hence the name of this dish that is used to fill chicken, lamb, pigeon and almost any other poultry or meat that can be stuffed. The combination of warm spices, fluffy rice and tender meat with the crispy, fried nuts is so delicious, it has become a meal in its own right. For a more elaborate presentation, you can top it with shredded chicken or lamb. Whichever way you serve it, you\u2019re in for a real treat, with a recipe so simple it can easily make its way into your weekly dinner rotation. Hashweh pairs perfectly with a salad of finely chopped cucumbers, tomatoes and onions dressed with lemon, olive oil, salt and some dried mint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Reem Kassis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/08/dining/rk-hashweh2/merlin_197539866_3741a684-6eb5-493b-a312-d2f69993b230-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, stuffing and dressing, main course, side dish", "keywords": "ground lamb, pine nuts, rice, yogurt, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 158}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "2 3/4 cups calrose, jasmine or basmati rice", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for nuts", "1 1/2 pounds ground or minced lamb or beef (see Tip)", "4 scant cups homemade or store-bought chicken stock", "Salt", "1/2 cup/3 ounces pine nuts", "1 cup/4 ounces slivered almonds", "2 Persian or other mini cucumbers", "Salt", "1 1/2 cups plain Greek yogurt", "1 garlic clove, crushed", "1/2 teaspoon lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the rice: Mix together allspice, cinnamon, black pepper and nutmeg and set aside.
