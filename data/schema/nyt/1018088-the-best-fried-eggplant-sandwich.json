{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Best Fried-Eggplant Sandwich", "description": "In the spring of 2016, my most favorite sandwich was fried eggplant, mozzarella and roast beef on an Italian hero, with hot peppers and a slash of mayonnaise. I adapted the recipe from a sandwich served at Defonte\u2019s Sandwich Shop, on Columbia Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn. It is a beautiful torpedo of food, crunchy, silken, sweet and spicy all at once. You can certainly omit the roast beef to make it vegetarian or at any rate a little smaller, the sort of meal that offers satisfaction without hurting anyone, that delivers deliciousness at a lower cost to the body that consumes it. It is still a colossal feed. It is still the best sandwich.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/01/magazine/01eat1/01eat1-articleLarge-v2.png", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches", "keywords": "cherry peppers, eggplant, mozzarella, roast beef", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 308}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1005, "unsaturatedFatContent": "60 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "84 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "1249 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 smallish Italian eggplants, roughly 1 1/2 pounds total", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "4 large eggs", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese", "4 hero rolls", "2 to 3 tablespoons mayonnaise", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into thin slices", "8 ounces sliced cooked roast beef (optional)", "1 cup hot cherry peppers, or to taste, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a large, rimmed sheet pan with paper towels.
