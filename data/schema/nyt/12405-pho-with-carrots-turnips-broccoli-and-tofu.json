Wait for the water to come back up to a rolling boil; it will bubble up, so don't fill the pot all the way; and add 1 cup of cold water. Allow the water to come back to a rolling boil and add another cup of cold water. Allow the water to come to a boil one more time and add a third cup of water. When the water comes to a boil again, the noodles should be cooked through. Drain and divide among 6 large soup bowls.\nFor rice noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the noodles. Cook until just al dente, firm to the bite, following the timing instructions on the package (my wide noodles take about 5 minutes). Drain and divide among 6 large soup bowls."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the turnips and carrots to the simmering broth and simmer until just tender, about 2 minutes.
