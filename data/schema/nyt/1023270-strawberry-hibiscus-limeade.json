{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Hibiscus Limeade", "description": "Red drinks are central to Juneteenth celebrations, as the color red represents the blood shed by enslaved people. Strawberry soda is commonly served, but this punch builds on that tradition, adding hibiscus, lime juice and mint to a strawberry base. It\u2019s a great way to use up slightly overripe strawberries. (It\u2019s better to use overripe berries than underripe ones, since underripe berries can have bitter notes.) The pineapple juice ice cubes are a little extra effort, but they melt right into the drink, changing its flavor as you drink it. At first, it\u2019s good. Over time, it\u2019s incredible.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/14/dining/mp-strawberry-hibiscus-lemonade/mp-strawberry-hibiscus-lemonade-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "fourth of july, hibiscus, lime juice, strawberries, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 153}, "recipeIngredient": ["Pineapple juice", "2 sprigs fresh mint, leaves picked and stems discarded", "2 hibiscus tea bags or 1/2 cup dried hibiscus flowers", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice", "1/2 pound fresh strawberries, hulled", "1/2 cup store-bought hibiscus syrup or homemade <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014441-simple-syrup\">simple syrup</a>", "Fresh strawberries, lime slices and fresh mint leaves, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The night before serving, make the pineapple ice cubes: Pour pineapple juice into an ice cube tray, and allow to freeze overnight."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To a large pot, add 6 cups of water and bring to a boil over high heat.
