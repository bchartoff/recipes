{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Coconut Greens With Tomatoes and Shrimp", "description": "This dish is loosely inspired by laing, a Filipino dish of dried taro leaves cooked in coconut milk that is traditionally made with pork and bagoong, a fermented fish or shrimp paste. This is quite a diversion, prepared with braised chard and topped with burst tomatoes and seared shrimp. You use only half the chard stems here, so you should reserve the extra stems to throw into soups, stews or your morning eggs. Get ahead by making these coconut greens up to two days in advance, then reheating to serve; the flavors will only improve over time. Serve with jasmine rice for a complete meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/11/dining/11EAT-spicy-coconut-greens/merlin_212146899_6266bc70-e6e8-43c5-bf05-7c0e385fc98a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "cherry tomato, coconut milk, make-ahead, shrimp, swiss chard", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 220}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons virgin coconut oil", "1 small yellow onion, finely chopped", "2 pounds Swiss chard, leaves roughly shredded (about 7 cups), half the stems reserved then cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "8 garlic cloves, finely grated", "1 (2 1/2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated (about 1 \u00bd teaspoons)", "3/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (omit if you prefer less heat)", "1 (13-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk, 2 tablespoons coconut milk reserved", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon lime juice plus 1 lime, cut into 4 wedges for serving", "1 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce", "3 tablespoons virgin coconut oil", "1/2 teaspoon hot smoked paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "3 red bird\u2019s-eye chiles, pierced a few times with a knife", "10 ounces datterini or cherry tomatoes", "1/2 pound medium shrimp, peeled, deveined and tails removed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start with the greens: Heat the coconut oil in a large saucepan over medium-high.
