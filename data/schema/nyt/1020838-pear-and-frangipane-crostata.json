A small wedge is sufficient after a big meal, but no one will complain if you serve a dab of whipped cream or ice cream on the side. This tart is best on the day it is baked: Save time by making the dough and lining the tart pan up to a week in advance and freezing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/05/dining/03Tanisrex-crostata/03Tanisrex-crostata-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "almond, egg, pear, rum, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 150}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "Pinch of salt", "1 whole egg, plus 2 yolks", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), softened", "2 1/4 cups/290 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/110 grams finely ground blanched almonds", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar, plus 2 tablespoons for sprinkling", "3 tablespoons/45 grams melted unsalted butter", "2 egg yolks, plus 1 whole egg", "2 tablespoons dark rum", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "2 or 3 medium pears, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Heat oven to 375 degrees.
