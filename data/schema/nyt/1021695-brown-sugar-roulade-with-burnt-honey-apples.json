{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Sugar Roulade With Burnt Honey Apples", "description": "If the flavors of winter could be rolled into one, then this meringue roulade would be the result: Warming cinnamon, burnt honey, sweet apples and tangy orange come together to make a dessert fit for the festive season. Make sure all your individual components have completely cooled before assembling, as you don\u2019t want to create any excess moisture in the roulade. Get ahead by making the apples and cream the day before, then keeping them refrigerated until needed. Feel free to make this roulade your own by swapping out pears for apples, cardamom for cinnamon or more whipping cream for mascarpone. So long as you stick to the basic technique, the flavors are yours to play with.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/11/dining/11Ottolenghirex1/11Ottolenghirex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "apple, bay leaves, egg, honey, mascarpone, orange, vanilla, christmas, new year\u2019s day, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 498}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/150 grams runny honey", "1 vanilla bean (vanilla pod), halved, seeds scraped out and bean reserved", "5 fresh bay leaves", "1 cinnamon stick", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt", "3 1/2 tablespoons orange juice", "2 1/2 pounds/1.1 kilograms Braeburn apples (about 7 to 8), peeled, cored and each cut into 8 wedges (or 10 if the apples are larger)", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "9 ounces/250 grams chilled egg whites (from 6 to 8 large eggs, or an egg white carton)", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams superfine sugar (caster sugar)", "1/2 cup/100 grams soft light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste", "2 teaspoons white wine vinegar", "2 teaspoons cornstarch (cornflour)", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/250 grams mascarpone, cold", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters cold whipping cream", "2 tablespoons/20 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar (icing sugar)", "1 tablespoon orange zest, plus 1 teaspoon to garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven 425 degrees Fahrenheit/220 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the apple filling: Add the honey, vanilla seeds and bean (pod), bay leaves, cinnamon stick, ground cinnamon and flaky salt to a large, oven-proof saut\u00e9 pan.
