{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Browned-Butter Rhubarb Crisp", "description": "Making a crisp is one of the best and easiest ways to highlight seasonal fruit. Crisps come together quickly with no special equipment, and they are a great way to use the odds and ends of fruit in your refrigerator. This recipe highlights one of spring\u2019s finest flavors: rhubarb. It is often paired with berries, but here, rhubarb shines on its own, with tart, puckery flavor and gorgeous color. Browned butter and almonds add toasty, nutty notes to the topping, making this an almost-effortless, high-impact dessert. You may notice that 2 tablespoons of the butter aren\u2019t browned; they are added to the hot browned butter to cool it down a bit so that you can use it immediately. Feel free to swap an equal amount of rolled old-fashioned oats for the almonds in the topping. Serve this cozy dessert with whipped cream or ice cream, if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/27/dining/ya-browned-butter-rhubarb-crisp/ya-browned-butter-rhubarb-crisp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "almond, brown butter, butter, rhubarb, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 147}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/141 grams unsalted butter", "1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/100 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 cup/55 grams sliced almonds", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or \u00bc teaspoon fine salt", "2 pounds rhubarb, chopped into 1-inch pieces (8 cups)", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/113 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons vanilla paste or extract", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest", "Pinch of kosher salt", "Vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream, to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
