{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup", "description": "This comforting soup tastes long-simmered, but it\u2019s cooked in a pressure cooker, which makes it a <span>weeknight </span>possibility (though you could also make <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021941\">this recipe in a slow cooker</a>). Use any variety of mushrooms you like: Cremini (also called baby bella) are affordable and easy to find and work well, or you can add shiitake or oyster mushrooms for a mix of texture and flavors. Don\u2019t worry about removing small, supple stems, but discard any that are tough or dried-out. Wild rice isn\u2019t a true rice at all but the seed of a grass that\u2019s native to North America. When it\u2019s cooked, it should be pleasantly chewy and nutty, not hard, and most of the grains should be slightly split open to reveal their creamy insides.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/sd-mushroom-soup/sd-mushroom-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "dry white wine, instant pot, mushroom, soup, sour cream, wild rice, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2255}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1 yellow or red onion, minced", "2 pounds mixed mushrooms (such as cremini and shiitake), tough stems removed, mushrooms chopped into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 celery stalks, chopped", "1 large carrot, peeled and chopped", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "5 cups vegetable or chicken stock", "1/2 cup dry white wine (see Tip)", "1 cup wild rice (about 6 ounces)", "1/2 cup sour cream", "Chopped scallions or chives and fresh dill, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn on the saut\u00e9 setting on a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker.
