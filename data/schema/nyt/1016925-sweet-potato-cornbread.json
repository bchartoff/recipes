The relationship, according to the food writer Sheri Castle, hinges on a history of abundance. \u201cSweet potatoes were plentiful, even among the poorest folks of any ethnicity,\u201d she said. \u201cEnslaved Africans used sweet potatoes in place of yams and other West African root vegetables.\u201d To this day, the state is a national leader in growing the crop. \n\nStephanie L. Tyson, the chef who oversees the kitchen at a Winston-Salem spot called (appropriately) Sweet Potatoes, likes to blend one Southern staple into another. The result is a cornbread laced with a holiday-friendly undercurrent of cinnamon and nutmeg. Ms.Tyson has said that the cornbread just clicks with a side of greens, but we have a feeling it will play well with cranberries and gravy, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19NORTHCAROLINA/19NORTHCAROLINA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "cornmeal, sweet potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 165}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 200, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "255 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons/30 milliliters vegetable oil, plus more for the muffin tin", "1 large sweet potato (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into large chunks", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters milk", "3/4 cup/94 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/4 cup/213 grams finely ground yellow cornmeal", "1 tablespoon/14 grams baking powder", "1 teaspoon/6 grams salt", "1/2 cup/100 grams sugar", "1/2 teaspoon/1 gram ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon/1 gram ground nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees and lightly brush a 12-cup muffin tin with oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place potato in a small saucepan and cover with cold water.
