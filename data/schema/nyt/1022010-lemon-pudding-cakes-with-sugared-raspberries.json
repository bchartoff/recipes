{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Pudding Cakes With Sugared Raspberries", "description": "Pudding cakes are magical sweets, baking up into two distinct layers from a single, straightforward batter. On top is an airy sponge cake that puffs in the oven\u2019s heat. Right beneath it is the pudding, a creamy lemon curd that\u2019s tangy and bracing thanks to a dash of buttermilk. Although these cakes are at their most tender when served within an hour of baking, they\u2019ll still be delicious at room temperature. Or chill them overnight and serve them straight from the fridge. The cake won\u2019t be as fluffy, but the lemon flavor will still shine bright. Feel free to use whatever ripe, juicy fruit you like here in place of the raspberries, or skip the fruit entirely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/19Apperex/merlin_184858530_26f0086f-06b4-4614-9e51-d85fe135e77a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "buttermilk, lemon, raspberry, easter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1336}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup/57 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted and cooled, plus more for greasing the ramekins", "3 large eggs, separated", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar, plus more as needed", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters buttermilk (or use plain yogurt thinned with milk)", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (from 1 to 2 lemons)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters lemon juice (from 3 to 4 lemons)", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt", "1/3 cup/43 grams all-purpose flour", "6 ounces/170 grams raspberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
