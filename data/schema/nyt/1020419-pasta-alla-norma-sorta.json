This updated version of the Sicilian classic includes\u00a0prosciutto, which is fried until golden. Its rendered fat is used to start the dish and provide a rich, nuanced flavor, and the cooked bits are used to finish it for a salty crunch. To save on time, the eggplant roasts while a\u00a0quick sauce of cherry and canned tomatoes,\u00a0shallots, garlic and chile\u00a0comes together on the stovetop. Just before serving, the eggplant, pasta and mozzarella (in place of the traditional ricotta salata) are tossed together until melty and delicious.
