{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Barbecue Pork and Beans", "description": "Pork and beans are cooked together in a slow cooker for mutually beneficial results (If you don't have a slow cooker, you can do it in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020878-one-pot-barbecue-pork-and-beans\">a pot in the oven</a>.)\u00a0As the pork shoulder and barbecue sauce braise in the oven, the sauce soaks up the pork juices while the pork tenderizes. Then, beans are added to soak up the deeply concentrated sauce. The recipe uses store-bought barbecue sauce enhanced with the smoky heat of canned chipotles in adobo and brown sugar, which helps glaze the pork. Because every barbecue sauce is different, taste and adjust yours as needed. (For a more acidic sauce, add apple cider vinegar with the beans, or you can increase the sweetness with added sugar.) To serve, slice the pork or shred it into pulled pork.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/14/dining/as-slow-cooker-pork-and-beans/as-slow-cooker-pork-and-beans-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, barbecues, beans, meat, one pot", "keywords": "barbecue sauce, chipotle, chipotles in adobo, garlic, pinto beans, pork shoulder, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 3 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, trimmed of more than 1/4-inch fat", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup store-bought or homemade barbecue sauce", "1 chipotle in adobo, finely chopped, plus more to taste", "3 tablespoons light brown sugar, plus more to taste", "2 (14-ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed", "6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the pork all over with 1 tablespoon salt and and 3/4 teaspoon pepper.
