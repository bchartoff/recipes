{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soy-Braised Tofu With Bok Choy", "description": "This Chinese-style braised tofu is an ideal midweek dinner over rice or noodles. Shallow frying the tofu first makes it sturdier and prevents it from breaking apart in the sauce. (You could also deep-fry or use an air fryer.) Cutting the tofu into thicker pieces means that each mouthful is crisp yet plump, with a soft interior. This is an adaptable dish; when adding the bell peppers, you could add more vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, snow peas or whatever you have on hand. Those familiar with restaurant-style braised tofu may expect more sauce, but in this homestyle version, the seasoning sauce delicately coats the tofu and vegetables without drowning them. That said, double the sauce if you prefer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/06/dining/06hm-braised-tofu/merlin_209335098_e58955d3-a2b4-41c4-8453-b79898c6cfd8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "air fryer, bell pepper, bok choy, soy sauce, tofu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 382}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and patted dry", "Neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable", "Salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon doubanjiang or chile oil", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)", "4 scallions, trimmed, white and green parts separated and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 bell pepper (any color), stem and membrane removed, cut into 1-inch pieces", "2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine (optional)", "4 baby bok choy, trimmed and halved through the stem", "Cooked rice or noodles, for serving", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon vegetarian stir-fry sauce or oyster sauce", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut tofu across into \u00be-inch-thick slices, then cut each slice in half so you have roughly 12 squares."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large (12-inch), deep-sided nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet on medium-high.
