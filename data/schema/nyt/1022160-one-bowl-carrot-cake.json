{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Bowl Carrot Cake", "description": "The tangy, rich cream cheese topping on this cake can travel \u2014 even on a hot day. Silky with sour cream, it bakes right over the batter and develops a caramelized flavor reminiscent of Basque cheesecake. As it cools, the deeply browned surface ripples, and the custardy cream cheese layer sets. The carrot cake beneath packs more carrots than most classic versions for a more complex natural sweetness and fine, sturdy crumb. Both batters are mixed by hand in the same bowl, making prep and clean up especially easy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/29/dining/gk-carrot-cake/gk-carrot-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "One 8-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, dessert", "keywords": "birthday, easter, carrot, carrot cake, cream cheese, one bowl, sour cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2840}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (8-ounce/226-gram) block cream cheese, softened", "1/2 packed cup/73 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large egg", "1/2 cup/120 grams sour cream", "Nonstick cooking spray", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup/168 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/100 grams neutral oil, such as vegetable oil", "1 cup/135 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021926-sweet-baking-spice\">sweet baking spice</a> or any combination of ground cinnamon, cardamom, ginger or nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 packed cups/260 grams coarsely grated peeled carrots (from 3 medium carrots)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
