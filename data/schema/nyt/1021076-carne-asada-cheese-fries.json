{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carne Asada Cheese Fries", "description": "The Piper Inn is one of the oldest, oddest and friendliest restaurants in Denver, loved by bikers and hipsters alike. It\u2019s been owned by the Levin family since opening in 1968, but because so many different cooks have passed through the kitchen over fifty years, it has a Chinese-American-Mexican menu that is entirely unique. Carne asada fries, French fries topped with the fillings of a carne asada (steak) taco, are a California-Mexican classic. The Piper Inn adds a Midwestern-style beer cheese sauce to its popular version.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/22/dining/jm-carne-asada-cheese-fries/jm-carne-asada-cheese-fries-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, snack, dips and spreads, finger foods, meat, vegetables, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "beer, cheddar, cream cheese, flank steak, lime juice, onion, potato, skirt steak, steak", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 375}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound skirt steak or flank steak, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice (from 1 lime)", "1 tablespoon chili powder", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne (optional)", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1 tablespoon neutral oil", "4 ounces cream cheese, cubed", "1/3 cup beer (preferably a lager or other beer without a pronounced flavor)", "2 cups finely shredded sharp Cheddar (about 8 ounces)", "1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/4 teaspoon smoked or sweet paprika", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1/2 cup finely chopped yellow or white onion", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving", "1 1/2 pounds homemade French fries or any fresh or frozen fried potato variety, such as home fries, waffle fries, curly fries or tater tots", "Crema Mexicana or sour cream (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add steak to a medium bowl, and toss with the lime juice, chili powder, cayenne (if using), salt and pepper until thoroughly coated.
