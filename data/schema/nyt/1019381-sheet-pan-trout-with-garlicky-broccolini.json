{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Trout With Garlicky Broccolini", "description": "The benefits of cooking trout in its whole, butterflied form go beyond visual appeal \u2014 the large piece drastically reduces the risk of overcooking, and the longer roasting time gives other vegetables on the pan, like wispy broccolini (or smashed boiled potatoes, or halved cherry tomatoes), a chance to crisp up. Once the pan is out of the oven, spoon over a punchy dressing made from raw garlic, smoky Aleppo pepper and fresh lemon juice, and let the residual heat mellow and meld the flavors before serving. Most grocery stores sell trout already butterflied (it\u2019s the most common ready-to-buy preparation), which saves you the extra step of trying to figure out how to do it yourself. If not, ask and they will happily oblige.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/11romanrex/11romanrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "broccolini, trout, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 622}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 476, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1186 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 garlic clove, finely grated", "2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper (or 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes)", "1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice, plus 1/2 lemon, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 whole butterflied trout, about 12 ounces each, heads removed if you like", "2 bunches broccolini, ends trimmed", "2 tablespoons capers, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
