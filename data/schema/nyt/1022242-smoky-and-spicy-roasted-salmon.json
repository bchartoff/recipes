{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky and Spicy Roasted Salmon", "description": "Inspired by the smoke, spice and sweetness that characterize classic dry barbecue rubs, this super easy salmon recipe skips the grill, making for easy cleanup and a dinner that\u2019s doable any night of the week. While a fragrant rub like this one might overpower a milder fish, salmon stands up to strong flavors beautifully. This dish works well with summer picnic sides like coleslaw and potato salad, but it is equally good with roasted potatoes and a simple green salad. The rub is only mildly spicy as written, so add a pinch of cayenne if you\u2019d like a little more kick.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/17/dining/lh-smoky-sweet-salmon/merlin_187777572_13205874-6b4e-4711-86d5-e0a95ce83587-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "brown sugar, chili powder, dry mustard, salmon, smoked paprika", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 485}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6-ounce) skinless salmon fillets", "1 1/2 tablespoons dark or light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for serving", "1 teaspoon dry mustard powder", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1/2 teaspoon chili powder", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
