{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Butter", "description": "In this unusual recipe, seasoned, rendered chicken fat and creamy butter are whipped with a little maple syrup for an earthy, rich and lightly sweet spread for bread. Make sure to cook the chicken skin until it turns nut brown \u2014 that\u2019s what gives the fat its fried chicken flavor. While you could use schmaltz in place of rendering the fat yourself, the flavor won\u2019t be quite the same because schmaltz usually includes onions in the rendering. If you haven\u2019t been saving your chicken skin and trimmings in your freezer to render, you can usually order the skin from a butcher if you give them enough advance notice. And make sure to save the fried chicken skin as a cook\u2019s snack. It\u2019s the crunchy, salty byproduct of this excellent spread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/07/dining/recipe-chicken-butter/recipe-chicken-butter-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2/3 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, condiments, dips and spreads", "keywords": "butter, chicken fat, chicken skin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 233, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "16 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound raw chicken skin and fat", "1 bay leaf", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick) at room temperature", "1 tablespoon maple syrup", "1/2 teaspoon salt, more for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat, add chicken skin and fat and bay leaf and cook until skin is crispy and brown, about 8 minutes.
