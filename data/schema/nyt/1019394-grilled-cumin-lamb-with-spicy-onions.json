{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Cumin Lamb With Spicy Onions", "description": "Yogurt makes a great base for a marinade, adding a milky tang and helping to tenderize all kinds of meats. In this case, the yogurt is spiked with aromatics\u00a0\u2014\u00a0toasted cumin, green chile, herbs, and plenty of ginger and garlic \u2014 which impart complex flavors to a butterflied leg of lamb destined for the grill. Lightly pickled, spicy onions make a bright garnish here, but you can skip them if it seems like one step too many. Instead, just slice up a red onion and scatter the raw slivers over the top of the meat for a contrasting crunch. If you\u2019d rather cook this inside, you can broil it instead of grilling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/11apperex/merlin_140640339_3e471f34-de1c-48ca-8b1f-55b734c92973-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat", "keywords": "cilantro, leg of lamb, mint, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 191}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 363, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "586 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 limes", "2 medium red onions, peeled", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "Pinch of granulated sugar", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, plus more as needed for sprinkling", "1 1/2 tablespoons cumin seeds", "2 teaspoons coriander seeds", "1/3 cup plain yogurt, plus more for serving, if desired", "1/3 cup fresh mint leaves and tender stems, plus more for serving", "1/3 cup fresh cilantro, leaves and tender stems, plus more for serving", "6 garlic cloves", "1 small jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded if desired", "1 inch piece of ginger, peeled and sliced into thin coins", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 boneless butterflied leg of lamb, about 5 to 6 pounds without the bone", "Flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate the zest from one of the limes and squeeze the juice.
