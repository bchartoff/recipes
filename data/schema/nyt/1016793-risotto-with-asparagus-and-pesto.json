This time, I also stirred in some pesto, which enriches the risotto deliciously, and also dresses it up with flecks of green.

Add another ladleful or two of the stock and continue to cook in this fashion, adding more stock and stirring when rice is almost dry. You do not have to stir continually, but stir often.
