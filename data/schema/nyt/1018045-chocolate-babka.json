{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Babka", "description": "Baking a chocolate babka is no casual undertaking. The Eastern European yeast-risen coffee cake has 14 steps and takes all day to make. But the results are worth every sugarcoated second \u2013 with a moist, deeply flavored brioche-like cake wrapped around a dark fudge filling, then topped with cocoa streusel crumbs.\n\nIf you want to save yourself a little work and love Nutella, you can substitute 1 1/2 cup (420 grams) of it for the homemade fudge filling. Also note that you can make this over a few days instead of all at once. Babka freezes well for up to 3 months, so if you\u00a0 need only one loaf now, freeze the other for later.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/31/multimedia/clark-babka/clark-babka-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT3H30M", "recipeYield": "2 loaves", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european, jewish", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, project", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, heavy cream, semisweet chocolate chips, yeast, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 906}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/118 milliliters whole milk", "1 package (1/4 ounce/7 grams) active dry yeast", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar, plus a pinch", "4 1/4 cups/531 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "4 large eggs, at room temperature, lightly beaten", "10 tablespoons/140 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing bowls and pans", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 cup/177 milliliters heavy cream or half-and-half", "Pinch kosher salt", "6 ounces/170 grams extra bittersweet chocolate, preferably between 66 and 74 percent cocoa, coarsely chopped", "8 tablespoons/112 grams/1 stick unsalted butter, diced, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/60 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons/45 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons/11 grams cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 1/2 tablespoons/64 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/3 cup/60 grams mini semisweet chocolate chips", "2/3 cup/135 grams granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a small saucepan or a bowl in the microwave, warm the milk until it\u2019s lukewarm but not hot (about 110 degrees).
