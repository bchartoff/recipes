Maaf\u00e9 is often called West African peanut stew, but that\u2019s an oversimplification. Across the region, there are many versions that feature peanuts as a base, and all are greatly nuanced: For example, there\u2019s akitiwa in Togo, nkatenkwan in Ghana and miyan taushe across northern Nigeria. This highly adaptable stew can be made with any assortment of meat, poultry, seafood and seasonal vegetables you have on hand (see Tip), but this one goes all in on produce. Keeping the Scotch bonnet whole in the sauce controls the heat: cook to soften, then break it open to dissolve seeds in the sauce for more heat, or cook and remove the softened whole chile from the sauce for less heat. Serve it all over steamed rice, millet or fonio, with some lime slices for squeezing. Maaf\u00e9 can be made ahead, refrigerated and reheated for a warm, comforting meal whenever you need \u2014 its rich flavor only improves with time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/02/dining/26komolaferex-maafe/merlin_215042799_bc2aa535-f2b8-4897-aa66-e8e48813a953-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "main course", "keywords": "butternut squash, carrot, make-ahead, peanut butter, sturdy greens, west african, fall, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 803}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1 small red onion, chopped", "4 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, scrubbed and grated", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 (14 1/2-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes", "1 red Scotch bonnet", "Salt", "2 medium green plantains, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (see Tip)", "4 cups vegetable stock or water", "2 medium carrots, scrubbed and cut into 1-inch pieces (see Tip)", "1/2 medium butternut squash (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (see Tip)", "1/2 cup creamy, unsalted peanut butter", "2 tablespoon tamarind pur\u00e9e (optional)", "2 teaspoons ground dawadawa (see Tip) or 1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)", "4 cups hearty greens, such as mature spinach, turnip greens, collards or kale, chopped with stems", "Steamed rice, fonio or millet, for serving", "1 lime, sliced, for squeezing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium, and add the onion and garlic.
