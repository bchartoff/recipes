{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry Cream Popsicles", "description": "These naturally purple pops are made with a combination of simmered blueberries pur\u00e9ed into an easy no-churn ice cream base. You can substitute yogurt or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche for the sour cream; either will give the popsicles a subtle tang. You can use fresh or frozen berries. (Frozen berries can be thawed and used as directed in the method below. Or use them straight from the freezer, but add 2 to 4 minutes to the cook time.) The number of pops this recipe makes depends on the size and shape of the molds used. The base can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours if you need to freeze in batches; just give the mixture a stir before using.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/16/dining/ejm-blueberry-cream-popsicles/ejm-blueberry-cream-popsicles-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 10 popsicles", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets, dessert", "keywords": "blueberries, condensed milk, heavy cream, lemon juice, sour cream, sugar, vanilla, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 549}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/290 grams fresh or frozen blueberries", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters sweetened condensed milk", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters sour cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, toss the blueberries, lemon juice, sugar and salt to combine.
