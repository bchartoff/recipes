Most home bars contain a decent selection of base spirits and very few modifiers. A bucket of ice, a few limes and a minibar may look like a world of opportunities, but it\u2019s not.\n\nSo instead of planning a party around what you have around the house, buy a modifier like orange Cura\u00e7ao, B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine, maraschino or Campari. You can make several different classic cocktails by pairing one of those with bitters, vermouth or a few items from the fruit stand. You\u2019ll also build up your back bar, one bottle at a time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jim Meehan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/16/dining/Enchantress2/Enchantress2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "for one", "keywords": "cognac, port, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 35}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 202, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "7 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces port", "1 ounce cognac", "\u00bd ounce orange Cura\u00e7ao", "\u00bd ounce lemon juice", "Orange twist, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Shake all liquid ingredients with ice.
