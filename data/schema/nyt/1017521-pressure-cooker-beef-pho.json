{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Beef Pho", "description": "An elegant, comforting bowl of pho usually requires blanching beef bones and then simmering them with spices for hours. Andrea Nguyen, a cookbook author who lives in drought-plagued California, wanted the same effect but in a recipe that used less water and less energy. This broth can be put together in less than an hour. It cooks in a standard stove-top pressure cooker for 20 minutes and in an electric pressure cooker for 30. \u201cAs much as I love to simmer a stockpot of beef pho for three hours,\u201d Ms. Nguyen says, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly liberating to make a pretty good version for four people in about an hour.\"", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/dining/08JPDRO2/08JPDRO2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef knuckle, beef steak, rice stick noodles, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 677}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 453, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "73 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "245 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds beef knuckle, marrow or other soup bones", "1 pound boneless beef brisket, chuck or cross-rib roast in one piece", "4 ounces Fuji apple, about 1/2 of a medium-large apple", "1 large yellow onion", "2 ounces fresh ginger", "2 1/2 pieces star anise", "1 3-inch cinnamon or cassia stick", "3 whole cloves", "2 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons fish sauce", "Sugar, if desired", "6 ounces beef steak, such as top or bottom sirloin, eye of round or London broil (optional)", "12 ounces dried narrow rice sticks or pad Thai-style noodles", "1/2 small yellow or red onion", "2 slender green onions", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves", "Black pepper", "Optional add-ins: thinly sliced Fresno, Thai or serrano chile; a large handful of bean sprouts, mint sprigs or Thai basil; lime wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the broth:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the bones and boneless beef.
