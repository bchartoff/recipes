{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Meatballs", "description": "Chicken meatballs may not be a traditionally Moroccan dish, but they work beautifully when spiced with paprika, cumin, cinnamon, ginger and garlic, which are commonly found in the country\u2019s cuisine. Whole-milk yogurt does double duty here: It\u2019s used to make the meatballs moist and tender, and makes for a speedy sauce to serve with them. Don\u2019t use ground chicken made with ultralean breasts; look for labels that show a mix of white and dark meat. (Or if you\u2019re feeling ambitious, grind your own boneless, skinless chicken thighs in the food processor.) Serve the meatballs with couscous and a green vegetable for a flavorful weeknight dinner that\u2019s well worth the effort.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/01/dining/lh-moroccan-chicken-meatballs/merlin_195006738_f4dc78be-a3d4-43ef-a902-69069e4bc75f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, cinnamon, cumin, ginger, panko, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1212}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups plain whole-milk yogurt", "1 tablespoon, plus 1 teaspoon minced or grated garlic (about 4 cloves)\u00a0", "2 teaspoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound ground chicken (not 100 percent breast meat)\u00a0", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for frying\u00a0", "1 teaspoon light brown or granulated sugar\u00a0", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "3 tablespoons toasted pine nuts (optional)\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "First, make the yogurt sauce: Combine 1 cup of the yogurt, 1 teaspoon of the garlic, the lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste in a small bowl.
