The chief indicator of a plantain\u2019s ripeness is its color and texture; the darker and softer the fruit, the sweeter its meat. For this recipe, which is not unlike <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020517-maduros-fried-sweet-plantains\">maduros</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020283-dodo-fried-plantains\">dodo</a>, opt for fruit that are as black and as soft to the touch as possible. This will likely require some in-home ripening, as most store-bought plantains are sold firm and unripened, in shades that run the gamut from dark green to pale yellow. To ripen them at home, store plantains in a loosely closed paper bag in a warm, dry place. The inclusion of fresh lime juice to the finished dish adds a bracing zing of citrus, which pairs wonderfully if you enjoy the plantains with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023733-brown-stew-pork-shoulder\">Brown Stew Pork Shoulder</a>, as the chef does.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brigid Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/21/multimedia/19kwanzaa-rex2-1-742f/19kwanzaa-rex2-1-742f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, quick, snack, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "canola oil, lime, plantain, kwanzaa, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 27}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 very ripe plantains (the skin should be black)", "1/2 cup neutral oil (such as canola or vegetable oil), for frying\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more as needed\u00a0", "1 lime, juiced\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a paring knife, slice off the ends of the plantains, removing about 1/2 inch from each tip.
