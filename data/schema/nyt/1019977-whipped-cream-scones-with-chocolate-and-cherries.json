{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whipped Cream Scones With Chocolate and Cherries", "description": "Chocolate and cherry is a classic combination, but how these scones come together is what makes them really special: Lightly whipping the cream before folding it into the dough creates tiny air bubbles that result in a scone that leans more toward cake than bread. They also develop a delicate, crackly crust and a melt-in-your-mouth creaminess. On top of the chocolate chunks, tart cherries and the fluffiness, here\u2019s another reason to love these scones: The dough is made by hand and doesn\u2019t require rolling or cutting, meaning less mess in the kitchen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/dining/gk-cherry-chocolate-scones/merlin_149765124_40de9a12-ebba-4e3c-a017-3df92e302aee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "12 scones", "recipeCuisine": "american, british", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, pastries, quick breads", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, butter, dried cherries, whipping cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 168}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 251, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "158 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters heavy whipping cream, chilled", "1/2 cup/115 grams salted butter (1 stick), cut into 1/2-inch cubes and chilled", "3 ounces/85 grams bittersweet chocolate, chopped", "1/2 cup/75 grams dried tart cherries", "Sparkling sugar, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
