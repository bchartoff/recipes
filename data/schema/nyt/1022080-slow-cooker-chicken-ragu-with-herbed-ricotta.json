{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Chicken Rag\u00f9 With Herbed Ricotta", "description": "This recipe has a comforting lasagna vibe, as the spicy chicken-and-tomato sauce mingles with the rich, herby ricotta. Make the sauce as hot as you like: Begin with 1 1/2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes for a fairly mild spice level, then add more at the end if you want more heat. You\u2019ll notice there isn\u2019t much liquid when the chicken and vegetables go into the slow cooker, but have faith: The juices released during cooking end up making a not-too-thick rag\u00f9 that is perfect for saucing pasta. In fact, because some chicken has more moisture than others, you may end up with more liquid than you\u2019d like. If that happens, turn off the heat so the sauce cools a bit and is not bubbling, then vigorously stir in two egg yolks before you add the pasta. This adds glossy thickening power, just like it does in carbonara.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/05/dining/sg-chicken-ragu/sg-chicken-ragu-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, chicken thigh, fettuccine, ricotta, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3178}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1 small carrot, peeled and chopped", "1/2 yellow or red onion, finely minced (about 1 cup)", "4 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 sprig fresh thyme (or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)", "1 sprig fresh oregano (or 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano)", "1 1/2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 (14-ounce) can whole tomatoes or crushed tomatoes", "8 ounces pappardelle, tagliatelle, fettuccine or other long, thick pasta", "1 cup whole-milk or part-skim ricotta", "Heaping 1/4 cup chopped soft fresh herbs, such as chives, oregano, parsley or basil, or a mix", "Juice of 1/4 lemon (1 to 2 teaspoons)", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "1 handful torn fresh basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the chicken, carrot, onion, garlic, tomato paste, olive oil, thyme, oregano, red-pepper flakes and onion powder.
