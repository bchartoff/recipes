{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Papadzules (Eggs and Asparagus in Tortillas With Pepita Sauce)", "description": "A dish from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in southeastern Mexico, papadzules are similar to enchiladas in that they feature tortillas that are dipped and coated in a sauce, then filled, rolled and topped with more sauce. Traditionally, papadzules are served with hard-boiled eggs and topped with a toasted pepita sauce and a spicy habanero-tomato salsa. In this late-spring version, jammy eggs and blanched asparagus serve as the filling, and an uncooked sauce of pepitas and jalape\u00f1os finishes everything off. Be sure to cook the eggs for the full 6\u00bd minutes or the yolks will be too runny.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
