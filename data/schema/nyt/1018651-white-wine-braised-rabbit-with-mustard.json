{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Wine-Braised Rabbit With Mustard", "description": "This is a version of lapin \u00e0 la moutarde, a homey, traditional French dish still popular in old-fashioned Parisian bistros at lunchtime. Yes, there are quite a few steps required to put this dish on the table, but probably no more than 30 minutes of active work. It is essentially a one-pot meal, with a little fiddling. The pleasingly sharp, succulent, saucy result is worth the extra effort. Get your rabbit in a butcher shop if possible, and ask to have it cut up; if your only option is a whole rabbit, it\u2019s not much more difficult than cutting up a chicken. Serve with\u00a0noodles if you'd like, or rice, mashed potatoes or steamed new potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/15/dining/15Kitchen1/15KITCH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "main course, mustard, noodles, rabbit, white wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 146}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 882, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "78 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1707 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small rabbit, about 3 pounds, cut into 6 to 8 pieces", "Salt and pepper", "3 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil", "1 cup all-purpose flour for dredging rabbit, plus 2 tablespoons for sauce", "1 large onion, diced (about 2 cups)", "1 cup dry white wine", "2 1/2 cups chicken broth", "1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard", "2 thyme branches", "12 sage leaves", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon chopped capers", "1/4 cup thinly sliced chives", "1 pound cooked pappardelle pasta or wide egg noodles, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay rabbit pieces on a baking sheet and season each piece generously with salt and pepper.
