{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jicama Salad With Lime Vinaigrette and Mint Cream", "description": "The chef Eric Werner, who moved from Brooklyn to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, in Mexico, in 2009, and opened Hartwood in Tulum, puts in long hours on the road every week chasing down local produce at remote markets and farms. He might not know what he'll do with it once back in the kitchen, he has the knack for turning a jumble of tropical fruits and vegetables into an American-style composed salad or a rustic but elegant side dish. Jicama is native to Central America, and readily available in the United States, but most home cooks haven't embraced it yet. This salad should change that. It's sliced into refreshing, crunchy slices, then lavished with flavors like mint and lime that are cool, tart and sweet. If you're not putting the salad together immediately, keep the sliced jicama in the refrigerator, covered with cold water and a squeeze of lemon juice. It will last for at least a day. Pat dry before using.
