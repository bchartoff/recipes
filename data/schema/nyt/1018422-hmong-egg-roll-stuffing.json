{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hmong Egg Roll Stuffing", "description": "One Thanksgiving, the pastry chef Diane Yang\u2019s parents, Hmong refugees from Laos, found that they had filling left over from making egg rolls, and her mother came up with the idea of using it to stuff the turkey. It's lighter than traditional bread stuffing, and yields relatively small servings, but it's a delicious addition to the feast. It is not intended to be baked alongside the turkey. If you'd like, double this recipe and use the remainder to fill egg rolls. Purchase egg roll wrappers (often found in the freezer section at the market), thaw them, and roll them with stuffing. Deep fry in vegetable oil until golden brown, and serve hot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/12/dining/COOKING-STUFFING1/COOKING-LAOTIAN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings, to stuff a 16-pound turkey", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cabbage, carrot, cilantro, oyster sauce, vermicelli, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 21}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 111, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "206 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 1/4 ounces/150 grams vermicelli bean thread noodles (preferably Lungkow brand)", "1 1/2 cups shredded green cabbage", "1 1/2 cups shredded carrots", "3/4 cup chopped green onion", "3/4 cup chopped cilantro", "3 eggs, beaten", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "2 tablespoons oyster sauce", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, soak bean thread noodles in hot water for 8 minutes.
