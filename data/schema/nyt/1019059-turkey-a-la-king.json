{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey \u00e0 la King", "description": "This is nursery food absolutely, soft and creamy, salty-sweet. It sits happily atop toast or biscuits, rice or waffles or noodles; in some households, it is wrapped within crepes: leftover turkey in gravy, essentially, with mushrooms and peas for heft. And as such it is comforting to eat, in much the same way that burrowing into a nest on the couch to watch football or a three-hankie movie is comforting. But it is also threadbare elegant with its whisper of sherry, vaguely French. You could of course make it with chicken instead of turkey, add diced ham or minced clams, shucked oysters or a handful of slivered pimiento. It's a very forgiving recipe. Make of it what you will.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/26/magazine/26mag-eat2/26mag-eat2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, poultry", "keywords": "fall, mushroom, peas, sherry, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 223}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 438, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "673 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 3/4 cups turkey or chicken stock, low-sodium if store-bought", "2 cups sliced mushrooms, ideally wild, approximately 4-6 ounces", "1 1/2 cups chopped cooked turkey", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1 cup frozen peas", "2 tablespoons dry sherry", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "Finely chopped parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make a roux.
