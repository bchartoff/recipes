And it can all be done in one pot instead of the usual two to three it would take on the stove. Here, the meatballs, which are not fried but cooked entirely in the sauce, are gently spiced and very tender \u2014 the height of kid-friendly cuisine. The ricotta topping is optional, but it makes the whole thing especially creamy and rich. If you have some homemade marinara sauce in the freezer, or a favorite store-bought kind, you can substitute 3 1/4 cups of it here. Olive fans take note: Adding 1/4 cup sliced pitted olives to the sauce will probably make you very happy come dinnertime.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/02/dining/02appetite2/merlin_148492107_c986aef4-a994-448b-a69e-63ca7e37e819-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "basil, crushed canned tomatoes, ground beef, spaghetti, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 446}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 743, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "961 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, very thinly sliced", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 basil sprigs, plus more thinly sliced for serving", "8 ounces spaghetti (not thin spaghetti), broken in half", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "1 cup ricotta (optional)", "1 pound ground beef (or substitute veal, pork or turkey)", "1/4 cup panko bread crumbs", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan", "2 tablespoons chopped basil", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 to 2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set pressure cooker to the saut\u00e9 function, and heat 2 tablespoons oil in the pot.
