{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tofu and Green Beans With Chile Crisp", "description": "I love to cook with chile crisp, a fiery hot-pepper condiment born in the Sichuan Province of China that generally relies on fried shallots and garlic for texture, and on any number of umami-rich special ingredients for distinction and oomph. It\u2019s magical: a boon to noodle soups and kitchen-sink stir-fries, to eggs and cucumbers, to plain steamed fish. Here, I use it as the base of a marinade and topping for baked tofu and green beans, with black vinegar, a little sesame oil, a wisp of honey, minced garlic and ginger, along with scallions and cilantro. But you could use the mixture on a mitten and have a very nice meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/28/multimedia/28sheetpan-tofu-greenbeans/28sheetpan-tofu-greenbeans-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, one pot, roasts, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "chili oil, chili paste, green beans, rice, sesame oil, soy sauce, tofu, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3012}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons chile-crisp condiment, plus more for serving", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 1/2 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil", "1 teaspoon honey", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "2 tablespoons chopped scallions", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro", "1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and sliced crosswise into 8 (1/2-inch-thick) slabs", "3/4 pound green beans", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed", "White rice, for serving", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
