This one emphasizes the pasta. The hearty lentil topping is a bit like a Bolognese rag\u00f9, and the addition of fennel \u2014 seeds, bulb and chopped green fronds \u2014 gives it surprising brightness and zest. For even more flavor, add some of your stored-away Parmesan rinds to the sauce. (Carnivores can add a little chopped anchovy or Italian fennel sausage.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/30/dining/30tanisrex2-pasta/merlin_179039565_ecae37ae-1cf7-479e-9505-529cf5951120-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "beans, pastas, main course", "keywords": "fennel, lentils, parmesan, passata, spaghetti, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 248}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup small lentils, such as Castelluccio or Puy", "A small piece of Parmesan rind (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 small onion, diced (about 1 cup)", "2 small fennel bulbs, diced (about 2 cups), lacy green fronds finely chopped and reserved", "1/2 teaspoon crushed fennel seeds", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 cup tomato passata or crushed canned tomato", "1 pound spaghetti", "Shavings of ricotta salata or pecorino cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse lentils.
