{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi Tuna Salad", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/dining/quick-kimchi-recipes.html\">Kimchi</a> and canned tuna make a popular combination in Korean cooking. These two pantry staples are found together in a number of dishes like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022130-kimchi-jjigae-with-ribs\">kimchi jjigae</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021373-kimbap\">kimbap</a>, and here they are the basis of a lively, fortifying salad. Combine them with fresh ginger and celery for crunch (or an equal amount of other crunchy vegetables, like thinly sliced sugar snap or snow peas, radishes, carrot, cabbage or fennel). The dressing is made using the spicy liquid from the kimchi jar, rice wine vinegar and sesame oil, but because each jar of kimchi is different, you may want to tweak the seasonings to taste. Eat the salad on its own; with gim, or seaweed, as a hand roll; or with something starchy to balance the punch, like a burger bun, rice, boiled potatoes, soba or ramen noodles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/03/dining/as-kimchi-tuna-salad/as-kimchi-tuna-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weekday, main course", "keywords": "celery, ginger, kimchi, tuna, tuna salad, dairy-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 983}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (16-ounce) jar cabbage kimchi, including juice", "2 tablespoons unseasoned rice wine vinegar, plus more to taste (or lemon or lime juice or 1 tablespoon fish sauce)", "3 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more to taste", "10 to 12 ounces canned tuna (preferably oil-packed), drained", "6 celery stalks, thinly sliced crosswise (about 2 cups)", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced into less than 1/4-inch-thick matchsticks", "Mayonnaise (optional)", "Red-pepper flakes, gochugaru or sambal oelek (optional)", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds or furikake (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a colander in a medium bowl and drain the kimchi.
