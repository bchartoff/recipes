{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "South Texas Barbecued Duck", "description": "This is a remarkably straightforward way of cooking a duck and results in powerfully smoky and salty-sweet meat. The recipe came to The Times in 2015 via the San Antonio chef Quealy Watson, who cooked it in a smoker filled with small logs of mesquite. You could make do with a grill if you kept one side of it entirely free of coals and placed the duck away from the flames. Straight kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper can be used in place of the Lawry\u2019s.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/30/magazine/SouthTexasBarbecuedDuck/SouthTexasBarbecuedDuck-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6-8", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "duck", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 55}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 835, "unsaturatedFatContent": "49 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "81 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "sodiumContent": "667 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "2 tablespoons ground cumin", "1 tablespoon ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons Lawry\u2019s seasoned salt", "1 4-to-6-pound duck"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Light a charcoal grill or smoker, or heat oven to 250."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make a dry rub by combining the cinnamon, coriander, cumin, black pepper and seasoned salt in a small bowl.
