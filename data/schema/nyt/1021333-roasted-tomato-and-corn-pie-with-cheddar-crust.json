{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Tomato and Corn Pie With Cheddar Crust", "description": "In this large-scale galette, cherry tomatoes, fresh corn and scallions are wrapped in a flaky Cheddar crust. The extra step of roasting the tomatoes first yields a pie that\u2019s on the just-right side of juicy. Make sure you bake it long enough, and don\u2019t be afraid to let the crust get deeply golden brown and allow the base to cook through. A good way to test for doneness is to gently shake the baking sheet: A crust that\u2019s not fully baked will stay in place on the baking sheet, whereas a well-baked crust will easily slide from one end to the other. Feel free to substitute another kind of grated cheese for the Cheddar; Gruy\u00e8re, Monterey jack and Parmesan are all delicious options.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/04/dining/ejm-corn-and-tomato-pie/ejm-corn-and-tomato-pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "1 (15-inch) pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pies and tarts, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "butter, cheddar, corn, flour, scallion, tomato, fall, summer, father\u2019s day, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, mother\u2019s day, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 565}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/225 grams cold unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "8 ounces/225 grams shredded Cheddar (about 2 cups)", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters ice water, plus more as needed", "7 cups/1 kilogram cherry or grape tomatoes", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste", "3 cups/435 grams fresh (3 to 5 ears), frozen or canned corn kernels", "1 bunch/120 grams scallions, trimmed and sliced into 1/4-inch pieces", "1 large egg", "Fresh basil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the Cheddar crust: In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the flour and salt until well combined.
