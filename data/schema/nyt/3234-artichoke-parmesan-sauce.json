Place a piece of butter in the eggs and continue stirring until eggs are warm and butter has melted. Then add another piece of butter and continue in the same manner until all the butter is used. If eggs start to curdle, immediately plunge the top boiler in bowl of icy water, still whisking. (This is an emergency procedure to lower the temperature rapidly.) Return the top boiler to the simmering water and continue adding butter."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When all the butter has been added, sauce should be quite thick.
