{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Chickpea Salad With Tahini and Pita Chips", "description": "This main-course salad has all the fresh flavors of a great falafel sandwich \u2014 tahini, mint, paprika, cucumber, cumin, garlic \u2014 plus the crunch of pita and the satisfying heft of chickpeas. The vegetarian cookbook writer Hetty McKinnon created this recipe, and the amount of olive oil she calls for might seem excessive. Don\u2019t hold back: After cooking the chickpeas, the oil becomes part of the garlicky, paprika-warmed dressing for the finished dish. You could make her recipe even easier by using salad greens instead of cooked greens as the base.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/dining/30faqrex1/merlin_153889782_0ac0b415-2667-4236-bb80-3d3b141e43f2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 main-course servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "chickpea, greens, mint leaves, pita, tahini, dairy-free, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, vegan, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 487}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, well drained, or 4 cups cooked chickpeas", "3/4 to 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 teaspoons ground cumin, or 1 teaspoon each ground cumin and ground coriander", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "Salt and pepper", "1/3 cup tahini", "Freshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon, plus more to taste", "1 garlic clove, minced", "Warm water, as needed", "Olive oil, for cooking", "About 10 ounces kale, chard or spinach, well washed and thick stems removed", "3 cups store-bought or homemade pita chips (see Tip)", "Handful of roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley", "Handful of roughly chopped mint", "1 large or 2 small cucumbers, peeled and thinly sliced", "Lemon, cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chickpeas: Heat oven to 425 degrees.
