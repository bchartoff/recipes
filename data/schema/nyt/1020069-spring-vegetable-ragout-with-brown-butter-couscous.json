{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Vegetable Rago\u00fbt With Brown Butter Couscous", "description": "The amazingly flavorful couscous here is the result of a trick from the chef Mourad Lahlou, whose San Francisco restaurants, Aziza (currently closed) and Mourad, feature a modernist approach to Moroccan cuisine. Freshly steamed couscous is tossed with sizzling brown butter, lots of chopped preserved lemon and a splash of saffron. It is seriously good with just about anything, especially seasonal vegetable rago\u00fbts. (Saucy braises of lamb, chicken or fish also pair well with it.) The recipe below uses spring vegetables, but you can substitute others throughout the year.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/27/dining/22kitchrex/22kitchrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, vegetables", "keywords": "asparagus, couscous, fava beans, peas, zucchini, main course, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 276}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 556, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "948 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 cups fine quick-cooking couscous", "6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces (3/4 stick)", "1 small preserved lemon, rinsed, peel and pulp chopped fine, seeds discarded", "1 large pinch of saffron, crumbled into 1/2 cup warm water\u00a0and left to steep at least 5 minutes", "2 cups roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus a few sprigs for garnish\u00a0(from about 2 bunches)", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 large Serrano chile, cut into 1/4-inch chunks", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons lime or lemon juice (from 1 lime or lemon)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 medium onion, diced (about 1 cup)", "1 medium leek, white and tender green parts, diced (about 1 cup)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 medium zucchini, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 3 cups)", "1 pound asparagus, tough ends discarded and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 3 cups)", "1 pound fresh peas in the pod, shucked (1 1/2 cups)", "3 pounds fresh fava beans in the pod, shucked and peeled (about 1 cup), optional", "10 ounces baby spinach or mizuna greens (about 10 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, bring 2 1/2 cups water to a rapid boil.
