The ingredient list is long, but the labor involved in making this soup is minimal. It tastes best if you make it through step 2 a day ahead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/07/17/health/17recipehealth/17recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves: Six to eight", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, editors' pick, soups and stews", "keywords": "basil, vegetables, white beans, healthy, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 93}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups white beans, soaked for six hours in 6 cups water and drained", "2 quarts water", "1 large onion, chopped", "4 large garlic cloves, minced or pressed", "A bouquet garni made with a few sprigs each thyme and parsley, a Parmesan rind and a bay leaf", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "2 leeks, white and light green part only, cleaned and sliced", "1 pound tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped, or 1 14-ounce can, with liquid", "2 cups shredded savoy or green cabbage", "2 large carrots, diced", "2 celery stalks, diced", "1 medium-size zucchini, scrubbed and diced", "2 medium-size turnips, peeled and diced", "1/2 pound green beans, trimmed and broken into 1-inch pieces (about 2 cups), blanched for five minutes and set aside", "1/2 cup soup pasta, such as macaroni or small shells", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 large garlic cloves, halved, green shoots removed", "Salt to taste", "2 cups, tightly packed, fresh basil leaves", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan", "Freshly ground pepper", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain the white beans and combine with 2 quarts water in a large, heavy soup pot or Dutch oven.
