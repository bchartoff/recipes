{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Frogmore Stew", "description": "Frogmore Stew, often called a Lowcountry boil, is open to great variation. The essentials are the freshest shrimp you can find, preferably from the southeastern Atlantic coast or the Gulf of Mexico. You will also need kielbasa or similar sausage, and corn on the cob. Ben Mo\u00efse, a South Carolinian who has been making it the same way more than 30 years, insists on only those three ingredients, and employs frozen three-inch cobs from the supermarket. Fresh corn works as well, and you can add new potatoes, onions or other vegetables for \u201cgilding the lily,\u201d as he says. Serve the stew with beer, coleslaw and a ketchup-based cocktail sauce heavy with horseradish and lemon. This recipe can easily be adjusted for more or fewer people.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/01/dining/01BOIL1/01BOIL1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 173}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 777, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "2223 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ears fresh corn on the cob, or 12 3-inch frozen cobettes", "1 1/2 cups Old Bay or other commercial shrimp boil seasoning", "2 pounds kielbasa or similar sausage (about 5 ounces per person)", "2 1/2 pounds fresh 36- to 40-count shrimp in the shell, heads removed (about 6 ounces per person)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using fresh corn, shuck and remove silks.
