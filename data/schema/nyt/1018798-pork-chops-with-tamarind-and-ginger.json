Then the excess marinade is mixed into the drippings to make a heady sauce. If you can\u2019t find tamarind concentrate (also sometimes called tamarind extract), lime juice will supply the sour notes, though without the same fruity complexity.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/21/dining/21APPETITE1/21APPETITE1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, steaks and chops", "keywords": "fish sauce, fresh ginger, ground tumeric, pork chops, sambal oelek, scallions, tamarind, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 481}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 287, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "444 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 tablespoon tamarind concentrate (or extract), or use lime juice", "1 tablespoon sambal oelek or other chile paste", "2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 teaspoon fish sauce", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 bone-in pork chops, 1 1/2 inches thick (2 pounds total)", "2 tablespoons coconut oil, grapeseed oil or safflower oil", "Scallions, thinly sliced", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine garlic, tamarind, sambal oelek, ginger, salt, cumin, fish sauce and turmeric.
