{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Noodles With Egg Drop Gravy\u00a0", "description": "This recipe is reminiscent of wat tan hor, a Cantonese, Singaporean and Malaysian meat and fresh rice noodle dish that\u2019s topped with a silky egg gravy. Wat tan means \u201csmooth egg\u201d in Cantonese, describing the velvety gravy that smothers the noodles. In this vegetarian riff, pantry-friendly dry rice noodles are used. The silky texture of the sauce is achieved by adding cornstarch slurry, a common technique in Chinese cooking, followed by beaten eggs, which cook the moment they hit the hot gravy and become long, irregular strands. For extra heartiness, add slices of pan-fried tofu or extra vegetables like broccoli or cauliflower.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/15/dining/hm-Rice-Noodles-With-Egg-Drop-Gravy/hm-Rice-Noodles-With-Egg-Drop-Gravy--articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "bok choy, dark soy sauce, egg, rice noodles, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 470}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "12 ounces thick dried rice noodles", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon dark soy sauce (see Tip)", "2 cups vegetable stock", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "1 carrot, peeled and thinly sliced diagonally", "4 heads baby bok choy (about 12 ounces), trimmed and sliced lengthwise into 4 pieces", "2 tablespoons vegetarian stir-fry sauce or oyster sauce", "2 eggs, beaten", "Handful of cilantro leaves (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil.
