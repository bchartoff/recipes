Mix together water, grainy mustard and any fruit preserve that\u2019s good with pork like cherry, fig, peach or apricot. Sear bone-in pork chops mostly on one side to prevent overcooking, then pour the fruit-mustard mixture into the skillet while they rest. The pork will stay moist, and its juices will have time to mingle with the sauce. Then just slice the pork and drape it in the velvety two-ingredient glaze. Eat with mashed or roasted potatoes and a green salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/18/dining/as-Pork-Chops-With-Jammy-Mustard-Sauce/merlin_199987296_a37f7378-8585-46d2-8fa1-4dfa596790d4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, meat, main course", "keywords": "pork chops, preserves, whole-grain mustard", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1077}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons cherry, fig, peach or apricot preserves, plus more if needed", "2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard, plus more if needed", "4 (1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick) pork rib chops (1 1/2 to 2 pounds)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons neutral oil (such as canola or grapeseed)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, stir together 1/4 cup water, the preserves and the mustard.
