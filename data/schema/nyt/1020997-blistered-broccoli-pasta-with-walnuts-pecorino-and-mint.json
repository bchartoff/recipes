{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blistered Broccoli Pasta With Walnuts, Pecorino and Mint", "description": "The trick to creating deeply browned, pan-seared broccoli involves two things: high heat and no touching. Allowing your florets and stems to sear in an even layer, undisturbed, gives them time to blister without cooking all the way through, so they retain some crunch. While many pasta sauces are finished with starchy pasta water, this one isn\u2019t, since the hot water would strip the broccoli of that color and crunch you worked so hard to achieve. Instead, toss the cooked pasta in the skillet with the broccoli, walnuts and cheese. A drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon will provide any additional moisture you need.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/dining/15Pasta-Broccoli-a/merlin_171317121_793618ff-68ff-4a5f-908f-2b79c9453cc1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, pastas, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "broccoli, lemon, mint, pasta, walnut, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1142}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "12 ounces riccioli, fusilli or other short pasta", "1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1/2 cup walnuts or pecans, chopped", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1 bunch broccoli or cauliflower (about 1 1/2 pounds untrimmed), florets roughly chopped and stalks peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1 lemon, zested (about 1 teaspoon) then quartered", "1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan, plus more for serving", "1 cup packed fresh mint leaves or parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
