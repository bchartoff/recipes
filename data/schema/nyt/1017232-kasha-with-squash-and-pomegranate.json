{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kasha With Squash and Pomegranate", "description": "This salad works equally well with kasha or freekeh, both of which have a nutty-earthy flavor that serves as a great backdrop for sweet roasted butternut squash and sweet-tart, crunchy pomegranate seeds. Lately I have gotten into the habit of roasting diced butternut squash to keep on hand in the refrigerator for a few days; I usually don\u2019t know in advance what I am going to use it for; then one night it finds its way  into a salad like this one, the next night into a risotto, and so on until it is time to roast up another one. Four cups diced squash looks like a lot, but it reduces down to about 1 1/2 cups when you roast it, so you will use it up quickly (I use all of it, for example, in this salad).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/14/science/recipehealthkasha/recipehealthkasha-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 41}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 503, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "77 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "485 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium butternut squash (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled, seeded and cut into small dice (about 1/2 inch), about 4 cups", "6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt to taste", "4 cups cooked <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017205-kasha\">kasha</a> or freekeh", "1/2 cup pecans, lightly toasted", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds (more to taste)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley or mint, or a combination", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "2 tablespoons walnut oil (more to taste)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
