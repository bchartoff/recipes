{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Watermelon Margarita", "description": "Mixing cocktails may seem intimidating, but it\u2019s actually quite intuitive once you understand how to balance the alcohol, sweetness and acidity. In \u201c3-Ingredient Cocktails\u201d (Ten Speed Press, 2017), Robert Simonson presents the formula for a perfect margarita: 1\u00bd ounces tequila, 1 ounce Cointreau and 3/4 ounce lime juice, shaken and served. Even easier to memorize, this version uses 6 ounces fresh watermelon juice \u2014 a sweet but subtle nod to summer \u2014 and 2 ounces each tequila, Cointreau and lime juice. Be sure to taste and add more watermelon juice if your margarita is too boozy, and extra lime juice or even a pinch of salt if it\u2019s too sweet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/30/dining/watermelon-margarita/watermelon-margarita-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "2 drinks", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cointreau, jalape\u00f1o, lime, tequila, watermelon, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1017}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon Taj\u00edn or 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne (optional)", "Ice, as needed", "6 ounces fresh watermelon juice (from about 1 1/2 cups chopped seedless watermelon, blended and strained)", "2 ounces tequila, preferably blanco", "2 ounces Cointreau (optional)", "2 ounces fresh lime juice (from 1 to 2 large limes), rinds reserved", "2 to 3 thinly sliced jalape\u00f1o rounds (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the salted rim, if using: In a small shallow bowl or plate, combine the sea salt and Taj\u00edn.
