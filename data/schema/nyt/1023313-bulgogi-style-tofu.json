It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nPerhaps I\u2019ll go off-road, and cook in the no-recipe recipe style. Maybe you\u2019ll join me? I\u2019ll give you the prompt: <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017444-bulgogi-korean-grilled-beef\">bulgogi</a>-style tofu. It\u2019s simple. Press some firm tofu to extract as much liquid as you can. Make a marinade of soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, a spoonful of gochujang, a splash of neutral oil, some sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds. Slice the tofu into bite-size cubes, and slide them into the marinade. Let that sit \u2014 a half-hour works; a few hours works better. Then roast them in a hot oven on an oiled foil-lined pan until they\u2019re crisp. Serve with bibb lettuce cups to wrap them in, with rice, kimchi and a dipping sauce of ssamjang and a little bit more gochujang thinned out with neutral oil and sherry vinegar. (If not, go with sesame oil and ground white pepper.) That\u2019s a fine dinner.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.<i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/11/dining/ss-bulgogi-style-tofu/merlin_209335170_48189dad-00d2-46b3-8673-e540119aacf3-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, weeknight, finger foods, main course", "keywords": "gochujang, sesame oil, soy sauce, tofu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1576}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null, "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023313-bulgogi-style-tofu"}
