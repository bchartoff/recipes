It could perch easily on a slice of pecan, apple or even pumpkin pie, dripping lusciously down the sides. Although rum is used here, any dark brown spirit will work \u2014 particularly bourbon or brandy. Or if you want to leave out the booze, substitute orange juice and stir a little grated orange zest into the custard as it cooks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/28/dining/rumicecream-still/rumicecream-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "About 1 quart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "chocolate, dried cranberries, eggs, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 234, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "130 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup dried cranberries", "1/4 cup dark rum", "6 large egg yolks", "134 grams sugar (about 3/4 cup)", "2 1/3 cups whole milk", "1 cup heavy cream", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 ounces chocolate chunks, chopped", "35 grams toasted walnuts, chopped (about 1/3 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine the cranberries and dark rum.
