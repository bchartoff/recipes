{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carrot Ring", "description": "A cross between a carrot cake and a carrot pudding, this velvety, warm, gently sweet side dish is a classic Jewish holiday offering. This version is adapted from Dana Green of Benicia, Calif., who got it from her grandmother. \"Everyone who encounters it is wary of the name, carrot ring, but they end up loving it, they have seconds,\" Ms. Green said. You can make this ahead by allowing the ring to cool in the pan, then wrapping the whole thing in plastic wrap, pan and all, and freezing it for up to one month. Let thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Unwrap and reheat in a 300-degree oven for about 30 minutes or so before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/21/dining/21COOKING-CARROTRING2/21COOKING-CARROTRING2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "carrot, dark brown sugar, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 286}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 215, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "130 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup shortening or unsalted butter, plus more for the pan", "4 medium carrots, peeled and sliced", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 to 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, to taste", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "Pinch of salt", "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
