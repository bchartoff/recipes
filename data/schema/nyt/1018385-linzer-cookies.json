{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Linzer Cookies", "description": "Lightly spiced, jam-filled linzer cookies (a smaller version of the classic\u00a0linzer torte) are a traditional sandwich cookie with a tender texture and subtle nutty flavor that comes from finely ground almonds in the dough. As with sugar cookies, which benefit from the addition of frosting, the dough for a linzer does not need to be too sweet: It's filled with a tangy raspberry jam and finished with plenty of powdered sugar. A hole in the top of the cookie gives the signature stained-glass-window effect, making it one of the most effortless and impressive treats you could make this holiday season.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/18/dining/AR-linzer-cookies/merlin_148112754_848e3f58-b9f8-4a66-8181-d0533ff13cc2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 2 1/2 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "almonds, cinnamon, eggs, flour, raspberry jam, sugar, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 468}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "84 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/435 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/155 grams raw, skin-on almonds (or 3/4 cup/75 grams almond flour)", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams unsalted butter (3 sticks)", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup/290 grams raspberry jam", "Powdered sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pulse together flour and almonds in a food processor until the almonds are very finely ground.
