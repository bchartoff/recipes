To bring out the soft meatiness of the eggplant, roast cubes of it until they collapse into a caramelized heap, and toss them with chopped raw tomatoes and a handful of salty capers. Then dress the vegetables and pasta in the pungent, spicy oil, which is rich with anchovies, browned garlic and chiles, a strong contrast to the sweetness of the tomatoes and eggplant.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/23/dining/penneeggplant/penneeggplant-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "dairy-free, eggplant, pasta, tomato, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 501}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 854, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "113 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "16 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "916 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 and 1/2 pounds eggplant (about 4 medium), cut into 1-inch cubes", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, more as needed", "1 very large ripe tomato, cored and diced (1 and 1/2 cups)", "1/2 pound dried penne", "3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "3 anchovy fillets", "Large pinch chile flakes", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "Freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1/4 cup torn basil leaves", "2 tablespoons torn mint leaves", "2 tablespoons finely chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
