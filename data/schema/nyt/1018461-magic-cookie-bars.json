You\u2019ve  seen these classic treats at bake sales, holiday parties and potlucks over the years. But they tend to crumble when cut, thanks to a thin graham cracker crust. And, topped with gobs of super-sweet shredded coconut, sweetened condensed milk and semisweet chocolate, they have a cloying bite that may be too much for even the sweetest tooth. This version starts with a thicker graham cracker cookie base. It's baked with an egg, a bit of brown sugar and some leavener, which makes it pleasantly dense and chewy and means that it cuts nicely and stands up well to the decadent toppings. Next, unsweetened flaked coconut and dark chocolate are layered with plenty of chopped pecans and condensed milk. The slightly bitter chocolate and toasty coconut tame the sweetness of the condensed milk, which caramelizes as it cooks, making the whole package well-balanced and full of flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/05/dining/05COOKING-COCONUTDREAMBAR1/05COOKING-COCONUTDREAMBAR1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "15 bars", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, graham cracker, pecans, sweetened condensed milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 901}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 393, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "214 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly,  more for greasing the pan", "20 graham crackers (about 310 grams)", "1/4 cup/50 grams packed light or dark brown sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 large egg", "1 14-ounce/397 gram can sweetened condensed milk\u00a0", "8 ounces/227 grams chopped bittersweet chocolate (1 1/2 cups)", "1 cup/110 grams chopped pecans", "2 cups/114 grams unsweetened flaked coconut"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
