{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jamaican-Spiced Turkey", "description": "When Francine Turone hosted her first Thanksgiving dinner in New York City, she declared turkey \u201cbland and boring.\u201d But after friends protested, she came up with this recipe inspired by her upbringing in Kingston, Jamaica. This turkey, a showstopping centerpiece for any big family event, roasts on a bed of whole vegetables, which absorb its fat. A deeply spiced brine and rub packed with cinnamon, allspice berries, thyme and chile pepper imparts huge flavors, rounded out by an herb-infused brown butter. If things are looking to be busy, the butter and rub can be prepared a day ahead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/dining/COOKING-JERK1/COOKING-JAMAICAN1-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "fall, herbs, spices, turkey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 45}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups kosher salt", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "5 cloves garlic, lightly crushed and peeled", "1 large Spanish or Vidalia onion, peeled and quartered", "20 fresh thyme sprigs (or 2 tablespoons dried)", "8 whole cloves", "1 tablespoon allspice berries, lightly crushed", "2 bay leaves", "6 sage leaves", "1 stick cinnamon", "5 to 6 scallions, white and green parts, halved crosswise", "3 to 4 juniper berries, lightly crushed", "1 15- to 18-pound turkey (preferably heritage or pasture-raised)", "1 1/4 cups unsalted butter (2 1/2 sticks)", "20 fresh thyme sprigs", "1/4 cup chopped scallions (about 3), white and green parts", "1/2 cinnamon stick, broken into pieces", "2 tablespoons allspice berries", "1 tablespoon whole peppercorns", "1/2 tablespoon dried thyme", "1/2 dried mild or medium hot chile pepper (such as guajillo), stem removed, torn into pieces", "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds", "5 scallions, trimmed", "3 onions, peeled and quartered", "3 celery stalks (with tops)", "2 fennel bulbs (with stems and fronds), cut into thirds", "10 garlic cloves", "3 large carrots, trimmed and peeled", "Salt and pepper", "3 cups vegetable or chicken stock"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brine the turkey: Combine all the brine ingredients except the turkey in a large stock pot and add 1 gallon water.
