{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Middle Eastern Pita and Vegetable Salad (Fattoush)", "description": "Flat breads become stale very quickly, so it\u2019s no surprise that there\u2019s an array of Arab dishes made with crumbled up pitas. This is my favorite destination for them (I love any dish where bread is soaked with salad dressing). You can use whatever greens look good in your market -- arugula, watercress, purslane, and cut up leaves of romaine lettuce are all acceptable. The Middle Eastern spice sumac is available in Middle Eastern markets; the salad will still be delicious if you don\u2019t include it. To keep the fat a little lower I\u2019ve substituted plain low-fat yogurt for some of the olive oil in the authentic recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/19/dining/breadsalad/breadsalad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8 generously", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 139, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "241 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3  (6-inch) Arabic pita breads", "1 large garlic clove, finely chopped or pureed (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup plain lowfat yogurt", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 pound tomatoes, coarsely chopped", "1 European cucumber or 3 Persian cucumbers, cut in half lengthwise, then into half-moon slices", "6 scallions, white and light green parts, sliced", "1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "1/4 cup slivered fresh mint leaves", "1 romaine lettuce heart (the lighter, inner leaves), washed, dried, cut crosswise in 1/2-inch wide pieces", "4 cups (loosely packed) coarsely chopped arugula, watercress, or purslane (or a combination),", "2 teaspoons ground sumac (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If your pita breads are hard, break them up into pieces.
