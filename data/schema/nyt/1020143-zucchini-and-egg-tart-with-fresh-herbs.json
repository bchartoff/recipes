When you\u2019re rolling out puff pastry, thin flatbread or any other flattened dough, invert the baking sheet so you can unfurl the dough directly on it without the rim getting in the way of your rolling pin. Then parbake the tart without toppings first so that the base cooks through before it\u2019s slathered with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, piled with a mess of vegetables and eggs, and returned to the oven to finish. (You\u2019ll want to bake just until the whites of the eggs start to look glossy and custardy, not firm.) Top with any torn, tender herbs you have on hand, like small parsley sprigs, chives, tarragon or dill, cut into quarters, and serve warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/31/dining/31food/merlin_152985294_e7de9b23-6bc4-47f5-9ee9-235a87617412-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, pies and tarts", "keywords": "cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, dijon mustard, eggs, lemon, peas, scallion, zucchini, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 296}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 750, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "752 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 large eggs", "1 (14-ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed", "2 medium zucchini (6 to 7 ounces each), sliced lengthwise into 6 slabs, about 1/4-inch-thick each", "8 scallions, trimmed", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/3 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or mascarpone", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest", "1/3 cup frozen peas, thawed", "Any combination of fresh tarragon, small parsley or dill sprigs, and chopped chives, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
