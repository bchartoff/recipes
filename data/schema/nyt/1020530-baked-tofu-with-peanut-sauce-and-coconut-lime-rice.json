{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Tofu With Peanut Sauce and Coconut-Lime Rice", "description": "A spicy, fragrant peanut sauce reminiscent of the groundnut stews that are popular across West Africa anchors this recipe. Any protein would be lucky to be doused and marinated in it, but tofu soaks up the peanut sauce\u2019s flavors and chars up nicely upon roasting. The tofu\u2019s neutral flavor allows the other flavors in the dish to break through. Red miso and fish sauce provide umami, honey lends a subtle sweetness and the lime zest in the coconut rice brightens it all. Finished with pickled peppers and fresh sliced scallions, this dish comes together to make an exciting but quick weeknight dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/dining/yk-tofu-mafe/merlin_162370185_6b0e9f42-5885-4cd3-b8bb-9e3e0e0a9ef2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice, vegetables", "keywords": "bell pepper, ginger, jasmine rice, lime, peanut butter, red miso, tofu, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 868}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil, plus more for brushing the pan and drizzling", "2/3 cup lime juice (from about 5 limes), and zest of 1 lime", "Kosher salt", "8 baby bell peppers or 1 medium bell pepper (any color will do), stemmed and thinly sliced lengthwise", "Black pepper", "1 cup long-grain rice like jasmine or basmati", "1/2 cup full-fat coconut milk", "1 cup smooth, natural peanut butter", "1 tablespoon red miso", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)", "2 teaspoons chopped habanero pepper, stem and seeds removed, or 1 tablespoon sambal", "2 tablespoons buckwheat honey or molasses", "2 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and sliced crosswise, 1/4-inch thick", "3 cups peppery greens, like arugula, mizuna or baby mustard greens", "2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees and lightly brush a large rimmed sheet pan with oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, stir 4 tablespoons lime juice with 1/2 teaspoon salt until salt dissolves.
