{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Portobello Patty Melts", "description": "This is a traditional patty melt in all ways save the fact that the beef has been swapped out for roasted portobello-mushroom caps. It otherwise hews closely to the recipe served at Tiny Naylor\u2019s drive-in restaurant in Los Angeles in the 1950s, and to the ones used in coffee shops and diners across the country. But those mushrooms! Roasted in the oven in a marinade of oil, balsamic vinegar, soy and garlic, they take on immense flavor and density, and provide a terrific foil to the caramelized onions, Swiss cheese and butter-griddled rye bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/04/magazine/04portobello2/04portobello2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches", "keywords": "onion, portobello, swiss cheese", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 461}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 450, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "807 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "8 slices seeded rye bread", "8 slices Swiss cheese, approximately 1/2 pound", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "1 minced garlic clove", "8 clean portobello caps"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Caramelize onions.
