{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stone Fruit Jam", "description": "When it comes to summertime stone fruit, pies are often the first thing to come to mind, but jam made with peaches, plums and apricots is just as delicious and lasts much longer. Naturally rich in pectin and high in acidity, these fruits make for jam with rich textures and the best balance of sweet and tart. When choosing your fruit, look for pieces that are just ripe rather than overly ripe, as stone fruit tends to lose pectin and acidity the older it gets.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/07/dining/07JAMGUIDE2/07JAMGUIDE2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 4 cups (4 8-ounce jars)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "apricot, nectarine, peach, plum, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 61}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 1/2 pounds/2 kilograms peaches, nectarines, plums or apricots, pitted, sliced or cut into 1-inch chunks", "2 3/4 cups/550 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice (from about 2 lemons or limes)", "Add-ins (optional, see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss fruit and sugar together in a large, heavy-bottomed pot.

You\u2019ll notice the liquid go from a rapid, rolling boil with smaller bubbles to a slow, thick, tarlike boil with larger bubbles. This is the stage at which it\u2019s most important to stir constantly along the bottom of the pot to prevent scorching and sticking.
