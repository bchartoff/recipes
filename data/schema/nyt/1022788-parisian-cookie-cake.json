{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Parisian Cookie Cake", "description": "A cross between an American chocolate chip cookie and a French shortbread, this treat was inspired by one created by Fran\u00e7ois Perret, the pastry chef of the Ritz hotel in Paris and its patisserie, Le Comptoir. Chewy and crunchy, this cookie as big as a cake is as much fun to eat as it is to make. The base is sweet, tender and caramel-flavored from turbinado sugar. You also catch a bit of nuttiness: That\u2019s the almond butter that\u2019s mixed into it. It\u2019s delicious and intentionally plain because all the excitement is on the top of the cookie, which is paved with chopped almonds and chunks of chocolate, dabbed with caramel and sprinkled with fleur de sel.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/05/magazine/05mag-eat-site/05mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 cookies\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "american, french", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "almonds, caramel, chocolate, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 881}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups/170 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "4 ounces/113 grams very soft unsalted butter", "3/4 cup/150 grams turbinado sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 tablespoons/54 grams pure almond butter, well stirred\u00a0", "1 large egg, at room temperature and lightly beaten", "4 ounces/113 grams semi or bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped", "1/3 cup/48 grams raw almonds, coarsely chopped\u00a0", "About 3 tablespoons/about 60 grams caramel topping, for finishing", "Fleur de sel, for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven and heat to 350 degrees.
