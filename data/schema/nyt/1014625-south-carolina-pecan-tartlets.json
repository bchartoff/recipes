We had the vague idea of cooking a holiday feast to celebrate the season \u2014 one that was grand and nondenominational \u2014 that would help banish memories of winter. These little pecan tarts helped a great deal. They're ideal for dinner parties, and reward the use of fresh Southern pecans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton And Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/16/dining/16COOKING-SC-PECAN-TARTLETS1/16COOKING-SC-PECAN-TARTLETS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, eggs, pecans, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 265, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "52 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups shelled pecans or walnuts", "5 eggs", "3/4 cup white sugar", "1/2 cup brown sugar", "Pinch salt", "6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter, melted", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375.
