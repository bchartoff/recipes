{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Boxty (Irish Potato Pancakes)", "description": "Boxty, breadlike potato pancakes that originated in Ireland as early as the late 18th century, were created as a resourceful way to transform less-than-stellar potatoes into a hearty side dish. Variations of these crisp, chewy potato pancakes abound, but most involve some combination of mashed potatoes, grated potatoes, flour, baking soda or baking powder; buttermilk or eggs are sometimes added for richness. Popular in pubs but also made at home, they\u2019re typically served as an accompaniment to stews and rich meat dishes. This recipe is adapted from \u201cThe Irish Cookbook\u201d by Jp McMahon (Phaidon, 2020), who serves them in a more modern fashion, with smoked salmon, sour cream and pickled onions, which balance and brighten.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/aw-boxty/merlin_170015676_abe38e61-3506-4f73-8493-f30ee1e3b5ce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 12 pancakes", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weeknight, breads, vegetables", "keywords": "apple cider vinegar, butter, buttermilk, flour, potato, red onion, sugar, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 127}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 small red onion", "1/4 cup apple cider vinegar", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "2 pounds all-purpose potatoes, preferably Rooster or Yukon gold", "1 cup buttermilk", "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "4 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, as needed", "Smoked salmon and sour cream, for serving\u00a0(optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pickled red onions: Slice the red onion thinly from stem to stem, then transfer slices to a small heatproof bowl.
