{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bunker\u2019s Love Affair", "description": "The cocktails made at Wassail, a cider bar on the Lower East Side, use not only cider, but also other spirits derived from apples, such as Calvados and Pommeau, which is a mix of apple juice and Calvados. Bunker\u2019s Love Affair, created by Wassail\u2019s head bartender, Jade Brown-Godfrey, combines all three. The drink is boozy and fruity in equal measure. The multiple layers of apple flavor are cut by the bitter gentian backbone of the Suze (which, like all the ingredients in this cocktail, is French). The drink is named in honor of John Bunker, a Maine pomologist who has worked to preserve older varieties of apples.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/13/dining/13CIDER1/13CIDER1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "for one", "keywords": "calvados, cider", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce Suze liqueur", "1 ounce Calvados", "1 ounce Pommeau", "2 ounces cider, preferably Christian Drouin", "Grapefruit twist"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing glass filled three-quarters with ice, stir the Suze, Calvados and Pommeau until chilled, about 30 seconds.
