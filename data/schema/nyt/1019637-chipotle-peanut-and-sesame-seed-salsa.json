{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chipotle, Peanut and Sesame Seed Salsa", "description": "This nutty, spicy salsa with the tang of vinegar is from Veracruz, Mexico, where it\u2019s called salsa macha. It has long been a favorite of Pati Jinich, the Mexican-born chef who lives in Washington, D.C. Her version comes together fast, and offers a lot of character and versatility. Use it to liven up roasted vegetables or grilled meats. It\u2019s especially great on lamb chops and skirt steak, or even baked potatoes served with sour cream and cheese. The salsa lasts for a couple of weeks in the refrigerator; the solids will sink to the bottom, leaving a deeply flavored oil that can add a little muscle to sauces or a finishing touch to other dishes. You can use other nuts in place of the peanuts,\u00a0or a mix of nuts and sunflower or pumpkin seeds.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/10jinichrex1/merlin_144843525_2cbd3b14-3ec5-4067-90ae-43f40291a8f2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "quick, dips and spreads", "keywords": "chipotle, peanut, sesame seeds, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 37}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 152, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "53 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups olive oil\u00a0", "1/2 cup raw unsalted peanuts (or\u00a0use pecans, hazelnuts or walnuts)", "4 garlic cloves, peeled", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds", "2 ounces dried chipotle chiles (1 1/2 to 2 cups), stemmed and seeded", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste", "1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste", "3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil over medium heat in a 12-inch skillet until it is very hot but not smoking.
