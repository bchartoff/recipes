{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pepper-Cumin Cookies", "description": "These cookies combine the banality of white sugar with the intensity of black pepper, the tartness of lemon zest and the pungency of cumin. When served with fruit \u2014 fresh, roasted or stewed \u2014 they will emphasize the fruit's natural sugariness. But when accompanied by a strong cheese like Roquefort or Stilton, the cookies turn indisputably sweet. Alone, they're a delightful combination of savory-sweet-spicy, reminiscent of a rosemary shortbread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/31/dining/11COOKING-PEPPER-CUMIN-COOKIES/11COOKING-PEPPER-CUMIN-COOKIES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "30 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, crackers and chips", "keywords": "black peppercorns, cumin seeds, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 103}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 95, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "44 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups all-purpose flour", "6 tablespoons sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns, cracked", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds, cracked", "1 cup unsalted butter, softened slightly and cut into pieces", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
