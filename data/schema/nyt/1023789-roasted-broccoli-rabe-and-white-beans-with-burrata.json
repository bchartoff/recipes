{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Broccoli Rabe and White Beans With Burrata", "description": "With just a few ingredients, this impressive and quick dish boasts many flavors and textures. Roasting broccoli rabe creates tender stems while the leaves crisp like chips. The broccoli rabe cooks alongside paprika-stained white beans, which become warm, creamy and even crisp in spots as they roast. Eat the beans and greens warm or at room temperature, as a starter or vegetarian main, with slices of orange and a puddle of creamy burrata for softness and sweetness. (You could also use ricotta, thick yogurt or avocado instead of the burrata.) This dish is good on its own, or with farro, pearl couscous or crusty bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/04/multimedia/as-bitter-greens-with-citrus-and-burrata-1-4e66/as-bitter-greens-with-citrus-and-burrata-1-4e66-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "beans, broccoli rabe, burrata, extra virgin olive oil, smoked paprika, vegetables, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 80}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound burrata", "1 bunch broccoli rabe (about 1 pound), tough ends removed, halved crosswise", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "Salt and black pepper", "1 (15-ounce) can white beans, rinsed and patted very dry", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika\u00a0", "2 oranges\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Take the burrata out of the fridge to let it warm to room temperature.
