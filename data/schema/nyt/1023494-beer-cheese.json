{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beer Cheese", "description": "Some say this classic pub snack originated in Kentucky, but you can typically find it in bars all around, usually served with warm pretzel bites or vegetables. There are two different styles of beer cheese: a spreadable, thick version and a creamier fondue-style type like this one. Though optional, adding a bit of miso brings out the beer flavor and adds a bit of saltiness that eliminates the need to add any salt to the dish. Either way, make sure to choose a beer that tastes good to you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Romel Bruno"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/21/dining/rb-beer-cheese/merlin_213556083_d910b438-5372-4af4-a9c7-433496ed2f0b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "About 4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "beer, make-ahead, sharp cheddar cheese, super bowl, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 181}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon yellow miso paste, optional", "1 (12-oz can) Pilsner beer (or light beer of your choice)", "1 cup whole milk", "1 pound sharp Cheddar, shredded (about 4 cups)", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)", "Salt (if not using miso)", "Pretzel sticks, cut-up vegetables or crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan on medium-low heat, melt the butter, then add the flour and whisk until smooth.
