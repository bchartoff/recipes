{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Steak Hach\u00e9", "description": "Salisbury steak is an instance of an old recipe with enduring value. It is a good idea and a good name, though its reputation as a TV dinner has stained the prettiness somewhat. All that the old recipe \u2014 and its many variations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0needed was a little updating. Here is a Frenchier and more contemporary version\u00a0\u2014\u00a0rich with porcini butter, piquant with salsa verde. It is old-fashioned enough to be fun and elegant enough for a dinner party\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and most definitely does not need a hamburger bun.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/18/magazine/18mag-eat1/18mag-eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "capers, ground sirloin, parmesan, parsley, porcini, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 106}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 570, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "493 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried porcini mushrooms", "1 pound best ground sirloin or chuck", "5 tablespoons butter, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons finely chopped white onion", "1 egg, beaten", "Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese", "1 tablespoon red-wine vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon capers, finely chopped", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley", "Olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the mushrooms in enough boiling water to cover them for 20 minutes, then drain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, and finely chop.
