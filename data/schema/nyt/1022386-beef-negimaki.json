{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef Negimaki", "description": "Negimaki is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of thinly pounded meat that\u2019s marinated in teriyaki sauce, wrapped around scallions and grilled. (Negi is the Japanese word for scallions; maki means roll.) Although beef is traditionally used for these tasty appetizers, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013203-chicken-negimaki\">chicken</a> is a popular alternative. These can be assembled a few hours ahead and kept refrigerated until ready to grill. To make a complete meal, serve the negimaki with steamed rice and a simple green salad or roasted broccoli. Any leftovers can be chopped and tossed into fried rice the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/03/dining/kc-beef-negimaki/merlin_197671455_445ac70d-2752-4a7f-bf2a-855d56a8fd9d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "meat", "keywords": "flank steak, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 297}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "12 scallions, trimmed and halved crosswise", "Ice", "1/3 cup soy sauce", "1/3 cup mirin", "1/3 cup sake", "1/3 cup turbinado sugar, or 1/4 cup granulated sugar", "1 pound flank steak (about a 6- to 7-inch square in size)", "Vegetable oil, for greasing grates"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saucepan of salted boiling water, blanch lighter scallion ends for 1 minute, then add darker green scallion ends and blanch for 1 minute longer.
