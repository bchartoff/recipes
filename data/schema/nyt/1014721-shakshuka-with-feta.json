(It also makes excellent brunch or lunch food.) It\u2019s a one-skillet recipe of eggs baked in a tomato-red pepper sauce spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne. First you make that sauce, which comes together fairly quickly on top of the stove, then you gently crack each of the eggs into the pan, nestling them into the sauce. The pan is moved into the oven to finish. Shakshuka originated in North Africa, and like many great dishes there are as many versions as there are cooks who have embraced it. This one strays from more traditional renditions by adding crumbled feta cheese, which softens into creamy nuggets in the oven\u2019s heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/dining/mc-shakshuka/mc-shakshuka-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, eggs, feta, kosher, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 6160}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 261, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "640 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1 large red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne, or to taste", "1 (28-ounce) can whole plum tomatoes with their juices, coarsely chopped", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed", "5 ounces feta, crumbled (about 1 1/4 cups)", "6 large eggs", "Chopped cilantro, for serving", "Hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
