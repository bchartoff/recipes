{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Harissa and White Bean Chili", "description": "The key to achieving depth of flavor in this fresh, nontraditional, 30-minute chili recipe is layering ingredients with bold condiments that do most of the work for you. Here, soy sauce and harissa are used to provide umami, spice and heat. Finish the chili as you\u2019d like, topping it with all of the suggestions below, or skipping the yogurt and feta to keep it vegan. The chili will thicken as it sits, so add a little water when reheating. If you don\u2019t like tomato skins or don\u2019t want to buy fresh tomatoes, substitute 2 tablespoons of tomato paste for the tomatoes, adding it with the harissa. For a more substantial meal, serve with rice or bread, or double the recipe for leftovers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/31/dining/yf-white-bean-chili/merlin_200578281_49795a3c-b64c-4a34-b7ba-c50f4162da86-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weekday, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, cherry tomato, chili, dutch oven, harissa, soy sauce, spinach, white bean, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1484}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 small red onion, diced", "2 red or orange bell peppers, seeded and diced", "2 jalape\u00f1os (1 seeded and diced, 1 sliced into thin rounds for garnish)", "Kosher salt", "1 (10-ounce) container cherry or grape tomatoes (1 pint)", "1 to 2 tablespoons harissa, depending on heat preference", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "2 garlic cloves, grated or minced", "2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "2 (15-ounce) cans white beans, such as cannellini or great Northern, drained and rinsed", "2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth", "Black pepper", "3 packed cups baby spinach", "2 limes, 1 halved, 1 cut into wedges for serving", "Full-fat yogurt or sour cream, for serving", "1 avocado, sliced or cubed, for serving", "1/4 cup packed cilantro or parsley leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped or torn, for serving", "1/2 cup crumbled feta or grated Parmesan or mozzarella, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a Dutch oven or large pot, heat the oil over medium-high until shimmering.
