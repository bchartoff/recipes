{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Chicken Thighs With Peppers, Capers and Olives", "description": "The Italian technique employed here \u2014 saut\u00e9ing chicken with a weighted pan on top \u2014 is called al mattone. It yields a crisp, burnished skin and very juicy meat. Instead of the usual spatchcocked bird, this recipe calls for large bone-in, skin-on thighs. Cook them in a cast iron pan, if you can, for even heat, but any heavy skillet will do. For a bit of smokiness, the chicken may be cooked (in the cast iron pan) over a charcoal grill. The accompanying sweet pepper stew can be made up to a day in advance and reheated, and starting your seasoning early \u2014 an hour ahead or up to 24 \u2014 will result in the tastiest chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/01/dining/27Tanisrex2-chicken/merlin_193478265_bd520cc6-7575-41f2-83a3-cb1d228fb352-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, chicken thigh, olives", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 427}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, grated or minced", "2 large sprigs rosemary, very roughly chopped", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "Grated zest and juice of 1 small lemon (about 1 teaspoon zest and about 3 tablespoons juice)", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 medium red onions, sliced in 1/4-inch half-moons (about 3 cups)", "6 bell peppers, in assorted colors, if possible, sliced 3/8-inch lengthwise (about 8 cups)", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "3 garlic cloves, grated or minced", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1/2 cup green olives (like Castelvetrano)", "1/2 cup black olives (like Ni\u00e7oise)", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon capers, roughly chopped", "Pinch of dried oregano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start the chicken: Pat chicken dry and place in a large bowl.
