{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Empanadas de Chipil\u00edn", "description": "These empanadas are very common in the food stalls of the mercados and tianguis (open-air market) in the southern state of Chiapas. A plant native to Mexico, chipil\u00edn lends its leaves to stews and salsas, and is mixed into corn masa to make tortillas, tamales and empanadas in the country\u2019s center and south. Adding chipil\u00edn to masa lends a subtle herbaceousness that complements the earthiness of the corn. If you can\u2019t find it, spinach, chard or kale makes a great substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
