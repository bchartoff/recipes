She layers smoked mozzarella over a painting of rich, garlicky b\u00e9chamel and sheets of pasta, then radicchio roasted into sweetness and tossed in sauce. Saut\u00e9ed mushrooms add heft and loamy funkiness, and a mixture of Fontina and Gruy\u00e8re add zing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/Home-Made-Mushroom-Lasagna/Home-Made-Mushroom-Lasagna-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1182}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 814, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "73 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "1006 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013947-herb-oil\">herb oil</a>", "6 large shallots, peeled and minced", "1 1/2 pounds mushrooms, wild or best available oyster, shiitake, cremini, trimmed and sliced", "1 cup dry white wine", "1 softball-size head of radicchio, halved, cored and cut into 1/2-inch slices", "Kosher salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, or herb oil", "3 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "4 tablespoons flour, ideally instant or all-purpose", "3 cups whole milk", "1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1 cup Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated", "1 cup Fontina cheese, grated", "2 tablespoons best-quality truffle oil (optional)", "2 9-ounce boxes of no-boil lasagna sheets", "1 baseball-size ball of smoked mozzarella, sliced", "1 cup fresh Parmesan, grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350.
