This is doubly true of bouillabaisse, which should start with a stock so delicious that you can barely imagine improving on it. There are a few ways to do this: Grab fish bones when you see them, and make the stock incrementally. Another is to use shrimp shells. A third is to accumulate lobster bodies, which make fantastic stock. In any case, you combine whatever you have with some aromatics (thyme branches, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, peppercorns) add water and simmer for 15 to 30 minutes. Cool, strain and freeze if you like. When you're ready to make the soup, procure your seafood \u2013 pretty much any combination of fish and shellfish will do, but avoid dark-fleshed fish \u2013 and go forth. From there, it's no more difficult than making a pot of vegetable soup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/16/dining/16COOKING-BITTMAN-BOUILLABAISSE/16COOKING-BITTMAN-BOUILLABAISSE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "dairy-free, fish, shellfish, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 287}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 325, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1002 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Good olive oil, as needed", "4 to 8 thick slices good bread", "1 onion, chopped", "4 cloves garlic, chopped", "2 celery stalks, trimmed and chopped", "1 carrot, trimmed and chopped", "1 medium new potato, peeled and chopped", "1 small bulb fennel, trimmed and chopped", "1/4 teaspoon saffron, optional", "3 cups lobster or fish stock", "2 cups chopped tomatoes, with their juice (canned are O.K.)", "Salt and pepper", "1 to 1 1/2 pounds chopped boneless fish and shellfish, preferably a variety", "8 littleneck clams", "8 mussels", "2 sea scallops", "2 tablespoons Pernod or other pastis, optional", "Chopped fennel fronds, for garnish", "Chopped basil or parsley, for garnish", "Rouille, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees; brush bread liberally with olive oil, and bake on a sheet, turning once, until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes.
