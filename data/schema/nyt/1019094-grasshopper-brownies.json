{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grasshopper Brownies", "description": "The classic grasshopper cocktail is made from equal parts cr\u00e8me de menthe, cr\u00e8me de cacao, and heavy cream. Its mint-chocolatey flavors translate perfectly to all sorts of desserts. These decadent layered bars start with a super fudgy brownie base, which is covered with cr\u00e8me de menthe infused buttercream, and a shell of rich chocolate ganache tops it all off. You could certainly substitute a bit more peppermint extract (about 2 teaspoons) and skip the alcohol in the cr\u00e8me de menthe if you\u2019d like to keep these more family friendly. Peppermint extract varies quite a bit in intensity by brand, which is why a range is given, so taste as you go.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/13/dining/grasshopper-brownies/grasshopper-brownies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 8-by-8-inch pan, 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "candies, cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 465}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 374, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "99 milligrams", "sugarContent": "38 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces/227 grams bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup/165 grams light brown sugar", "1/4 cup/24 grams Dutch process cocoa powder", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/3 cup/43 grams all purpose flour", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter softened", "2 tablespoons cream cheese, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons cr\u00e8me de menthe", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon peppermint extract", "Pinch kosher salt", "2 cups/247 confectioner\u2019s sugar", "6 ounces/170 grams bittersweet chocolate", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy cream", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Pinch kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and line the bottom and sides of an 8-by-8-inch baking dish with parchment paper or aluminum foil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the brownies: In a heat-safe bowl set over a pan of simmering water, melt the 8 ounces/227 grams bittersweet chocolate and 1/2 cup/113 grams butter, stirring occasionally until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a separate large bowl, whisk the eggs and brown sugar together, until the mixture lightens a bit in color and texture, about 1 minute.
