{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Honey Cake\u00a0", "description": "This Hungarian honey cake is deeply flavored with ginger, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. The dough is more like a gingerbread biscuit than a tender sponge cake; it softens as it sits. It\u2019s best made at least a day in advance, resting until the icebox-like crust absorbs its sweet surrounding layers of filling. The buttery, vanilla-scented filling is so pleasant to the tongue \u2014 but so rich you may want to cut small cake slices. Hungarian honey cake was popular before the Holocaust, but sadly this version was largely lost with the cooks in concentration camps. It\u2019s been adapted in the United States by survivors and other family members using Cream of Wheat filling, which resembles the European gruel made with semolina or hard wheat flour, and enriched with lots of butter. This special cake brings back the memory of their former lives.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/14/dining/14cakerex/merlin_212255847_32432825-d209-4d22-b677-70225761eaaa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT5H30M", "recipeYield": "1 (9-inch) cake\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "cardamom, ground cinnamon, ground coriander, ground ginger, honey, layer cake, plan-ahead, rosh hashana", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 422}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/960 milliliters milk or soy milk\u00a0", "1 cup/176 grams Original 2 1/2-Minute Cream of Wheat", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams unsalted butter, cut into chunks\u00a0\u00a0", "1 1/4 cups/252 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine salt", "1 1/2 cups/454 grams thick, chunky apricot or sour cherry preserves", "1 cup/201 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters milk or soy milk", "3 tablespoons dark wildflower honey", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 large eggs\u00a0", "4 1/4 cups/544 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger\u00a0", "3/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "3/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/4 teaspoon fine salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the filling: In a medium pan over medium heat, bring the milk to a simmer, then whisk in the Cream of Wheat.
