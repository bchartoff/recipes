But it\u2019s an unlikely pairing, is peanut butter and pickle, and sometimes that is what a recipe is for -- to prod you in a direction that you never considered. Dwight Garner, a book critic for The Times, makes a strong case for this, his favorite sandwich, calling it \u201ca thrifty and unacknowledged American classic.\u201d The vinegary snap of the pickles tempers the unctuousness of the peanut butter, and it\u2019s an unusual pantry sandwich for when luncheon meats leave you cold.
