{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Chile Cheeseburger Deluxe", "description": "In New Mexico, where many traditional dishes contain roasted green chiles, it\u2019s only natural that hamburgers get the chile treatment, too. If you don\u2019t have access to fresh New Mexican green chiles, try fresh Anaheim chiles. Lacking those, use roasted\u00a0jalape\u00f1os that have been\u00a0peeled and chopped; thinly sliced raw jalape\u00f1os; or pickled jalape\u00f1os\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a compromise perhaps, but better than no chiles at all. As for cheese, any good melting kind of \u201cqueso amarillo\u201d will do, but domestic Monterey Jack or Muenster may be even better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/04/dining/04kitchrex/merlin_139481964_1cfcf988-0437-42b1-abf1-30a8a0102cb6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers", "keywords": "avocado, green chile, ground beef, monterey jack cheese, serrano chile, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 75}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 708, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "58 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "1060 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium white onion, diced small, soaked in ice water 10 minutes and drained", "2 medium firm-ripe tomatoes or 6 plum tomatoes, diced", "Salt, to taste", "1 Serrano chile, finely chopped", "Handful of chopped cilantro", "4 to 6 fresh New Mexico green or Anaheim chiles", "24 ounces ground beef or ground buffalo meat", "Salt and pepper", "8 slices Monterey Jack or Muenster", "4 hamburger buns, lightly toasted", "1 or 2 avocados, in thick slices"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the salsa: In a medium bowl, mix together onion, tomato, salt, Serrano chile and cilantro.
