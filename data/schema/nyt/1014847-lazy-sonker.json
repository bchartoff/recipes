They are deeper than cobblers. They used to be made in what Southern country cooks called bread pans.\u201d\u00a0This recipe, adapted from Wilma Fleming of Barney's Cafe, draws its flavor from strawberries, or pitted cherries, and is capped with a simple crust of milk, sugar, flour and salt, whisked to the consistency of pancake batter.
