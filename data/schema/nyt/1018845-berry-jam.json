{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Berry Jam", "description": "Jam made from peak-season berries is a far cry from anything you can buy at the grocery store. As the berries cook, the water in them evaporates, their sugars thicken and their flavors concentrate. What's left is the fruit's essence, which is why it's worth seeking out the best berries you can. This recipe works for several berry varieties, but note that some types are naturally more acidic than others, so adjust the fresh lemon or lime juice accordingly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/07/dining/07JAMGUIDE5/07JAMGUIDE5-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 cups (4 to 6 8-ounce jars)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 47}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds/1.8 kilograms whole blueberries or raspberries; blackberries, halved lengthwise; or 4 1/2 pounds/2 kilograms strawberries, hulled and quartered (see note)", "3 cups/600 grams granulated sugar", "3 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice (from about 2 lemons or limes)", "Add-ins (optional, see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss berries and sugar together in a large, heavy-bottomed pot.

Drag your finger through it: It should hold its shape on either side without appearing watery or runny. If it\u2019s not there yet, cook a few minutes more.
