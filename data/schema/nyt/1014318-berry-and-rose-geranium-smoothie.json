{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Berry and Rose Geranium Smoothie", "description": "When I go to a farmers\u2019 market in summer, I can\u2019t resist buying more fruit than I need. I blame those cut fruit samples \u2014 one taste, and I\u2019m filling my bag. Fruit from the market is already ripe, and there are times when I need to use up what I have. Smoothies are a great solution; you can blend a lot of fruit into one drink, more than you\u2019d cut up and stir into your morning yogurt.This week I tried something different. I didn\u2019t use frozen bananas in these recipes, as I usually do for smoothies, and I decided not to use dairy. Some of this week\u2019s offerings are pure fruit and ice, sweetened with a rose geranium-infused syrup or agave nectar. When I needed to bulk up a smoothie or make it creamier, I used almond milk. Except for one made with dates and figs, you\u2019ll find these smoothies only moderately sweet. In all of them, you can really taste the fruit. Fragrant rose geranium is very easy to grow in pots, and a little goes a long way. I use it to make a syrup that I add to just about anything I make with berries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/berrysmoothie/berrysmoothie-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "One serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "shakes and smoothies", "keywords": "healthy, raw, vegan, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup blueberries", "1/2 cup raspberries", "3/4 cup hulled strawberries", "2 to 3 tablespoons rose geranium syrup (see below)", "4 ice cubes", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/2 cup water", "2 sprigs rose geranium"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in the blender.
