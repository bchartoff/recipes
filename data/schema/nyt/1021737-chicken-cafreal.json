This dish is widely believed to have its origins in Mozambique and was brought by the Portuguese to their former colony of Goa in India. The signature hallmark of this dish is the fragrant concoction of spices and fresh herbs that\u2019s used as the marinade and then cooked to form\u00a0a very thick \u201cdry\u201d sauce, in which most of the water is driven out through evaporation to form a thick, flavorful coat on the chicken.\u00a0Typically, the potatoes are fried, but boiling them in water and then roasting them in the oven produces a creamier interior and crispy exterior.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/23/dining/18Cafrealrex/merlin_181228716_b30fe3f4-2779-479e-89ca-be16ce3d31e4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, chiles de \u00e1rbol, cilantro, cloves, ginger, potato, christmas, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 514}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, skin removed, or 3 pounds boneless, skinless thighs", "2 medium white or yellow onions, peeled", "1 bunch fresh cilantro", "1 whole head of garlic (about 12 cloves), peeled and roughly chopped", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 green chile, such as serrano, stemmed and roughly chopped", "10 whole cloves", "1 tablespoon fresh lime or lemon juice", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon whole black\u00a0peppercorns", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (or 1/2-inch cinnamon stick)", "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 medium russet potatoes", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prick the chicken all over with a fork and place in a resealable plastic bag or large bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut 1 onion into quarters and transfer to a blender.
