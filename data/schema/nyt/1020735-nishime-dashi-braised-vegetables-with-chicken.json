{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nishime (Dashi-Braised Vegetables With Chicken)", "description": "Often cooked for the New Year in Japan, nishime is an elegant kind of nimono, a Japanese term that literally means things \u2014 vegetables, fish or meat \u2014 simmered in seasoned dashi. Dashi can be any broth, but here it\u2019s flavored simply with kombu (kelp). This version is from the chef Sydne Gooden, who has brightened the color of her great-grandmother\u2019s nimono recipe by adding kabocha and purple sweet potato to what is usually a very brown dish. While she skips cutting the carrots and lotus roots into fussy flower shapes, she insists on cooking each vegetable consecutively in the same dashi (rather than throwing them all in together, like everyday nimono), so that each one keeps its distinct shape and color. By the end, the dashi has concentrated and taken on the flavors of all the ingredients. It\u2019s spooned over chicken thighs and the perfectly cooked vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hannah Kirshner"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/25/dining/25OSECHIREX3/merlin_166106808_dbc51925-dd6d-43dc-86cd-2842825a2ff9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, vegetables", "keywords": "bamboo shoots, chicken thigh, daikon, kabocha, purple potato, shiitake, taro root, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 47}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (5-inch-long) pieces kombu (about 1 ounce) (see Note)", "Fine sea salt", "2 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 pound), deboned", "1 medium daikon (about 1 pound)", "6 to 8 small satoimo (Japanese taro) (about 1 pound)", "1/2 teaspoon white vinegar", "1/2 pound lotus root", "1 large carrot", "1/2 kabocha squash (about 1 pound), seeded", "10 fresh shiitake mushrooms (about 6 ounces)", "1 fresh or canned bamboo shoot (about 1 pound)", "1/2 pound purple sweet potato", "1/4 cup usukuchi shoyu (see Note)", "2 tablespoons mirin", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, soak kombu in 4 cups water until the water is flavorful, at least 2 hours (or overnight)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a plate, salt the chicken generously on both sides; set aside in the refrigerator."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the vegetables, and keep each in its own separate container: Peel daikon and cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.
