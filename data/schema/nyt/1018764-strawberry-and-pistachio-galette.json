{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry and Pistachio Galette", "description": "With a double filling of homemade strawberry compote sitting on top of a layer pistachio frangipane, this elegant galette is a perfect way to showcase ripe summer berries. It is a bit more demanding to make than many other galettes, but you can do it in stages, making the dough, the compote and the frangipane a few days ahead, then bake on the same day as you plan to serve it so the pastry stays delightfully crisp. And if you miss strawberry season, make this with raspberries, blackberries or blueberries, adjusting the sugar in the compote to match the sweetness of the fruit (taste and add more sugar for sour fruit, less sugar for sweeter fruit).\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/25/dining/24APPE1/24APPE1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "brandy, cream cheese, pistachio, strawberries, dessert, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 459}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 448, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "214 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups/280 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 cup/226 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), very cold, cut in 1-inch pieces", "4 ounces/113 grams cream cheese, very cold, cut in 1-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon lemon juice", "3 to 4 tablespoons/45 to 60 milliliters ice water", "1 pound/454 grams strawberries, hulled and halved", "1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plus 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "1/2 cup/100 grams plus 1 to 2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "3/4 cup/100 grams shelled raw pistachios, plus 2 tablespoons chopped raw pistachios", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), softened", "3 large eggs", "1 tablespoon brandy", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional)", "Turbinado or Demerara sugar, as needed", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a food processor, pulse to combine flour, salt and sugar.
