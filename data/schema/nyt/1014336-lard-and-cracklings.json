The lard will clarify, and the cracklings will shrivel and shrink. As it cooks, watch and listen: turn down the heat or take the pan off the heat if it smokes or if the lard starts to brown."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When the cracklings are lightly golden and have almost stopped bubbling, remove them and drain on paper towels or a brown paper bag. Strain the lard through a cheesecloth into a jar or bowl, where it will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for several weeks. Try a crackling. If it is not crunchy and appetizing, crisp the rest on a baking sheet in a 375-degree oven for 15-20 minutes. Season if you\u2019d like, then cool on paper towels. Cracklings, well drained and lightly covered, will keep at room temperature for at least a week."}]}
