{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sazerac", "description": "Paul Gustings, the bartender at Broussard's in New Orleans, is nothing if not exacting when it comes to his Sazerac. \u201cIt has to be Old Overholt,\u201d he said of his choice of rye. And not the standard two ounces, but an ounce and three-quarters. The glass must be rinsed with the anise-flavored liqueur Herbsaint, not absinthe. And, he said, \u201cI use much more Peychaud\u2019s that others do: 11 dashes.\u201d That\u2019s only, however, if you\u2019re halfway through the bottle of bitters. If you\u2019ve just opened it, it\u2019s 13, according to Mr. Gustings, who says the dashes are smaller at that point; if you\u2019re near the end, make it 10 dashes. The extra dose of bitters gives the drink a rosier glow than most Sazeracs, and a very dry finish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/04/dining/sazerac-still/sazerac-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "bitters, lemon twist, rye, simple syrup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 36}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 ounces Old Overholt rye", "1/8 ounce simple syrup (see note)", "11 dashes Peychaud\u2019s bitters", "3 dashes Herbsaint liqueur", "Lemon twist"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chill a rocks glass.
