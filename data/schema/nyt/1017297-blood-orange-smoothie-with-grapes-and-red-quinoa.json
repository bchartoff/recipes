{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blood Orange Smoothie With Grapes and Red Quinoa", "description": "I had never considered using red grapes in a smoothie until I began working on pairing fruit with grains in this week\u2019s Recipes for Health. Red grapes and red quinoa are a perfect match. I used blood orange juice as the liquid and sweetened it with a bit of pomegranate molasses. As the mixture was whirling in the blender it occurred to me that a small handful of kale would be welcome; it would darken the color slightly and contribute all that kale has to offer without distorting the sweet/tannic flavor of the drink. The second time I made the smoothie I froze the grapes, which is a great idea. Then you won\u2019t have to dilute the flavors with ice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/17/science/recipehealthbloodorange/recipehealthbloodorange-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 to 2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 210, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "8 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup cooked red quinoa", "1 cup red seedless grapes, preferably frozen (6 ounces)", "1 cup blood orange juice (or regular orange juice if blood oranges are not available)", "1 teaspoon pomegranate molasses", "2 tablespoons soaked cashews", "Small handful of kale"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in the jar of a blender and blend at high speed until smooth.
