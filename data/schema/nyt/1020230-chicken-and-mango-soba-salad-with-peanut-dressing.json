{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Mango Soba Salad With Peanut Dressing", "description": "Japanese buckwheat noodles are usually served cold or in a hot soup, but here, they\u2019re given a bright jolt of color and texture. Delightfully chewy soba noodles are combined with chicken, mango, snap peas, cucumber and a spicy peanut dressing for a great warm-weather lunch that\u2019s also picnic-friendly. Serve it alongside any grilled meat or fish, or leave the chicken out to make it vegetarian. To make this ahead, prepare all the salad components in advance, but wait until serving time to combine to keep flavors and textures vibrant.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/dining/ss-soba-salad/ss-soba-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, noodles, poultry, vegetables", "keywords": "chicken, cilantro, ginger, mango, peanut butter, snap peas, soba noodles, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 210}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup smooth peanut butter, natural or regular", "1/4 cup hot water", "3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon lime juice (from 1 lime)", "1/2 teaspoon Sriracha or other hot sauce", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar (optional)", "10 ounces\u00a0sugar snap peas (about 2 cups)", "8 ounces soba noodles", "2 cups shredded cooked chicken", "1 small or 1/2 large mango, peeled and thinly sliced", "2 mini cucumbers, thinly sliced (or 1/2 English cucumber)", "1 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves", "2 Fresno chiles, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.\u00a0In a medium bowl, whisk peanut butter, hot water, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, lime juice and Sriracha until smooth.
