{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Adasi", "description": "A Persian dish of simply cooked lentils, adasi is often eaten as a warming breakfast in Iran, but it can make a comforting lunch or dinner, too. There are many variations, but the core ingredients are the same: lentils, salt and water. This recipe also calls for onion, cumin and turmeric, then simmering until the lentils become soft and creamy. (Don\u2019t be deterred by the long cooking time, as the majority of it is hands off. To help reduce the cooking time, soak the lentils before cooking for two hours or up to overnight.) Garnishes are customizable: Add a pinch of dried oregano or fresh cilantro or parsley, then top with a pat of butter and enjoy as-is, or with a side of hard-boiled eggs or roast vegetables. It\u2019s a wonderful dish to have in the fridge for a quick, nourishing meal any time of day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/19/dining/yf-adasi/yf-adasi-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, beans, soups and stews, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cumin, lentils, salt, turmeric, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 389}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 medium yellow onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "Kosher salt", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 pound green lentils (about 2 heaping cups), rinsed", "1 lime or lemon, cut into wedges", "Dried oregano, fresh cilantro or parsley (optional), for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium until shimmering.
