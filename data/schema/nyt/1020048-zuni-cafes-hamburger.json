First, grass-fed beef is salted well in advance of grinding, which gives the meat its succulence. Grilled over coals and flipped three times to prevent it from overcharring or becoming tough, the patty is rested, like a roast. It is then served on a toasted square of rosemary focaccia, smeared with handmade aioli and accompanied by Zuni\u2019s acclaimed house pickles: fuchsia-red onion rings and turmeric-tinged sliced zucchini. With all the attention to detail, you\u2019ll see why a Zuni burger sells for $18. It is wonderful on its own, but toppings like Shelburne Farms Cheddar, Bayley Hazen blue cheese, grilled onions or portobello mushroom are also available, and most customers can\u2019t resist a heaping plate of shoestring potatoes alongside. It\u2019s perfectly possible to make these burgers at home, but know that the full project involves several recipes, so it\u2019s probably best to spread the work out over a few days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/06/dining/06kitchrex4-1-copy/merlin_150550896_37ba3d6a-edde-4060-9285-6865be03e3b3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers", "keywords": "beef chuck, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 81}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless beef chuck, well marbled", "1 generous teaspoon kosher salt", "Focaccia (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020050-zuni-cafes-focaccia\">see recipe</a>)", "Small-batch aioli (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020051-zuni-cafes-small-batch-aioli\">see recipe</a>)", "Red oak leaf\u00a0or other lettuce\u00a0leaves, for\u00a0garnish", "Zucchini pickles (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020052-zuni-cafes-zucchini-pickles\">see recipe</a>)", "Red onion pickles (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020053-red-onion-pickles\">see recipe</a>)\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut meat into 1-inch chunks or strips.
