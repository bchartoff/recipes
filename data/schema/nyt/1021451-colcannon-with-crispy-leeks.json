{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Colcannon With Crispy Leeks", "description": "An Irish dish of mashed potatoes and greens, colcannon is one of the most nourishing, comforting dishes you could make. The fried leeks aren\u2019t traditional: Usually, the alliums are stewed more slowly in butter, if they\u2019re used at all. But they lend a deeper flavor, and a crisp, savory finish. For a full meal, crown it with a fried egg or some smoked salmon, or serve a simple green salad on the side.
