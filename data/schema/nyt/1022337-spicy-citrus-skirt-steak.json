{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Citrus Skirt Steak", "description": "You don\u2019t need a meat thermometer to grill a great skirt steak: When cooked over high heat, the inside will be medium rare once the steak is bronzed on the outside. For seasoning, counter the cut\u2019s big buttery flavor with something salty, spicy or fresh. In this recipe, the grilled steak rests in a tart sauce of tangerine, soy sauce, ginger and vinegar that is reminiscent of ponzu, with hints of citrusy bitterness similar to the dried tangerine peel used in Sichuan and Hunan cooking. Here, that bittersweet edge comes from charring the fruit and peel. Serve with rice or a grilled green vegetable like Chinese broccoli or asparagus.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/24/dining/28grillingrex4/merlin_189645735_fb6d94a3-9dda-4438-9ce2-9763c68b41c7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "ginger, oranges, soy sauce, steak", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 854}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds skirt steak (see Tips)", "8 tangerines, satsumas or mandarin oranges, washed and halved horizontally", "6 tablespoons unseasoned rice wine vinegar", "6 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "1 tablespoon sambal oelek or Sriracha, plus more as needed", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely grated (about 1 tablespoon)", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Neutral oil, such as grapeseed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for two-zone cooking over high heat: For a charcoal grill, pour the coals onto one half of the grill.
