It\u2019s an intense, rich side dish for roast chicken, pork or a full-flavored fish like salmon or mackerel. If it\u2019s not corn season, substitute frozen corn and shave a minute or two off the cooking time. In either case this dish comes together in a flash.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/08/dining/08shishito/08shishito-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "corn, Japanese curry paste, shishito, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 90}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "342 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as sunflower or grapeseed", "4 ounces/2 packed cups whole shishito peppers", "4 cups fresh corn kernels (from 4 to 5 large ears corn)", "3 tablespoons Japanese curry paste (also called curry sauce mix)", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large saut\u00e9 pan over high heat and add oil; let heat for 30 seconds.
