{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peppermint Stick Ice Cream", "description": "Making any ice cream at home is simple once you master one very important step: knowing when to stop cooking the custard. It should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Test it by drawing a line with your finger. The edge of that line should stay straight for a few seconds without dripping. If you are at all nervous, keep an ice bath near the stove. That way you can plunge the pot into the water and stop the cooking quickly if it comes close to curdling. The recipe includes an optional bittersweet chocolate swirl that adds a sophisticated edge to this refreshing ice cream, but purists can feel free to leave it out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/22/dining/22COOKING-PEPPERMINT-ICECREAM/22COOKING-PEPPERMINT-ICECREAM-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 quarts\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "candy canes, peppermint, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 40}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 318, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "59 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 large egg yolks", "1 cup sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 cups heavy cream", "1 cup whole milk", "1 1/2 teaspoons peppermint extract", "1/2 cup finely crushed candy canes", "5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted", "4 teaspoons vegetable oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and salt until pale yellow.
