{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beer-Can Chicken", "description": "The moist environment created by smoke-roasting a chicken vertically, atop a half-full can of beer, turns out to be a nearly fail-safe way to achieve barbecue perfection. A smoky-sweet dry rub adds complexity. The dish can also be made in an oven, in a roasting pan. (You can even buy stainless-steel vertical roasting stands for this very purpose.) What follows is a recipe for a traditional, spice-rubbed version of the dish. But once you have dialed in your technique, feel free to experiment. Coating the chicken with a paste of miso, mirin and soy, then replacing the beer in the can with sake, is one way to start.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/15/dining/15COOKING-BEERCAN-CHICKEN3/15COOKING-BEERCAN-CHICKEN3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beer, chicken, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 529}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 403, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "530 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole chicken, approximately 4 to 5 pounds", "4 tablespoons sweet paprika, or mild smoked paprika", "2 tablespoons chili powder", "2 tablespoons ground cumin", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1 tablespoon brown sugar", "1 tablespoon granulated white sugar", "1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon chile de arbol or red-pepper flakes, or to taste", "1 can beer, ideally yellow in hue, with the top half consumed or poured off", "Barbecue sauce (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014854/White-Barbecue-Sauce.html\">see recipe</a>, or use whichever recipe you like), for basting chicken and for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a fire in your grill, leaving approximately half the grilling area free\nof coals.
