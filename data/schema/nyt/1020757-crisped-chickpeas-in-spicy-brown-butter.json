{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crisped Chickpeas in Spicy Brown Butter", "description": "This recipe for crisped chickpeas dressed in spicy brown butter is your new, 15-minute way to turn a simple can of chickpeas into a satisfying dinner. Chickpeas are fried in a little olive oil, then butter is added, which turns browns and nutty. Crushed fennel seeds and red-pepper flakes season the brown butter, but feel free play around: Add a sprig of thyme or rosemary, a few tablespoons of olives or capers, some grated garlic and ginger, or a drizzle of tahini or honey. You can also toast some nuts or seeds, like cashews or sesame, in the browning butter. Just before serving, add a little lemon juice or vinegar to offset the richness. Serve over yogurt, orzo or rice, or top with a fried egg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/09/dining/as-crisp-chickpeas/merlin_166828386_1347ec3c-f490-4b7b-89e5-30de199cb17b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, beans", "keywords": "butter, chickpea, fennel seeds, lemon juice, olive oil, red-pepper flakes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 202}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 (14-ounce) cans chickpeas", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "1 teaspoon crushed fennel seeds", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "Greek yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat the olive oil over medium.
