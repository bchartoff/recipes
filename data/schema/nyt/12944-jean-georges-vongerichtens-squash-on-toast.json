You\u2019ll roast a cut squash and confit onion slices with maple syrup and apple cider vinegar. Veteran cooks will immediately get the idea: Cook the onions awhile, until they\u2019re dark and soft, then add the two liquids and continue to cook until they\u2019re jammy. The process could take as long as an hour, depending on the heat, your attentiveness and the water content of the onions. But it isn\u2019t difficult. Do not forget the mint; it\u2019s not the same without it.
