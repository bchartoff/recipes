Most commonly finished with dill, tzatziki is sometimes made \u2014 and equally delicious \u2014 with other fresh herbs, like mint or oregano. It can be made a few hours ahead and will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/26/dining/kc-tzatziki/merlin_210788775_ab94fb3f-71f7-4713-9813-88d39b5d19d9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2\u00bd cups", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "cucumber, dill, greek yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 507}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 Persian cucumbers", "2 cups plain whole-milk Greek yogurt", "2 tablespoons finely chopped dill", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 garlic clove, minced", "Salt and pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using the large holes of a box grater, grate cucumbers.
