{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Apples", "description": "I don\u2019t remember my mother at the stove.  When asked what childhood dish was my favorite, I\u2019d stammer and come up empty.  And then, walking down the stairs in my Paris apartment, I got to the third floor and said out loud to no one: baked apples! My mother made baked apples. Her apples were big Cortlands or Rome Beauties, and she cored and stuffed them with raisins, because my father loved raisins. I also bake with Cortlands or Romes when I can get them, Fujis or Galas when I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll often stuff them with raisins, but I think they\u2019re especially nice filled with bits of dried apple and candied ginger. And I like to baste them with apple cider and honey. They\u2019re good hot or cold, but best served warm and topped with something creamy. Cinnamon (my mom always used too much) is optional.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/21/magazine/22mag-eat/22mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apple, apple cider, apple juice, cinnamon, crystalized ginger, honey, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 396}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large baking apples, like Rome Beauty", "2 lemon wedges", "2 to 3 dried apple rings, cut into bits", "4 tiny pieces crystallized ginger (optional)", "3 to 4 teaspoons honey", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 cup/240 milliliters apple cider or juice", "Heavy cream, whipped cream or ice cream, for serving (optional)", "Cinnamon, for dusting (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven and heat to 375.
