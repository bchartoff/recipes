It\u2019s fast, flavorful and comforting, especially when served with mashed potatoes to drink up the pan juices. You can substitute any other mild-fleshed fish for the cod. Hake, sea bass, flounder and porgy all work nicely, though you may have to adjust the cooking time, depending on the thickness of the fillets.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/10/dining/10APPE2/merlin_131766866_5a12267d-a773-4dd3-8737-590b05f536af-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, seafood", "keywords": "cod, garlic, shallot, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 717}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 287, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "654 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cod or hake fillets (6 to 8 ounces each)", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1 large shallot or 1/4 of a red onion, thinly sliced", "5 sprigs thyme", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "1/3 cup plain yogurt (see Note)", "2 tablespoons minced fresh dill, parsley or cilantro, more for serving", "1 small clove garlic, finely grated or minced", "Flaky sea salt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season fish with salt and pepper and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet with a lid, melt butter in olive oil over medium heat.
