Here, it\u2019s a chile oil made with both dried and fresh chiles, so it\u2019s devilishly spiced \u2014 not just spicy. Simmer the lentils in the potent oil and some tomato paste until they\u2019re glossy and tender, rich and spicy as you\u2019d expect from a diavolo-style sauce. (Add more water if you\u2019re after more of a quasi-chili.) Eat the lentils with a spray of lemon juice, parsley and-or bread crumbs on toast, grains, pasta, a sweet potato, bitter greens or all on their own. The lentils will keep for up to 4 days in the fridge; reheat over low heat or in the microwave loosened with a little water.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/30/dining/30as-lentils-diavolo/as-lentils-diavolo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, beans, vegetables", "keywords": "brown lentils, green lentils, jalape\u00f1o, tomato paste, main course, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 813}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 401, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "262 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 jalape\u00f1o, halved, seeded if desired, and finely chopped", "6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/4 cup tomato paste", "1 1/2 cups brown or green lentils", "1 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a medium saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat.
