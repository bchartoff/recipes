{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Labneh Dip With Sizzled Scallions and Chile", "description": "In this very high-brow version of ranch dressing, adapted from \"Nothing Fancy\" by Alison Roman (Clarkson Potter, 2019), scalliony chile oil gets sizzled with cilantro stems (or chives) and swirled into thick, lemony labneh. If you can find green garlic, which tends to be hyperseasonal, use that or even ramps in place of the scallions. Serve with raw vegetables for dipping, as a spread with crackers or flatbread, or alongside roasted lamb or vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/dining/07romanrex1/07romanrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, labneh, scallion, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 619}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup olive oil", "4 scallions (or green garlic), white and light green parts, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems) or chives, plus more for garnish", "Flaky sea salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 cups labneh, full-fat Greek yogurt or sour cream", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil, scallions, red-pepper flakes and cilantro in a small pot over medium-low heat.
