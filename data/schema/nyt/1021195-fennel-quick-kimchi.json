{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fennel \u2018Quick Kimchi\u2019", "description": "This is not a traditional kimchi, but it approximates the flavor profile, bypassing a lengthier fermentation and instead relying on vinegar. In Korea, this dish would be considered a muchim, which can refer to any number of \u201cseasoned\u201d or \u201cdressed\u201d salads or other preparations. That also means you can eat it right away, though this fennel kimchi will keep up to two or three days before losing its crunch. Admittedly, fennel is not a traditional ingredient in kimchi, but its gentle aniseed flavor provides a clean landing pad for the spicy dressing, which leans on pantry stalwarts like gochugaru, sesame oil and fish sauce. Enjoy this as a hearty salad alongside fish, pork chops or any main dish that could use a fresh accompaniment. For a vegetarian option, you can swap out the fish sauce for soy sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/08/dining/02kimchirex2/02kimchirex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 2 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, snack, weeknight, pickles, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "fennel, fish sauce, garlic, gochugaru, sesame oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 184}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound trimmed fennel bulbs (about 2 or 3), halved, then thinly sliced (about 1/8-inch thick) from root to stem", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated garlic", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sesame oil", "1 tablespoon gochugaru", "2 teaspoons fish sauce", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Thinly sliced scallions, chopped chives, or cilantro or flat-leaf parsley leaves, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, toss the fennel with the salt, transfer to a colander, and let sit in the sink to drain, about 30 minutes.
