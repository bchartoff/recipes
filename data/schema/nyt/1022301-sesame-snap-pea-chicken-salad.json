{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame Snap Pea-Chicken Salad", "description": "This simple salad features crisp-tender sugar snap peas, delicate shredded chicken and creamy sesame dressing. The cooking methods are important here: Blanching the peas, then shocking them in ice water ensures that they retain crunch and color, while gently poaching the boneless chicken breast and plunging it into an ice water bath means it stays moist. The tangy dressing, which is a nod to the highly addictive Japanese-style goma dressing, is\u00a0made with earthy roasted sesame seeds and mayonnaise; it finds its way to the craggy edges of the shredded chicken. Try to shred the meat the same size as the sliced peas for the best texture. This salad is great to serve immediately, and even better after spending at least an hour in the refrigerator.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hana Asbrink"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/09/dining/ha-snap-pea-and-chicken-salad/merlin_188895543_3f383693-6ea0-47dc-90fe-fbf4bbbb40b2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings (about 4 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry, salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, mayonnaise, sesame seeds, sugar snap peas, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 879}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 8 to 10 ounces)", "Kosher salt", "3/4 to 1 pound sugar snap peas", "1/4 cup roasted white sesame seeds", "1/4 cup mayonnaise (preferably Kewpie brand)", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, add the chicken and enough cold water to cover it by 1 inch.
