{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Pizza With Asparagus and Arugula", "description": "You might be tempted to call this a focaccia, not pizza, and you might be right, but it probably falls somewhere in between. Store-bought pizza dough can be a real time-saver, but if you can\u2019t find it refrigerated, you\u2019ll need to plan ahead to defrost frozen dough. Defrosting is best done for 24 hours or so in the fridge \u2014 or longer, as the dough will continue to ferment and improve in flavor after a day or two. The dough is easier to stretch if it\u2019s not ice cold, so let it come to room temperature. The pancetta can be omitted for vegetarians, but the lemony herb and arugula salad on top is not to be missed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/dining/ss-sheet-pan-pizza/ss-sheet-pan-pizza-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "arugula, asparagus, mozzarella, parsley, pizza dough, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 281}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons olive oil", "1 pound fresh or thawed frozen pizza dough, at room temperature", "1/2 cup fresh ricotta (about 4 ounces)", "5 ounces fresh mozzarella, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rounds", "1/2 bunch asparagus (about 1/2 pound), trimmed and cut into 5-inch pieces", "1 or 2 serrano or jalape\u00f1o peppers, thinly sliced", "4 thin slices pancetta (optional)", "1/2 cup pitted and torn green olives, like\u00a0Castelvetrano", "Flaky sea salt and black pepper", "1 cup loosely packed Italian parsley", "1 cup loosely packed baby arugula", "2 teaspoons lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 500 degrees.
