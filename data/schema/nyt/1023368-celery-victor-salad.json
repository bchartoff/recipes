But the chef Tirzah Stashko\u2019s exacting recipe can produce restaurant-worthy results at home if you set aside time to tackle its parts in advance. Inspired by the classic dish created by Victor Hirtzler, the chef at San Francisco\u2019s Hotel St. Francis from 1904 to 1926, Ms. Stashko\u2019s dish is more audacious: While Mr. Hirtzler braised celery until sweet, subtle and succulent, Ms. Stashko bolsters the softened stalks with bitter greens and piquant mustard seeds, then slicks them with mashed anchovies, capers and garlic. There is nothing subtle about it, but the complexity of each bite will validate your efforts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/27/dining/aw-celery-victor/aw-celery-victor-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project, salads and dressings, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, celery, mustard seed, scallion, spigarello", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 324}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 large carrots, peeled, roughly chopped, then pulsed in a food processor until minced", "1 1/2 quarts/48 ounces vegetable stock", "1 lemon, quartered", "12 large fresh thyme sprigs", "2 garlic cloves, smashed\u00a0", "1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns", "2 dried bay leaves", "4 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 head of celery, fresh green leaves reserved; stalks separated, trimmed and halved crosswise", "12 scallions, trimmed and halved crosswise, whites and greens separated", "1/2 cup white wine vinegar", "2 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard seeds", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons finely minced shallot", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)\u00a0", "6 medium jarred anchovies in oil", "1 tablespoon brined capers", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil", "6 cups spigarello (or baby kale, or trimmed Tuscan kale), torn into bite-size pieces", "1 cup shaved Parmesan (about 4 ounces), plus more to taste", "1 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves", "4 teaspoon sherry vinegar mixed with 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the stock for the braised celery and scallions: In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-low.
