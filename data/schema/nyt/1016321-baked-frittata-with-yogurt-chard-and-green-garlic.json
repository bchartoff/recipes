{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Frittata With Yogurt, Chard and Green Garlic", "description": "Inspired by the signature Proven\u00e7al chard omelet called truccha, this beautiful baked frittata incorporates thick Greek yogurt and lots of green garlic. It will puff up in the oven, but then it settles back down. Use a generous bunch of chard for this \u2013 green, red or rainbow \u2013 and save the stalks to use in the chard stalk and chickpea pur\u00e9e that I\u2019m also posting this week. I like to serve the frittata at room temperature, or I grab a cold slice for lunch. It\u2019s a wonderfully portable dish. \n\n<i>The filling can be prepared through Step 4 up to 3 days ahead. The frittata keeps well for 2 or 3 days in the refrigerator.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/03/science/06recipehealth/06recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "gluten-free, halal, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 83}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 157, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "382 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 generous bunch Swiss chard (1 to 1 1/4 pounds with stems), either green, rainbow or red", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 bulb green garlic, papery shells removed, chopped", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary", "6 eggs", "2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt or drained yogurt (2 percent or whole milk)", "Freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
