{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Tagliatelle With Chickpeas and Smoky Tomatoes", "description": "Two pantry staples, chickpeas and pasta, come together to give you this hearty vegan main. (Do check the ingredient list on the packaging for your tagliatelle, as some may contain egg.) Frying the pasta nests before cooking them provides plenty of texture, even as the pasta softens and releases its starches into the chickpeas and their cooking water. Feel free to play around with the smoky tomato oil, adding different chiles or spices, such as cumin or coriander seeds. And be sure to start the night before by soaking your chickpeas. However, if you\u2019re running low on time, you can also use two drained 14-ounce cans of chickpeas, adjusting liquid levels as necessary.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/20/dining/15Ottorex/merlin_182197905_4db9d7d3-8862-462c-8bd0-234f46ffde90-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, pastas, main course", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, chickpea, chipotle, olive oil, tagliatelle, tomato, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1703}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces/250 grams datterini or cherry tomatoes", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters olive oil", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 1/2 teaspoons chipotle chile flakes", "1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "8 dried tagliatelle nests", "1 cup/200 grams dried chickpeas, soaked 8 to 24 hours in plenty of cold water with 1/2 teaspoon baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 lemons, 1 halved and the other cut into 4 wedges", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the smoky tomato oil: Place a medium saut\u00e9 pan over high heat.
