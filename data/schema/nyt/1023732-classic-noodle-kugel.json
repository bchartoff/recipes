{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Noodle Kugel", "description": "With its wide ribbons of egg noodles bound by cottage cheese, sour cream and eggs, this classic dairy kugel recipe celebrates the sweeter, richer side of noodle puddings. You can make it the day before, store it in the fridge, then reheat it in a 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes just before serving. But it\u2019s also great at room temperature. Blending the cottage cheese gives this version a smooth, almost cheesecakelike interior. For a more nubby texture with bits of cottage cheese peeking through the noodles, don\u2019t use a blender; just whisk everything together in a big bowl.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/14/multimedia/07apperex-kugel-1-607c/07apperex-kugel-1-607c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, main course", "keywords": "cottage cheese, dried apricots, egg noodle, light brown sugar, make-ahead, sour cream, hanukkah, rosh hashana", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 382}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon fine salt, plus more as needed", "10 tablespoons/142 grams unsalted butter, melted", "12 ounces/340 grams extra-wide egg noodles", "2/3 cup/106 grams raisins or diced dried apricots, dates, apples or prunes (optional)", "6 large eggs", "2 cups/454 grams cottage cheese", "2 cups/454 grams sour cream", "1/3 to 2/3 cup/66 grams to 132 grams light brown sugar, depending upon how sweet you like your kugel", "1/3 cup/79 milliliters whole milk", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, cardamom or ginger or a combination, or use grated lemon zest", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg or black pepper (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rimmed sheet pan in the oven and heat to 350 degrees.
