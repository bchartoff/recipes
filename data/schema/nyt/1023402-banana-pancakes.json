Fold it just until streaks of flour have disappeared but not enough to smooth out the lumps. As they sizzle in plenty of melted butter, they will puff up and develop crisp edges and fluffy, tender interiors. Keep the cooked pancakes warm on a rack in a 200-degree oven while cooking off the rest of the batter and they will all stay hot and ready for serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/08/dining/SSE-banana-pancakes/merlin_210764685_c0da18b2-e2db-473e-b71a-e694b34bba66-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, quick, pancakes, main course", "keywords": "banana, buttermilk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 955}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/256 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons (light or dark) brown sugar", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters buttermilk", "1 cup/230 grams mashed banana (from 2 to 3 very ripe bananas)", "2 large eggs", "3 tablespoons/43 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly, plus more as needed", "Maple syrup (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
