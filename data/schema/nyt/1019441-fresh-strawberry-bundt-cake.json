This summery Bundt packs a double dose of strawberry flavor, so use the very best ones you can find. (You'll need 1 pound of strawberries for the cake and glaze.) A couple of tips for Bundt unmolding success: Make sure to butter and flour the pan generously and evenly, and let the cake cool for 15 minutes on a cooling rack, then flip it out on to the rack to cool completely. Don\u2019t worry too much if your cake isn\u2019t perfect: The blanket of pink glaze will cover many mistakes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/24/dining/yossy-strawberry-bundt-horizontal/yossy-strawberry-bundt-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, lemon, strawberries, whole milk yogurt, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 709}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 460, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "327 milligrams", "sugarContent": "53 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened, plus more for greasing the pan", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 3/4 cups/350 grams granulated sugar", "Zest from 1 lemon (about 1 teaspoon)", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters whole-milk yogurt, not Greek", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 3/4 cups fresh strawberries (about 1 pound/410 grams), hulled and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/4 cup/40 grams strawberries", "2 cups/245 grams confectioners' sugar (unsifted)", "2 to 3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 325 degrees.
