{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sicilian Beef Ragout", "description": "This recipe was developed to accompany the dense, earthy wines of Sicily, specifically the ones made with the grape known as nero d\u2019Avola. It is a hearty beef ragout enriched with the wine, fresh herbs, olives, chiles and tomatoes, roasted to reduce the liquid and concentrate the flavor.

If you store the tomatoes in a microwave-safe container, they can be warmed with a 30-second zap.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/14/dining/14PAIRING/14PAIRING-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef chuck, green olives, plum tomato, red wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 513}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 354, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "830 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 plum tomatoes, quartered lengthwise", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and ground black pepper", "6 sprigs fresh thyme", "3 pounds beef chuck in 2-inch chunks", "1/2 cup finely chopped fennel bulb", "1/2 cup finely chopped leeks (white only)", "1 shallot, finely chopped", "4 cloves garlic, minced", "2 tablespoons flour", "12 large Sicilian green olives, pitted and chopped", "1 teaspoon crushed red chile flakes", "1 1/2 cups robust red wine", "1/2 cup beef stock", "3 branches fresh rosemary"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place tomatoes in a bowl, add 1 tablespoon of the oil, season with salt and pepper and toss.
