{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pan Orzo With Spinach and Feta", "description": "Similar to spanakorizo, a Greek spinach and rice dish, this easy, meatless meal features orzo, spinach, peas and scallions. It is deeply satisfying but still on the lighter side of pasta recipes, thanks to all those vegetables. A little feta gives it creaminess and tang, while some lemon zest brightens everything up. It makes a complete meal on its own, or, if you\u2019re looking for something more substantial, serve this as a hearty side dish to roasted meats or fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/24/dining/25apperex/merlin_177433971_bdf5bb41-0f74-45ae-8526-1d77b3ed18f4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, pastas, main course, side dish", "keywords": "feta, orzo, skillet, spinach, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 6507}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 large scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "8 ounces baby spinach leaves (8 cups), coarsely chopped", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock", "1 cup orzo", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (from 1 lemon)", "3/4 cup crumbled feta (3 ounces), plus more for garnish", "1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed (optional)", "1 cup chopped fresh dill, or use parsley or cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium, then melt butter, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
