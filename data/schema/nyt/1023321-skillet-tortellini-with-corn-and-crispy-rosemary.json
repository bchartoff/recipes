Fresh store-bought tortellini are a boon to quick meals, especially when they\u2019re cooked directly in the sauce instead of a big pot of water. But it\u2019s the trifecta of salty bacon, sweet corn and rosemary that makes this pasta substantial enough for cool nights yet fresh enough for summer \u2014 which is to say, it\u2019s great for any time at all. To incorporate a green vegetable, add one that can cook in three to five minutes along with the pasta, such as halved snap peas, thinly sliced asparagus or broccolini, or spinach, or eat the pasta alongside a light salad of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020223-via-carotas-insalata-verde\">greens</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012582-sugar-snap-pea-salad-with-radishes-mint-and-ricotta-salata\">crunchy vegetables</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/13/dining/as-skillet-tortelllini/as-skillet-tortelllini-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "bacon, corn, rosemary, tortellini, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 461}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 thick bacon slices, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces", "5 rosemary sprigs", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "16 to 20 ounces refrigerated cheese or cheese-and-spinach tortellini or tortelloni", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "Black pepper", "Kernels from 4 ears of corn, cobs scraped of their milk and reserved (or use 4 cups frozen and thawed kernels)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the bacon, 4 of the rosemary sprigs and 1 tablespoon butter in a large (at least 12-inch) nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet.
