{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chez Ma Tante\u2019s Pancakes", "description": "At the Brooklyn restaurant Chez Ma Tante, the brunch pancakes come two to an order, big as dessert plates and almost burnt. \u201cI knew I wanted them to be really, really crispy,\u201d said the chef de cuisine Jake Leiber. He was inspired by a fairly straightforward pancake recipe made with bacon fat he found in \u201cHow America Eats,\u201d the seminal cookbook by Clementine Paddleford, an American food historian. Mr. Leiber swaps the lard for butter, adds an extra egg yolk to his batter, cranks up the heat on his vintage cast-iron skillet, then pours in an outrageous amount of melted clarified butter. Fried in shallow pools of hot fat, each pancake gets fritter-like crisped edges. Mr. Leiber serves them with more butter, and glugs of maple syrup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/dining/dg-chez-ma-tante-pancakes/dg-chez-ma-tante-pancakes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 large pancakes", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, quick, pancakes", "keywords": "eggs, flour, ghee, maple syrup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 886}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large egg", "1 egg yolk", "2 1/2 tablespoons baking powder", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/4 cups whole milk", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018510-clarified-butter\">clarified butter</a> (or store-bought), melted", "Salted butter, for serving (optional)", "Maple syrup, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk egg and yolk together in a medium bowl.
