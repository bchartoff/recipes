Hold your hand above it; it should feel hot. Drop a bit of egg into the pan; if it sizzles and cooks at once, the pan is ready. Pour in the egg mixture. Tilt the pan to distribute the eggs evenly over the surface. Shake the pan gently, tilting it slightly with one hand while lifting up the edges of the frittata with a wooden or plastic spatula in your other hand, so as to let layers of eggs form during the first few minutes of cooking. Once a few layers of egg have cooked, arrange the tomato slices on top of the frittata, turn the heat down to low and cover the pan. (Use a pizza pan if you don\u2019t have a lid that will fit your skillet.) Cook 10 minutes, shaking the pan gently every once in a while. From time to time, remove the lid and loosen the bottom of the frittata with the spatula, tilting the pan so that the bottom doesn\u2019t burn. The eggs should be just about set; cook a few minutes longer if they\u2019re not."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, heat the broiler. Uncover the pan and place under the broiler, not too close to the heat, for one to three minutes, watching carefully to make sure the top doesn\u2019t burn. (At most, it should brown very slightly and puff under the broiler.) Remove from the heat, shake the pan to make sure the frittata isn\u2019t sticking, and allow it to cool for 5 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle on the remaining marjoram or thyme. Loosen the edges with the spatula. Carefully slide from the pan onto a large round platter. Cut into wedges.
