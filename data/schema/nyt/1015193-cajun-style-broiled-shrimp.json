Wild shrimp from the Pacific or the Gulf of Mexico is a treat if you can find it. Fresh local shrimp from Maine or the Carolinas is an even rarer gem. (These are all preferable from a sustainability perspective.) A vast majority, of course, is farmed and frozen. If you buy it \u2018\u2018individually quick frozen\u2019\u2019 in resealable bags, you can take out only as many as you want and thaw them by leaving the shrimp in the fridge for 24 hours or running them under cool water for an hour or less. Here, it is made Cajun with cayenne, paprika and garlic and quickly broiled.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/23/dining/23COOKING-CAJUNSTYLESHRIMP1/23COOKING-CAJUNSTYLESHRIMP1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 530}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 187, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "964 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 garlic clove", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne", "1 teaspoon paprika", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "lots of black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds peeled shrimp", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn on the broiler, and put the rack close to heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mash 1 garlic clove with 1 teaspoon salt until it forms a paste."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add to it 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 2 tablespoons olive oil and lots of black pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rub paste all over 1 1/2 pounds peeled shrimp."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Broil, 2 to 3 minutes per side."}]}
