{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spice-Rubbed Braised Brisket", "description": "With its assertive coffee and spice rub, this brisket cooks long enough to become very tender. A final sear under the broiler thickens the sauce into a glaze for the top. This recipe calls for the lean first cut, also known as the flat cut, and works with the much fattier second cut, sometimes labeled the point cut or deckle. This dish is delicious the day it\u2019s made, but tastes even better prepared ahead of time. After chilling, the meat is easier to slice and the fat a snap to remove.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/09/dining/04leisurerex1-brisket/merlin_180332973_58ba6c49-bd7e-42ea-9d75-e77a251cc2c6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, project, roasts, main course", "keywords": "brisket, coffee, dutch oven, onion, pomegranate juice, red wine, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1260}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons finely ground coffee", "1 tablespoon smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 (4- to 5-pound) first-cut brisket", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large onion, sliced", "6 garlic cloves, peeled", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1 1/2 cups pomegranate juice", "1 cup chicken stock or water", "1 1/2 pounds cipollini onions or small shallots, peeled", "1 cup lightly packed Italian parsley leaves with tender stems", "1 teaspoon lemon juice (from 1 lemon)", "2 teaspoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/4288-garlic-mashed-potatoes\">Mashed potatoes</a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the brisket: Heat oven to 300 degrees.
