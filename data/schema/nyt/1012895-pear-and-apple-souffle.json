This one will impress everyone at your table. Make the fruit puree well in advance, and beat the egg whites before you sit down to dinner. Then, when you\u2019re too full to eat anything more, fold the two together and put the souffl\u00e9s in the oven. Just when you\u2019re beginning to think you could eat a little dessert, they\u2019ll be ready.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/11/24/health/24recipehealth_600/24recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "Serves six", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apple, pear, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 63}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 198, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "76 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1 pound apples, peeled, cored and diced", "1 1/2 pounds ripe, juicy pears, peeled, cored and diced", "1/3 cup sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger", "Butter for the ramekin (or ramekins)", "8 large egg whites", "1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a bowl with water, and add the juice of 1/2 lemon.

It may or may not look like applesauce, depending on the texture of the apples and pears that you used (Granny Smith apples, for example, will break down, whereas Galas will not).
