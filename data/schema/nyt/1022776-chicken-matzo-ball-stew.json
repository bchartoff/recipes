{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Matzo Ball Stew", "description": "Matzo balls spiced with ginger and nutmeg transform this hearty, earthy stew into a nourishing one-pot dinner, reminiscent of chicken and dumplings but much lighter and simpler to make. The process of chilling the broth and skimming the fat is the only part requiring much attention, but it also means that this meal can be made almost entirely ahead of time. You can use the skimmed fat to add more flavor to the matzo balls, but if you don\u2019t have the time, just use olive oil instead, or buy some schmaltz. If you have leftover Thanksgiving turkey, you can also use it here in place of the chicken, and skip Step 1. Just add enough stock so that the stew is the consistency you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/24/dining/19SOUPREX-chicken-matzo-ball-stew/merlin_197671461_ba1c5171-2c87-4c97-83e2-53709886e036-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "chicken, matzo meal, plan-ahead, thanksgiving leftover, hanukkah", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 545}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large onion, peeled and cut in large chunks", "1 celery stalk, sliced in chunks", "1 turnip or parsnip, scrubbed, halved if large, and cut in thick slices", "Salt", "1 cut-up chicken with bones (about 4 pounds)", "2 carrots, peeled and cut in thick rounds", "1 cup fresh or frozen peas", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley or dill, for serving", "4 large eggs, beaten", "2 tablespoons schmaltz (from the stew) or vegetable oil", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons chicken stock or vegetable stock", "1 cup matzo meal", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger", "2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley, dill or cilantro", "Coarse kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start the stew: Set a large (5-quart) heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the oil and then the onion, celery and turnip, and season with salt.
