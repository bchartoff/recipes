{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quick Rag\u00f9 With Ricotta and Lemon", "description": "Meat rag\u00f9 traditionally requires a long simmer over low heat, but this 45-minute version owes its slow-cooked flavor to a hefty dose of red-pepper or chile paste, which yields a complex, hearty sauce. (This recipe calls for sambal oelek, which is easy to find, but Calabrian chile or Hungarian paprika paste would work well, too.) Spoon the rag\u00f9 over cooked, broken lasagna noodles and top it with a dollop of creamy ricotta, a sprinkle of toasted fennel and a few curls of lemon zest. This recipe uses beef, but you could also prepare it with spicy Italian sausage, or ground pork or turkey \u2014 though you may want to amplify the flavor by tossing in a little fennel seed and red-pepper flakes with the onion and garlic in Step 1.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/dining/sc-weeknight-beef-ragu/merlin_154348221_ba4c3b05-1ecb-4420-8967-1ec0c6fea5fe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "fennel seeds, ground beef, lemon, red wine, ricotta, sambal oelek, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 400}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 medium onion, thinly sliced", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "1 pound ground beef", "2 heaping tablespoons sambal oelek (or any spicy red-pepper paste)", "1/4 cup full-bodied red wine, like cabernet or merlot", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, with their juices", "8 ounces plain or whole-wheat lasagna noodles (not no-cook), broken in 1- to 2-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon fennel seeds", "1 cup fresh ricotta", "1 lemon, zested", "Flaky salt, like Maldon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat 1/4 cup oil over medium.
