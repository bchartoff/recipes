{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black-Eyed Pea and Pork Gumbo", "description": "The chefs Donald Link and Stephen Stryjewski serve this gumbo regularly at Cochon, their Cajun-Southern restaurant in New Orleans. Its ingredients depart significantly from traditional New Orleans restaurant gumbos, which almost never feature pork, legumes or greens, although those norms have changed in recent years, in part due to Cochon\u2019s influence. As a rule, when seasoning gumbo, Mr. Link uses just 75 percent of the suggested spice portions at first, then adds the rest as desired according to taste. Since this recipe can produce varying results, depending on whether you\u2019re using smoked pork butt from a local barbecue joint or a store-bought variety, home-cooked black-eyed peas or canned, braised collards or mustard greens, Mr. Link\u2019s seasoning approach is particularly useful.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brett Anderson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/dining/09gumborex4/merlin_147493782_1b48d5c2-c37d-4a68-a9b8-8fd39348e268-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "black-eyed peas, collard greens, gumbo file powder, mustard greens, okra, pork butt, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 79}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 563, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1337 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup peanut or vegetable oil", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 cup diced white or yellow onion", "1/2 cup diced green bell pepper", "1/2 cup diced celery", "2 tablespoons chopped garlic", "3 quarts pork or chicken stock, plus more as needed", "1 tablespoon gumbo fil\u00e9 powder", "1 tablespoon ground black pepper", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground white pepper", "1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme", "1 1/2 teaspoons chile powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cayenne", "2 bay leaves", "1 tablespoon lard or olive oil", "3/4 pound okra, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds", "1 cup homemade or store-bought <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019833-stewed-black-eyed-peas\">cooked and drained black-eyed peas</a>", "1 cup\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019750-braised-collard-greens\">braised collard</a> or mustard greens", "1 1/4 pounds homemade or store-bought smoked pork butt or shoulder, chopped", "Kosher salt", "Steamed rice or potato salad, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the roux:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat the peanut or vegetable oil over medium-high.
