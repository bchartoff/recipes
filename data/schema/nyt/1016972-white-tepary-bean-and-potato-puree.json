{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Tepary Bean and Potato Pur\u00e9e", "description": "Tepary beans are very small beans native to the Southwest and Mexico. They are among the most drought-tolerant foods in the world \u2013 they would have to be, grown as they are during the extremely hot, dry summers in the Sonora desert and southern Arizona. A dietary staple of native American tribes in Arizona, they are very high in protein and have a low glycemic index. There are two varieties, brown and white. I\u2019m using small white tepary beans here; regular small white navy beans can be substituted. The teparies have a particularly sweet, meaty flavor. The pur\u00e9e, which is in some ways like a white bean brandade, isn\u2019t a main dish, it is more of a comforting, high-protein stand-in for mashed potatoes. But it is substantial.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/10/health/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "Yield: Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 17}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 171, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "216 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound / 1 1/8 cups tepary beans or small white beans, soaked in 1 quart water for at least 4 hours or overnight", "1 onion, cut in half", "2 large garlic cloves, crushed", "1 bay leaf", "2 sprigs thyme", "Salt to taste", "3/4 pound Yukon gold or other fairly starchy potatoes, peeled and cut in large dice", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (more to taste)", "2 garlic cloves, minced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain soaked beans and place in a large saucepan or Dutch oven with 1 quart water, the onion and crushed garlic cloves.
