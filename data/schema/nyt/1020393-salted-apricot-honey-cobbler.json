The idea is to spoon out one of the barely sweetened, oaty shortcakes from the pan and then top it with the roasted, honey-sweetened fruit. Ice cream is optional but recommended.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/14/dining/13romanrex4/13romanrex4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "apricot, honey, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 79}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups/175 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/55 grams quick-cooking oats", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 1-inch pieces, chilled", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream, plus more for brushing shortcakes", "Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling", "2 pounds/900 grams apricots, pitted and halved (or quartered if very large)", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters honey", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "2 tablespoons fresh lime or lemon juice", "Pinch of kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the shortcake topping: Combine flour, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.
