{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Almond Cluster Granola", "description": "As terrific as homemade granola tastes, its texture often lacks the thick, crunchy clusters found in store-bought versions. This recipe is an exception, filled with crisp, sweet clumps of oats, coconut flakes and seeds. The secret is grinding a portion of the oats and coconut into flour, which helps bind the ingredients together. Feel free to mix up the spices, nuts and seeds to taste, and to add dried fruit or chocolate chips after it cools if you like. Granola is adaptable, so make it the way you like it. You can also cut the brown sugar in half. The granola will be less sweet and less cluster-packed but still quite satisfying.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/05/multimedia/clark-cluster-granola/clark-cluster-granola-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "almond, coconut flakes, coconut milk, coconut oil, maple syrup, oats, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 228}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 310, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "181 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/120 milliliters coconut oil", "1 tablespoon olive oil (or use more coconut oil)", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters pure maple syrup", "2/3 cup/160 grams packed turbinado or light brown sugar", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters coconut or almond milk \u00a0", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "5 cups/455 grams old-fashioned rolled oats", "1 cup/50 grams unsweetened coconut flakes", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground ginger or cardamom", "1 cup/85 grams sliced almonds", "1/2 cup/70 grams raw pumpkin seeds", "1/2 cup/65 grams sunflower seeds (optional, or use more pumpkin seeds or almonds)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
