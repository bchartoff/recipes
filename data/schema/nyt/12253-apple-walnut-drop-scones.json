{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple-Walnut Drop Scones", "description": "There are many reasons an apple a day may keep the doctor away. Among popular fruits, apples rank second (after cranberries) in antioxidant power, according to the nutritionist Jonny Bowden. They are extremely high in phenolic compounds (polyphenols), particularly quercetin, and if the apple is red, anthocyanins. These phytochemicals carry many health benefits, both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Apples have been linked to lower rates of heart disease in several studies. <br/><br/>The phytonutrients in apples are concentrated in and right under the skin. So whenever it\u2019s possible when you\u2019re cooking with apples, it\u2019s best not to peel them. Seek out organic apples if possible, as the skin is also where you\u2019ll find most of the pesticide residue, and conventionally farmed apples are on the Environmental Working Group\u2019s list of the most contaminated produce.<br/><br/>Scones are easy to make and lend themselves to whole-grain flours. These are particularly moist because of the grated apples.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/10/science/09recipehealth/09recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "12 scones", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apple, flour, walnut, dessert, side dish, fall, healthy, low cholesterol, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 56}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 169, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "138 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["150 grams (about 1 1/3 cups) whole-wheat pastry flour", "60 grams (about 1/2 cup) unbleached all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "50 grams (about 1/4 cup) raw brown sugar", "Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 tablespoon walnut oil", "5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon finely chopped or grated lemon zest", "1/2 cup buttermilk", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1  sweet or tart apple, grated", "50 grams (about 1/2 cup) walnuts, coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
