There\u2019s a learning curve. Only experience can teach you how the dough should feel and how thin to roll it. (Not that it needs to be rolled by hand with a rolling pin. A hand-crank pasta machine is a fine tool, perfect for a small batch.) But pasta making isn\u2019t rocket science either. Most competent home cooks will succeed, even if they never match the prowess of mythic Italian nonnas. Fresh homemade egg pasta is definitely worth the effort, though, and it is always better than commercially produced versions.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/06/dining/06KITCH2/06KITCH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "pastas, project", "keywords": "eggs, flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 316}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 285, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "185 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "2 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks, beaten", "Semolina or rice flour, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl.
