{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pesce all\u2019Acqua Pazza (Fish With White Wine and Cherry Tomatoes)", "description": "Easy enough for a weeknight, this simple, simmered fish dish originated along the Amalfi coast, where seafood is eaten regularly. Acqua pazza, which means \u201ccrazy water\u201d in Italian, is derived from the way Neapolitan fisherman used to cook the day\u2019s catch; in seawater, imbuing it with salty notes. This recipe calls for simmering fish over a simple broth seasoned with burst tomatoes, wine, salted water and the caramelized bits created by first quickly searing the fish in olive oil. Like many Italian dishes, the preparation is simple and requires only a few ingredients. Canned tomatoes can be substituted for the cherry, but if using out-of-season cherry tomatoes, a pinch of sugar can revive and build complex flavor. To round out the meal, serve with some crusty bread to sop up the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Anna Francese Gass"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/12/multimedia/afg-pesce-all-acqua-pazza-1-a578/afg-pesce-all-acqua-pazza-1-a578-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "basil, cherry tomato, cod, garlic, halibut, quick, red pepper flake, seafood, skillet, white fish, white wine, yellow onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 224}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (8-ounce) skinless white fish fillets, such as cod or halibut, preferably of an even thickness", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small yellow onion, minced", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes\u00a0", "4 cups cherry tomatoes", "1/2 cup white wine", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar (optional)", "3 to 4 basil leaves, torn into small pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the fish with salt and pepper on both sides.
