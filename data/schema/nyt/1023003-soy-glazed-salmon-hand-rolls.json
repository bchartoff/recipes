{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soy-Glazed Salmon Hand Rolls", "description": "Unagi sauce is a sweet, thickened soy sauce traditionally used on grilled eel. Here, the simple sauce of soy sauce, sugar and mirin is enhanced with the addition of aromatic garlic and ginger, transforming it into a savory glaze for buttery salmon. Once the salmon is roasted and lacquered in the sauce, it becomes the perfect filling for customizable hand rolls. A perfect roll is assembled with the flaked salmon and some creamy avocado and crisp cucumbers for bites that are rich, fresh and crunchy all at once. Including cooked short-grain rice in the filling is traditional, but these rolls would be a great place to use other leftover grains like farro or quinoa.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/24/dining/kc-soy-glazed-salmon-hand-rolls/merlin_202658622_c3494458-e8e1-4114-9cb2-9a4948efcf80-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 953}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1/2 teaspoon minced garlic", "1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/3 cup mirin", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more for seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon peeled grated ginger", "1 (1 1/2-pound) skinless salmon fillet (preferably center-cut)", "Toasted seaweed sheets, quartered", "Cooked short-grain rice and wasabi paste (optional), for serving\u00a0", "3 Persian cucumbers, halved crosswise and cut lengthwise into thin spears", "1 to 2 avocados, pitted and thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
