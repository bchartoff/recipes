{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sunset Pavlova With Sweet Vinegar and Rosemary", "description": "A Pavlova is among the best desserts to serve at a dinner party, as it brings the wow factor but is also very forgiving. If the meringue cracks in places, you don\u2019t need to fuss as you\u2019ll be covering it with cream and fruit. You can play with the flavoring of the cream and change up the fruits. If you can\u2019t find kumquats, feel free to swap them out for muscat or green seedless grapes, or an orange, peeled and sliced into rounds. You can make the meringue base up to two days in advance, as long as you let it cool completely before storing in an airtight container. Keep it in the coolest part of your kitchen, away from direct sunlight, to avoid any humidity.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/14/magazine/14mag-eat-site/14mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "cream, egg whites, fruit, meringue, orange juice, superfine sugar, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 315}, "recipeIngredient": ["7 ounces/200 grams egg whites (from 6 to 7 large eggs), at room temperature", "1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/370 grams superfine (caster) sugar", "2 teaspoons cornstarch", "2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar", "Scant \u00bd cup/100 milliliters orange juice", "3 tablespoons/40 milliliters apple cider vinegar", "4 fresh rosemary sprigs, plus 1 teaspoon chopped leaves, for serving", "1/4 cup/50 grams superfine (caster) sugar", "2 teaspoons lemon juice", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters heavy whipping cream", "Scant 1/2 cup/100 grams mascarpone", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon/30 grams superfine (caster) sugar", "8 cardamom pods, shells discarded and seeds finely crushed or ground", "2 large ripe but firm nectarines", "3 ripe but firm yellow or red plums", "6 kumquats (or 1 orange, peeled and sliced into rounds, or additional muscat grapes)", "1 cup/100 grams seedless muscat grapes", "2 passion fruits, halved and insides scraped, or \u00bc cup passion fruit pur\u00e9e"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the meringue: Add the egg whites to the base of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place and beat on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes.
