{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Buttermilk Pull-Apart Rolls", "description": "With its luscious mouthfeel and round flavor, the sweet potato is a quintessential soul food ingredient. In this recipe, from \u201cTanya Holland\u2019s California Soul: Recipes From a Culinary Journey West\u201d (Ten Speed Press, 2022), Ms. Holland uses the vegetable\u2019s texture and flavor as background notes in these buttery pull-apart rolls. While you can make the dough easily using a stand mixer, you can also do it by hand with a whisk, achieving the same finished product. Serve the rolls with room temperature butter for spreading, or alongside a soup, for soaking up broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Korsha Wilson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/30/dining/30hollandrex3-sweet-potato-rolls/30hollandrex3-sweet-potato-rolls-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "15 rolls", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack", "keywords": "buttermilk, instant yeast, make-ahead, plan-ahead, roll and bun, soul food, sweet potato, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 144}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small orange-fleshed sweet potato (6 ounces), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "Salt", "1/2 cup buttermilk", "1/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing and about 3 tablespoons melted butter for brushing the rolls", "4 cups/512 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast (1 envelope)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, combine the sweet potato with enough water to cover.
