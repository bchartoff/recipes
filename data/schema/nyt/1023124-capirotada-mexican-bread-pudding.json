{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Capirotada (Mexican Bread Pudding)", "description": "Capirotada is a seasonal dish eaten for Lent or Cuaresma, a time of the year when many Mexican households whip up meatless meals on Fridays. This cinnamon-scented bread pudding is a balance of textures, and sweet and slightly savory flavors. Its array of garnishes vary, and families debate which ingredients should make the cut and which should be forgotten. In Zacatecas, Mexico, onion is an unexpected ingredient that ties together the piloncillo and cheese. This dish can be made traditional or plant-based by selecting dairy-based or vegan butter and cheese. The key ingredient is a stale or lightly toasted baguette, birote or bolillo, which absorbs sweet piloncillo syrup melded with melted cheese, and holds up your chosen ingredients.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/11/dining/jr-capirotada/merlin_204367458_2cf9bca3-0389-46a7-b846-52f05f2750ef-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "apple, banana, bread pudding, stale bread, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 271}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large Gala apple, quartered", "1 medium yellow onion, quartered and peeled", "1 (8-ounce/226-gram) piloncillo cone", "3 cinnamon sticks, preferably Ceylon", "4 whole cloves", "Pinch of salt", "3 medium bananas", "1 tablespoon vegan butter", "1 large baguette or 3 to 4 large bolillos or birotes (about 14 ounces total), cut into 1-inch cubes and dried until stale or lightly toasted (see Tip)", "1/2 cup/3 ounces raisins", "1/2 cup/2 ounces almond slices or peanuts, plus more for serving", "1 packed cup/4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack-style vegan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the apple, onion, piloncillo, cinnamon, cloves, salt and 1 whole peeled banana to a medium pot.
