Instead of bathing the garlic and anchovy in the oil, Mr. Brock has you bathe a whole head of cauliflower in it. You use a ring mold to hold up the cauliflower in a saut\u00e9 pan, then brown it by spooning over bubbling oil and butter \u2014 a process that\u2019s fun and a little hairy \u2014 and finish it in the oven. In place of garlic, you use fermented black garlic (which is soft and woodsy in flavor) and milk powder to make a \u201ccrumble.\u201d You slice the cauliflower into large slabs, like cross-sections of a tree, and top them with an anchovy butter and the crumble.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/11/08/magazine/whole-cauliflower/whole-cauliflower-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, black garlic, cauliflower, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 8}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 781, "unsaturatedFatContent": "40 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "84 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "40 grams", "sodiumContent": "472 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup nonfat powdered milk", "10 black garlic cloves, peeled (see note)", "Half the reserved brown butter (3-4 tablespoons)", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 anchovy fillets", "Salt", "Grated zest from 1/2 lemon", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1/3 cup chopped parsley", "1 small head cauliflower", "1/2 cup olive oil", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the black-garlic crumble: place the butter, powdered milk and black garlic cloves in a medium saucepan over low heat and cook until the powdered milk is golden brown and nutty, 20 minutes.
