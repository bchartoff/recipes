{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thin Pan-Seared Pork Chops", "description": "Double-thick pork chops always look appetizing, but unless they are cooked perfectly, they tend to be dry, regardless of whether you grill or bake them. That's especially true if they are lean loin chops. But skinny chops cooked over high heat on the stovetop are far more apt to come out juicy. Giving them an hour in quickly made brine adds even more flavor and tenderness. Ask your butcher to cut thin chops that weigh 4 to 5 ounces.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/22/dining/22KITCH1/22KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, steaks and chops", "keywords": "arugula, pecorino, pork chops, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 297}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup kosher salt", "1/4 cup granulated or brown sugar", "2 bay leaves", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds", "12 black peppercorns, lightly crushed", "6 allspice berries, lightly crushed", "8 thin, bone-in pork chops, also known as breakfast chops, 4 to 5 ounces each (about 2 1/2 pounds total)", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and black pepper", "5 ounces baby arugula (about 4 cups), or a mixture of arugula, tender\u00a0parsley leaves and mint leaves", "Pecorino cheese, for shaving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the brine: In a nonreactive large bowl or large deep baking dish, combine salt, sugar, bay leaves, coriander, peppercorns and allspice.
