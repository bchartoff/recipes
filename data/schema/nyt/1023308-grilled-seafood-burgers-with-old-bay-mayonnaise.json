{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Seafood Burgers With Old Bay Mayonnaise", "description": "Tender cod and sweet shrimp transform into juicy seafood burgers that are perfect for easy summer grilling. The shrimp do double duty here: They act as a natural binder, eliminating the need for bread crumbs and eggs and giving the burgers a pure seafood essence. They also lend a snappy, firm texture to the patties. A quick cook on the grill imparts great smoky notes that complement the fish, and an Old Bay mayo sauce highlights the seafood flavors even further.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/10/dining/kc-seafood-burgers/kc-seafood-burgers-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, burgers, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cod, hamburger buns, shrimp, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 547}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as safflower or canola, plus more for greasing the grates", "1/2 pound cleaned large shrimp, cut into thirds", "12 ounces cod fillet, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped scallions", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "1 tablespoon Old Bay seasoning", "4 toasted hamburger buns", "Lemon wedges, for serving", "Shredded iceberg lettuce and sliced dill pickles"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a grill to medium and oil the grates."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, pulse the shrimp a few times just until finely chopped and a coarse paste forms.
