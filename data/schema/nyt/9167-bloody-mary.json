Apple Jr., who explored the origins of Worcestershire sauce, \u201cperhaps best known as an indispensable ingredient\" in the cocktail. Mr. Apple\u2019s version doesn\u2019t stray far from tradition, featuring the sauce prominently. Serve this version with a simple garnish of lime at your next brunch. (Betsey, Mr. Apple's wife, noted in the comments below that she always added horseradish and celery salt to those she served him at home. We think that's a grand idea.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "R. W.
