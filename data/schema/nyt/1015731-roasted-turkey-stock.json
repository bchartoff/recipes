{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Turkey Stock", "description": "When you\u2019re making a turkey, making stock with the bones is the logical next step. This recipe, from the Los Angeles chef Suzanne Goin, has the usual aromatics \u2014 carrots, celery, onions \u2014 plus a concentrated shot of white wine and a dried chile, which add a welcome breath of freshness. (Sometimes poultry stock can taste flat.) Roasting the bones and the vegetables in the same pan streamlines the process and adds depth of flavor. You can use this stock in virtually any recipe that calls for chicken stock (except for chicken soup).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/20/dining/video-recipelab-turkey-stock/video-recipelab-turkey-stock-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 3 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "turkey bones, turkey stock", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 308}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 157, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "291 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 leftover carcass from a 10- to 15-pound roasted turkey, preferably including neck, wing and leg bones", "4 or 5 onions, quartered (no need to peel; just rub off any papery skins)", "2 large or 3 small carrots, peeled and cut into chunks", "4 large or 5 small celery ribs, cut into chunks", "2 cups white wine", "2 large or 3 small garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "4 sprigs fresh thyme", "2 bay leaves", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "1 whole arbol (or another small dried red) chile", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
