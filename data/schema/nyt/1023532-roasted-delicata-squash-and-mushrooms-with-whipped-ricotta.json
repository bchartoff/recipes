{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Delicata Squash and Mushrooms With Whipped Ricotta", "description": "Delicata squash has a delicate, edible skin, which eliminates the need to peel the fruit before roasting.

Ricotta cheese is transformed into a cool, creamy sauce with flavors reminiscent of ranch dressing; a quick spin in the food processor renders the grainy ricotta smooth and silky. Leftover sauce thickens in the fridge and makes a tasty spread for sandwiches, avocado toast or bagels and lox.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/19/dining/kc-squash-and-mushroom-roast/merlin_214747671_706e2445-00e4-4204-82cf-96409d2f21c0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "cremini, food processor, portobello, ricotta, squash, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 386}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound mixed mushrooms (ideally a combination of whole cremini or white button mushrooms and stemmed portobello mushrooms, caps sliced \u00bd inch thick)", "2 1/2 pounds delicata squash (2 medium), halved lengthwise, seeded and sliced crosswise 1 inch thick", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup/8 ounces ricotta cheese", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "2 tablespoons chopped chives, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a large rimmed baking sheet, combine mushrooms, squash, olive oil, thyme and 3 of the minced garlic cloves; season with salt and pepper.
