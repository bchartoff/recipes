{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tofu-Vegetable Satay With Peanut Sauce", "description": "Caramelized pineapple, tofu and vegetables take center stage in these vegan satay, which are inspired by Indonesian charcoal-grilled skewers. Here, the smoky satay are glazed with sweet and sticky kecap manis, a fermented sweet soy sauce (see Tip), which also flavors the peanut sauce along with garlic, shallots and chile. The sauce is meant to be generously poured over the satay to serve, but any leftovers will last for one week in the refrigerator. The sauce thickens over time, so loosen it with extra water as needed. Serve the satay and peanut sauce with steamed rice or noodles, and a side of stir-fried greens or roast potatoes.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lara Lee"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/29/dining/ll-vegetable-satay/merlin_194651904_5a6b518a-cdc5-4bfa-9941-3de69fc9c487-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "24 skewers (4 to 6 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "kecap manis, pineapple, scallion, tofu, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 581}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) package firm tofu, drained", "5 large scallions", "1 large eggplant (about 1 pound), cut into 1-inch cubes", "1/2 large (4-pound) pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces", "24 (8-inch) bamboo skewers, soaked overnight (or at least 30 minutes)", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as canola", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola", "2 medium shallots, peeled and sliced", "4 long, red, medium-spicy chiles (such as serrano, cayenne or finger chiles), sliced and seeds removed, if you prefer less heat", "6 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced", "2/3 cup/150 grams crunchy peanut butter, natural or conventional", "10 tablespoons kecap manis (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the satay: Place the tofu in a folded dish towel and gently press to remove excess liquid.
