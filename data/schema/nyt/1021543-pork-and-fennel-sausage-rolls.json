{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork and Fennel Sausage Rolls", "description": "In this Australian lunchtime staple, fennel- and herb-spiked ground meat makes a heady filling for crisp and buttery puff pastry. The original recipe, created by Paul Allam from Bourke Street Bakery, calls for ground pork. But ground chicken, turkey or plant-based meat will also work. These are best served while still warm from the oven, but they\u2019re nearly as delicious at room temperature. Store any leftovers in the refrigerator and reheat before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/dining/16apperex3-pork/merlin_178200114_00a4492b-5506-4e4f-b963-029f5dcb320c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 sausage rolls", "recipeCuisine": "australian, british", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, finger foods, meat, main course", "keywords": "fennel seeds, pork, puff pastry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 368}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 fat garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 tablespoon fennel seeds, plus more for finishing", "3 thyme sprigs, leaves separated chopped", "1 small red, yellow or white onion, diced", "1/2 cup diced celery", "1/2 cup diced carrots", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 pound lean ground pork (or chicken, turkey, or plant-based meat)", "1/4 cup bread crumbs", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 (14- to 16-ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed but still cold", "1 egg, beaten, for egg wash"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees and line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium.
