{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lalla Mussa Dal", "description": "This creamy lentil stew \u2014 a signature dish of the Indian celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor \u2014 has a base of urad dal, a slim variety of lentil that turns soft and velvety when cooked. The dal is hearty, with multiple levels of richness from the cream and butter. But its tangy complexity comes from a combination of tomatoes, garlic, coriander and fenugreek. (Look for the dried version of the greens from the fenugreek plant, not the brownish nuggets known simply as \u201cfenugreek\u201d on the spice shelf. You can also use the mixture of fenugreek greens, dried dill and dried leek sold at many Indian grocers.)  Like most dals, this stew is best accompanied by long-grain basmati rice or roti \u2014 both excellent vehicles for sopping up the thick gravy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/07/dining/07investrex/merlin_134768649_5ae2e44f-895e-4c99-91e2-0bb789d9764d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans", "keywords": "fenugreek leaves, green chiles, lentils, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 102}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 355, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "345 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup whole black gram lentils (sabut urad)", "1/8 cup whole green gram lentils (sabut moong)", "2 green chiles (such as Indian harimirch or serrano), cut into thin strips", "1 1-inch piece ginger, cut into thin strips", "1/2 cup melted unsalted butter", "3/4 cup tomato pur\u00e9e", "1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder, or cayenne", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "3/4 teaspoon crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi)", "7 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "Salt to taste", "1 1/2-inch piece ginger, cut into thin strips, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix together both types of lentils and rinse thoroughly in salted water.
