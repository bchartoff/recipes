{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Hash With Brussels Sprouts and Parsnips", "description": "Though it\u2019s derived from a French word that means chopped, hash is quintessentially American. It\u2019s most often made with roasted or boiled meat (sometimes corned beef) and potatoes, cut into cubes and fried into a crisp-bottomed cake. Invariably, it\u2019s then topped with an egg, poached or fried. This one, made with roast turkey, makes good use of holiday leftovers. Scallions and jalape\u00f1o lend it brightness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/26/dining/26KITCH/26KITCH-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, parsnip, turkey, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 172}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 597, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "775 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces parsnips, chopped, about 2 cups", "Butter, oil or lard", "4 ounces thick-sliced bacon, cut into 1/4-inch lardons", "1 large onion, diced, about 2 cups", "Salt and pepper", "1 pound cooked turkey, preferable dark meat, diced", "2 tablespoons chopped sage", "1 cup turkey or chicken broth", "1 1/2 cups slivered brussels sprouts", "6 scallions, chopped", "1 jalape\u00f1o, finely chopped", "4 to 6 eggs, for frying", "Cilantro sprigs for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Simmer parsnips in salted water for about 2 minutes, until cooked through but firm.
