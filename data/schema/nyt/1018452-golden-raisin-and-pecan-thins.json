{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Golden Raisin and Pecan Thins", "description": "These slightly sweet, extremely simple crackers, adapted from \"Better Baking\" by Genevieve Ko, can be stirred together in minutes in one bowl, no electric mixer required. They are then baked twice \u2013 once in loaf pans and once after freezing and slicing \u2013 making them crisp all the way through. Serve them with cheese or p\u00e2t\u00e9, or even on their own as a snack. And feel free to personalize these by substituting other dried fruits and nuts for the raisins and pecans. Chopped dried figs and hazelnuts make another wonderful combination.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/07/dining/07JPCOOKBOOK10/07JPCOOKBOOK10-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 8 dozen crackers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "crackers and chips", "keywords": "buttermilk, golden raisins, pecans, tarragon, whole wheat pastry flour, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 64}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 21, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "18 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter for pans", "1/2 cup/71 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/67 grams whole-wheat pastry flour", "1/3 cup/69 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon or crushed fennel seeds", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/245 grams buttermilk", "1 cup/109 grams pecans", "3/4 cup/125 grams golden raisins"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a baking sheet on center rack of oven and heat to 350 degrees.
