{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bulgogi Sloppy Joes With Scallion Salsa", "description": "The dish is the Korean barbecue standard known as bulgogi \u2014 \u201cfire meat,\u201d is the literal translation \u2014 transformed into a sandwich filling, a sloppy Joe for a more perfect union. (File under \u201cBlessings of Liberty.\u201d) Fed to children with a tall glass of milk, the sandwiches may inspire smiles and licked plates, rapt attention and the request that the meal be served at least monthly \u2014 they are not at all too spicy for younger palates. Given to adults accompanied by cold lager, cucumber kimchi and a pot of the fermented Korean hot-pepper paste known as <i>gochujang</i>, they can rise to higher planes. \n\nBulgogi sandwiches are a taste of the sort of home cooking that can lead to more home cooking. They serve as fragrant hamburger crushers, elegant vanquishers of pizza. They are an enemy of takeout.\n\nTo cook them, you can follow the instructions slavishly, as if working for Hooni Kim, the chef and owner of Danji, on the edge of the theater district in Manhattan. Bulgogi \u201csliders\u201d are a hallmark of his menu and by far the restaurant\u2019s most popular dish.
