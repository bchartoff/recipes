{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Japanese Souffl\u00e9 Pancakes", "description": "Japanese souffl\u00e9 pancakes start with the same ingredients as American varieties \u2014 namely, eggs, flour and milk \u2014 but they tower above traditional diner versions thanks to the addition of extra egg whites. A meringue mixture is beaten to stiff peaks, then folded into the batter, which cooks directly in metal pastry rings to help the pancakes attain their distinctive height. The key is to cook the batter at a very low temperature. If your stove has a small burner, or an especially low heat setting, use it here to create these custardy pancakes, worthy of breakfast, an afternoon snack or even dessert.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/dining/09pancakerex/merlin_152093436_8efda54f-e29a-40c5-92b3-fdbcbe490277-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 pancakes", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, pancakes", "keywords": "butter, cake flour, eggs, maple syrup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 773}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 95, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "101 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 egg whites and 2 egg yolks from 4 large eggs, separated and chilled", "6 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "6 tablespoons cake flour", "1/4 cup milk, chilled", "1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Unsalted butter, for greasing and serving", "Maple syrup, for serving", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, whipped cream and fresh berries, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer or a medium bowl; set aside.
