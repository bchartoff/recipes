{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sabich Bowls", "description": "The traditional Israeli sandwich known as sabich features fried eggplant that\u2019s tucked into pitas and topped with sliced hard-boiled eggs, chopped tomato-cucumber salad, pickles, tahini sauce and sometimes shredded cabbage. This weeknight recipe turns the popular sandwich into a one-bowl meal that is prepared on a sheet pan. Eggplant and chickpeas are roasted side by side; the eggplant becomes tender and creamy while the chickpeas turn golden and crispy. Canned chickpeas do double duty: Some are a part of the roast, while the remaining beans transform into a luscious, garlicky tahini sauce. The eggplant mixture is served on top of rice in this recipe, but all sorts of grains would work, including bulgur, farro and quinoa.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/19/multimedia/kc-sheet-pan-sabich-bowls-pmjl/kc-sheet-pan-sabich-bowls-pmjl-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, chickpea, cucumber, eggplant, food processor, grain bowl, grape tomato, lemon juice, tahini, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 486}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds Italian eggplant (1 large), cut into 1-inch cubes (8 cups)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed", "1/4 cup tahini", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce", "8 ounces grape or cherry medium tomatoes, chopped (1 heaping cup)", "1 Persian cucumber, cut into \u00bc-inch cubes (\u00bd cup)", "2 tablespoons coarsely chopped parsley, plus more for garnish", "4 cups cooked rice or grains, for serving", "Shredded cabbage, pickles (preferably Israeli), hot sauce, hard-boiled or fried eggs, for topping (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
