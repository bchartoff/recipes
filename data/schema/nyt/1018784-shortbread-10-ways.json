{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shortbread, 10 Ways", "description": "Shortbread is not only one of the easiest desserts you can possibly make, it\u2019s also one of the most adaptable. As long as you keep the butter-to-flour ratio constant (1 stick butter to 1 cup flour), everything else is negotiable. You can reduce or increase the sugar and salt, or mix in any type of flavoring from citrus zest to vanilla to herbs and spices. You can even alter the type of flour, swapping in some rice flour for all-purpose flour for increased crunch, or cornmeal for a nubby texture. Just be cautious about adding liquid to the dough; any more than one tablespoon could interfere with the texture. Here we give a master recipe and nine variations to play around with.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/14/dining/14APPE1/14APPE1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "24 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "butter, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 633}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 130, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "61 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/250 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon fine salt", "2 sticks/1 cup/226 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch chunks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
