{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tzatziki Potato Salad", "description": "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016438-tzatziki\">Tzatziki</a>, the classic Greek combination of garlic, yogurt and cucumber, is incredibly versatile and often served with grilled meat, gyros, roasted vegetables or simply flatbread. Here, it is the sauce for a fresh potato salad. Opt for a waxy potato, such as red, new or fingerlings, as these varieties contain the least starch and will retain their shape when boiled. (All-purpose Yukon Golds work, too.) The potatoes are left unpeeled for texture, but peel them if you prefer, and make sure they are roughly the same size to ensure even cooking. The tzatziki benefits from resting for at least 10 to 15 minutes before being added to the potatoes, so prepare it before you start the potatoes, or better yet, make it the night before and let it hang out in the fridge so the flavors can get to know one another. A little honey lends a floral, subtle sweetness, but omit it if you want this dish to be purely savory.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/11/dining/HM-Tzatziki-Potato-Salad/HM-Tzatziki-Potato-Salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, side dish", "keywords": "cucumber, greek yogurt, potato, potato salad, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1325}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 Persian or mini cucumbers, coarsely grated", "1 cup full-fat Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus more as needed", "2 teaspoons honey, plus more as needed (optional)", "1 garlic clove, grated", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 1/2 pounds small red, new or fingerling potatoes, washed and halved (or cut into 1-inch pieces, if large)", "3 Persian or mini cucumbers, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds", "1/3 cup black olives, such as Kalamata or oil-cured, pitted, and torn in half if large", "1/4 cup chopped dill", "1/4 cup chopped mint", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "1/2 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the tzatziki, place grated cucumber in a colander over the sink and squeeze vigorously to remove any excess moisture.
