{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Risotto with Tomatoes and Corn", "description": "This colorful risotto serves as a luxurious showcase for summer\u2019s bounty of tomatoes and corn. This is about as colorful and summery a risotto as you can get. The tomatoes and broth team up as a rich medium for the rice. Don\u2019t add the corn too soon, or it will develop a starchy texture like the rice. But cook it long enough to bring out its sweet flavor. Simmer the corn cobs for about 20 minutes in your broth to get a great sweet corn flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/22/science/25recipehealth/25recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "gluten-free, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 145}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 320, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1110 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 good-size ears sweet corn", "7 cups well-seasoned vegetable stock or chicken stock", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup minced onion", "Salt to taste", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 1/2 cups arborio rice", "1 pound tomatoes, grated or peeled, seeded and diced", "Pinch of sugar", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/2 cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc", "2 to 3 tablespoons slivered fresh basil, or a mix of basil, chives, and parsley", "1/4 to 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (1 to 2 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove corn kernels from cobs and set aside the kernels.
