{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Macadamia Butter", "description": "Macadamia nuts have the highest level of monounsaturated fats, but they are also expensive, since the macadamia tree only produces nuts after seven to 10 years. Making your own nut butter ensures that it contains just nuts \u2014 and none of the sugar or hydrogenated oils that some brands include. The roasted macadamia nuts are central to this butter, but try blending in pitted medjool dates for a little sweetness or folding in toasted coconut flakes for a tropical flavor. Spoon this macadamia nut butter over warm pancakes or waffles, or whisk a spoonful of the nut butter into salad dressings to add depth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/09/dining/kc-macadamia-butter/kc-macadamia-butter-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "macadamia nuts, salt", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound raw macadamia nuts (about 3 cups)", "Kosher salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
