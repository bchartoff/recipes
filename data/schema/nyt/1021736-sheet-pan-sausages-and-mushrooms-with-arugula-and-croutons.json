To start, sausages and mushrooms roast on a sheet pan, leaving behind seasoned pan drippings. Next, in a move inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015770-zuni-cafe-chicken\">Judy Rodgers\u2019s roast chicken</a> with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10721-warm-bread-salad\">bread salad</a> from Zuni Caf\u00e9 in San Francisco, torn bread pieces are tossed with the drippings, then sent back to the oven to toast. The toasted bread is then tossed with arugula, red-wine vinaigrette and the roasted mushrooms, making a great mix of crispy, tangy and spicy bites. Crusty bread can be hard to tear from the loaf, but the rough edges make a more interesting final product: To ease the process, slice the bread 1/2-inch-thick, then slice crosswise 1/2-inch thick, then tear little pieces from there.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/24/dining/as-sheet-pan-sausage-and-mushrooms/merlin_180333183_052af6e3-cec3-4b52-b8ab-546850f20db4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, one pot, salads and dressings, sausages, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "arugula, bread, italian sausage, mushroom, parsley, sausage, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1195}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound hot or sweet Italian sausages", "1 pound mixed mushrooms, such as shiitake, oyster, maitake or cremini, trimmed and quartered (or cut into 1-inch pieces if large)", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons red wine vinegar, plus more as needed", "1 garlic clove, coarsely chopped", "4 cups torn, bite-size pieces of crusty bread (6 to 8 ounces)", "2 cups arugula", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves", "Finely grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
