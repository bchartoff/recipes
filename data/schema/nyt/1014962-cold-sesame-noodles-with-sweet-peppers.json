I like to cook wheat udon and soba the Japanese way. Bring 3 or 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot.

Wait for the water to come back up to a rolling boil \u2014 it will bubble up, so don\u2019t fill the pot all the way \u2014 and add 1 cup of cold water. Allow the water to come back to a rolling boil, and add another cup of cold water. Allow the water to come to a boil one more time, and add a third cup of water. When the water comes to a boil again, the noodles should be cooked through.
