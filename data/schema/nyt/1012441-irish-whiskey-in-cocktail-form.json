But that is where it gets difficult. Ask a bartender for a classic Irish whiskey cocktail, and you\u2019re likely to get a long, pained pause. That\u2019s because Irish whiskey has kept its distance from the cocktail set. Like its peatier cousin, Scotch, it tends to be a curmudgeonly loner, preferring the company of just ice and a bit of water.\n\nThis recipe was created in 2009 by Anthony Malone, the Dublin-born general manager and bartender at Puck Fair, as part of a challenge to create a cocktail based on the traditional Irish breakfast \u2014 eggs, bacon, black and white pudding, and toast. Malone's drink combines Bushmills with cherry liqueur and orange juice, as in the Scotch-based Blood and Sand, along with a whole egg, \u201cfor that creamy consistency.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Miles"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/05/dining/Irish-Whiskey-in-Cocktail/Irish-Whiskey-in-Cocktail-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "for one", "keywords": "cherry liqueur, egg, irish whiskey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 182, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "62 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce Bushmills Irish whiskey", "1/2 ounce cherry liqueur", "1/2 ounce freshly squeezed orange juice", "1 whole egg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine ingredients in cocktail shaker with ice.
