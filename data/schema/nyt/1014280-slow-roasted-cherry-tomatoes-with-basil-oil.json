{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Roasted Cherry Tomatoes With Basil Oil", "description": "When you roast cherry tomatoes, they caramelize and become even sweeter. This dish was inspired by a huge pile of roasted red and yellow cherry tomatoes that a friend served at a dinner party recently; they were drizzled with diluted pesto and placed alongside a luxurious mound of burrata. You can serve these as an appetizer (have napkins close by) or side dish, or tossed with pasta. You can easily multiply this recipe, but you won\u2019t have to use much more olive oil to coat the tomatoes. This gorgeous emerald-colored oil is a condiment that you can keep in your refrigerator for up to a week. Keep it in a squeeze bottle, and drizzle it over tomatoes, fish, chicken or other vegetables. It looks beautiful on a white plate, and a little goes a long way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/07/27/science/26recipehealth/26recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 10 as an hors d\u2019oeuvre", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, healthy, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 163}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 145, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "56 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 baskets sweet cherry tomatoes (can use a mixture of colors)", "Salt to taste", "A couple of pinches of sugar", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "About 1 tablespoon basil olive oil (see below)", "Salt to taste", "2 cups basil", "1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
