{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pollo en Fricas\u00e9", "description": "The ultimate comfort food, this dish bears the mark of Spanish and French colonial influence, but takes a decidedly Puerto Rican approach. Bone-in chicken thighs are braised to perfection in a rich, oniony, tomato-based sauce with a lot of garlic, balanced with white wine and vinegar, and punctuated by briny olives and capers. Potatoes are added toward the end, for a satisfying meal. Like so many Puerto Rican dishes, this one is highly adaptable. Some brown the chicken first, adding sofrito and other aromatics later. Folks often add carrots, or use beer or red wine instead of white. My take is pared down and incredibly simple, making it an easy weeknight meal that can be prepared while you\u2019re getting your house in order after work.
