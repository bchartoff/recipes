{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Chicken Tenders", "description": "Chicken tenders may be known as a kid favorite, but it's hard to find an adult who doesn't enjoy them just as much. And there's a lot to love when a crisp, golden brown coating meets juicy, tender chicken strips. This weeknight version strays slightly from the traditional deep-fried recipe: It can be pan-fried (see tip below), but it shines when baked in the oven. Proper chicken tenders, or the smaller muscle underneath the breast, can be hard to find, but boneless, skinless breasts \u2014 from chicken, or even turkey \u2014 sliced into thin strips are an excellent stand-in. For a little punch, feel free to add cayenne, crushed red-pepper flakes or fennel seed, or ground cumin to the flour mixture. Lastly, this version is paired with an herbed yogurt dip, but it can also be served with ketchup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/31/dining/28COOKING-CHICKENTENDERS2/28COOKING-CHICKENTENDERS2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, finger foods, poultry", "keywords": "bread crumbs, chicken breast, chives, dill, paprika, parsley, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1641}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 765, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "70 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "60 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "972 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups full-fat Greek yogurt, labneh or sour cream", "1/4 cup finely chopped chives", "1/4 cup finely chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons finely chopped dill", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 small garlic clove, finely grated or chopped", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "2 large eggs, beaten to blend", "2 cups bread crumbs (preferably panko or other coarse bread crumbs)", "3 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dip: Mix yogurt, chives, parsley, dill, lemon juice and garlic in a small bowl; season with salt and plenty of pepper.
