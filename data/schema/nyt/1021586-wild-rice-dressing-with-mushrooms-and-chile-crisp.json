{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wild Rice Dressing With Mushrooms and Chile Crisp", "description": "This earthy side dish stands out brilliantly with its mix of mushrooms, wild rice and chile crisp. The contrast between the rice and mushrooms provides textural interest: soft and firm, tender and chewy. Halve  any larger mushrooms lengthwise to help them cook evenly. And be generous with the chile crisp, making sure to stir the mixture well. All of those crunchy bits carry flavor \u2014 and a mighty punch of savory heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/27/dining/ns-wild-rice-stuffing/ns-wild-rice-stuffing-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, stuffing and dressing, side dish", "keywords": "carrot, celery, chile crisp, cinnamon, dried cranberries, mushroom, stock, wild rice, fall, thanksgiving, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 239}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup mixed wild rice blend or wild rice", "2 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 (1-inch) cinnamon stick", "Fine sea salt", "2 to 4 cups low-sodium stock, preferably mushroom, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup diced white or yellow onion", "1 small carrot, peeled and diced", "1 celery rib, diced", "1/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries", "8 ounces mixed wild mushrooms or button mushrooms, halved if large", "1 tablespoon chile crisp, plus more for serving", "2 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Discard any debris from the rice.
