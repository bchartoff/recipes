This version, with shrimp, is more than a worthy substitute, and an excellent dish all its own. The dish takes its name from the French word \"\u00e9touff\u00e9e,\u201d which nods to its protein being smothered with sauce. This recipe uses a shortcut version of a roux: The flour is added after the onion, celery, bell pepper and garlic have already been saut\u00e9ed in the butter. If you omit the hot sauce, add apple cider vinegar in its place.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/07/dining/vl-shrimp-etouffee/vl-shrimp-etouffee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, creole seasoning, hot sauce, shrimp, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1482}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 yellow onion, finely chopped", "2 celery stalks, thinly sliced", "1/2 green bell pepper, finely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "3/4 cup chicken or vegetable stock", "1 tablespoon hot sauce, or to taste", "1 dried bay leaf", "2 teaspoons store-bought or homemade Creole seasoning (see Tip)", "Kosher salt and\u00a0black pepper", "1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined", "1 scallion, green parts chopped", "White rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.
