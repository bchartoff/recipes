{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mole Negro", "description": "Mole negro is one of the most striking and complex moles from the state of Oaxaca. The color and flavor come from nearly incinerating the chilhuacles negros, the native dried chiles used for the base. They\u2019re then rinsed and soaked to revive their flavor and to remove the bitterness from the charring. What results is a velvety black sauce that\u2019s traditionally served over roasted poultry, but also pairs beautifully with roasted vegetables and fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
