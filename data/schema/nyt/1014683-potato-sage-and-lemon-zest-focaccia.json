{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato, Sage and Lemon Zest Focaccia", "description": "There are a lot of focaccia styles out there. There are thick and fluffy ones, loaded with toppings, and crispy, oily ones with a minimalist sprinkle of salt. Then there\u2019s everything in between.\n\nI decided to stick to this middle ground and bake up something that had crisp edges while still being light and soft in the center.\n\nBaking the focaccia in a cake pan, a trick I learned from the Los Angeles chef Nancy Silverton, does just that. It encourages the exterior of the loaf to turn crunchy as it absorbs heat from the sides of the pan, while allowing the dough to rise nicely in the middle. A cake pan also made for a nice-looking, gently domed loaf, more evenly shaped than the flatter, hand-pressed focaccias I\u2019ve made in the past.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/24/dining/24APPE3/24APPE3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "1 (9-inch) focaccia", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, focaccia dough, gold potatoes, sage, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1215, "unsaturatedFatContent": "51 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "142 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "63 grams", "fiberContent": "13 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1407 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ball focaccia dough (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014681/Focaccia-Dough.html\">see recipe</a>)", "1/4 cup olive oil", "3 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled", "1 medium Yukon Gold potato (about 4 ounces), peeled", "1 tablespoon sage, finely chopped", "Finely grated zest of 1 small lemon", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
