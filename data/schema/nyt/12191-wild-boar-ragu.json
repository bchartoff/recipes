So he brought in his mother, Caterina Schenardi. This recipe is adapted from her and Daniele Boldrini, who grew up in Bologna. Ms. Schenardi is especially particular about the flour and egg in her tagliatelle, but here you can just use a store-bought version to go alongside, or use a noodle of your preference.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/28/dining/Boar-Ragu/Boar-Ragu-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "4 first-course servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, pastas", "keywords": "main course, pasta, wild boar, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 145}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 354, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "105 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound wild boar shoulder or leg, cut into 1- to 2-inch pieces", "1 rosemary sprig, torn in half", "4 garlic cloves, peeled", "2 cups Chianti or other red wine, or as needed", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small carrot, finely chopped", "1 small celery stalk, finely chopped", "1 small onion, finely chopped", "1 cup canned tomatoes, with their liquid", "2 cups vegetable stock or water", "Tagliatelle or other pasta, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The night before making the rag\u00f9 place the meat in a bowl with the rosemary, peppercorns, garlic and enough wine to cover.
