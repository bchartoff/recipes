{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brisket Barley Soup with Crispy Kale", "description": "Making soup out of brisket has a major advantage over the usual braising: Because you are cooking the meat submerged in broth, it stays juicy. As it simmers, the brisket cubes soften enough so you can cut them with your spoon. The chewiest thing in the soup will be the barley, but in a good way. Some slabs of brisket comes more thoroughly trimmed than others, so you may have to do some knife work when you get it home. But fear not, if your broth ends up a little greasy, just chill it and then spoon the fat off the top when it\u2019s cold.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/27/dining/27APPE/27APPE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "brisket, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 42}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 739, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "838 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds brisket, fat trimmed, cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 1/2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt, more as needed", "1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, more as needed", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "3 leeks, thinly sliced", "2 celery stalks, diced", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "3 thyme sprigs", "2 bay leaves", "2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks", "2 parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks", "2 medium turnips or kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2/3 cup pearled barley", "2 teaspoons white wine vinegar, more as needed", "10 ounces Tuscan kale (1 large bunch or 2 small), ribs removed and leaves sliced 1-inch thick"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season brisket with 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
