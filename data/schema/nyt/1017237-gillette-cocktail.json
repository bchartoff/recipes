The gimlet that drinkers came to know in the years after Prohibition usually called for Rose\u2019s Lime Juice, an achingly sweet potion. The St. Louis bartender Tom Bullock made his Gillette the way many mixologists make a gimlet today, with sugar and fresh lime juice instead of Rose\u2019s. He also called for the mildly sweet Old Tom gin instead of a London dry gin. The three ingredients result in a drink both gentle and piquant.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/dining/18BARTENDER1/18BARTENDER1-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "gin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 68}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 179, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 ounces Old Tom gin, preferably Hayman\u2019s", "1/2 ounce fresh lime juice", "1/2 teaspoon sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine ingredients in a cocktail shaker three-quarters filled with ice.
