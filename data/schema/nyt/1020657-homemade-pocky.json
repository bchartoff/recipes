They don\u2019t pretend to be the perfectly straight version from the box, but they're freshly baked and taste far better. They're also fun to make: The dough is forgiving and easy to work with, so shaping it is as simple as rolling a Play-Doh snake. Decorating presents an opportunity to go wild. Mix matcha powder or pulverized freeze-dried berries with white chocolate; pair milk chocolate with hazelnuts; or combine dark chocolate with almonds or pecans. Sprinkles, shredded coconut or sesame seeds add flair.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/ss-pocky/merlin_163734129_16c95838-5755-4c45-9dab-b78e283f6f79-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "34 cookie sticks", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "dark chocolate, flour, matcha, milk chocolate, nuts, white chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 251}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup/55 grams cold unsalted butter (1/2 stick), cut into pieces", "3 tablespoons whole milk", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 ounces/85 grams white chocolate, chopped (about 1/2 cup)", "3 ounces/85 grams milk chocolate, chopped (about 1/2 cup)", "3 ounces/85 grams dark chocolate, chopped (about 1/2 cup)", "Vegetable shortening, as needed", "1 tablespoon pulverized freeze-dried raspberries or strawberries, or 1/2 teaspoon matcha powder", "2 tablespoons cocoa nibs", "3 tablespoons chopped nuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: Add 1 1/4 cups flour, the sugar, baking powder and salt to a food processor, and pulse a few times to combine.
