{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mom\u2019s Famous Rum Cake", "description": "This classic rum cake recipe, built around a yellow cake mix, is a favorite of mushers and snowmobilers passing through the village of Tanana, Alaska, in the wintertime. It's hard to mess up, comes together quickly, fills out a (prepared) Bundt pan reliably and can be made on a whim with ingredients from the pantry. It travels well; keeps, covered, for several days; and pairs nicely with coffee and cold weather.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia O'Malley"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/18/dining/18cakemixrex1/18cakemixrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cake mix, instant pudding, rum, walnut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 121}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 836, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "92 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "43 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "690 milligrams", "sugarContent": "65 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter or vegetable oil, for greasing the pan", "1 cup/120 grams chopped walnuts or pecans", "1 (roughly 16-ounce/450-gram) package yellow cake mix", "1 (3.4-ounce/100-gram) package vanilla instant pudding mix", "4 large eggs", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters cold water", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters vegetable oil", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters rum (dark or light), preferably Bacardi", "1/2 cup (1 stick/115 grams) unsalted butter", "1 cup/200 grams sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters rum (dark or light)", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
