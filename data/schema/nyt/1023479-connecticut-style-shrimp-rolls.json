{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Connecticut-Style Shrimp Rolls", "description": "This speedy seafood dish tucks butter-poached shrimp into warm toasted buns, reminiscent of summer and\u00a0 decadent lobster rolls. The butter sauce is lightly infused with garlic, and a final shower of chives brings mild and fresh onion notes that brighten the rich sauce. Allow the shrimp to simmer in the skillet slowly for the most tender, juicy results. Although chives are a classic choice, dill, parsley, tarragon or basil are all great options.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/20/dining/kc-connecticut-style-shrimp-rolls/merlin_213165084_5403e9e1-10f6-4c10-b14e-f000ed959502-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, main course", "keywords": "chive, quick, sandwiches, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 220}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons", "4 top-split hot dog buns", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 pound large peeled and deveined shrimp\u00a0", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)\u00a0", "\u00bc cup chopped chives", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "\u00a0In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium.
