{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lost-and-Found Lemon Poundcake", "description": "The South has about as many poundcake recipes as there are grandmothers. This one produces a higher, lighter cake than many recipes. It came from Dora Charles\u2019s aunt Laura Daniels, who got it from a nursing-home patient she was working with in the 1970s. The patient,  Mary Martin, mailed it to her long after she left the nursing home, but because of a stroke, her handwriting was shaky. Ms. Charles found the recipe and deciphered it. You can use lemon juice and zest instead of lemon flavoring, which the original recipe called for, or increase the vanilla by a teaspoon if you are leaving out the lemon altogether. The cake, which is a perfect base for peaches and whipped cream or another fruit topping, gets better after a couple of days and will be good for a week if you keep it well wrapped. It freezes well, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/02/dining/02DORAWEB6/02DORAWEB6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "16 to 20 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cake flour, sour cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 302}, "recipeIngredient": ["Baking spray", "1 pound/454 grams good-quality butter", "1 pound/4 cups/460 grams confectioners' sugar", "1 cup sour cream", "2 tablespoons vanilla extract", "1 tablespoon lemon extract, or 1 tablespoon lemon juice plus the finely grated zest of one lemon", "3 cups/360 grams Swans Down or other cake flour", "1/2 teaspoon/4 grams baking soda", "8 large eggs, separated while cold, then brought to room temperature", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
