{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Grilled Pork With Fennel, Cumin and Red Onion", "description": "Imbued with spices that char at high heat, this aromatic pork recipe is a snap to throw together \u2014 exactly what you want for a night of summer grilling. If you\u2019re got wooden skewers, don\u2019t forget to soak them in water for an hour before grilling, so they don\u2019t flare up. And if you\u2019re broiling and you don\u2019t want to bother with skewers at all, just spread the pork cubes out on a rimmed sheet pan, turning them halfway through cooking with tongs or a spatula. The pork is excellent served with pita or crusty bread or a rice pilaf, or simple grilled corn on the cob.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/24/dining/22appe1/merlin_173695626_ffa4ddec-610b-4bb0-a05c-af7acc4bf98d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, main course", "keywords": "boneless pork shoulder, fish sauce, honey, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 966}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "Kosher salt", "1 lime, plus some wedges for serving", "1/4 cup cilantro or basil, leaves and tender stems, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons fish sauce", "2 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 jalape\u00f1o or other green chile, seeded if desired", "1 teaspoon honey", "1 1/2 tablespoons fennel seeds", "1 tablespoon cumin seeds", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "1 small red onion, sliced, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season pork lightly with kosher salt and put it in a bowl or resealable bag."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Juice the lime into a blender or food processor and add cilantro, fish sauce, garlic, jalape\u00f1o and honey.
