{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Apple, Fennel and Onion", "description": "Chicken thighs are roasted with classic fall ingredients for a quick, flavorful sheet-pan supper. The toasted fennel seeds subtly amplify the anise flavor of the roasted fennel and play nicely with the apples and onions. Look for an apple on the tart side as it will naturally sweeten as it cooks in the oven. If you want to use bone-in chicken breasts you can, just make sure to cut the cooking time by a few minutes so they don\u2019t dry out. Serve with a bright, bitter green salad flecked with blue cheese and toasted walnuts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/28/dining/ch-chicken-apple/ch-chicken-apple-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "apple, chicken, fennel, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 335}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 564, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "705 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons fennel seeds", "2 1/2 to 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, patted dry", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 medium fennel bulb, tough outer leaves removed, cored and thinly sliced (about 1 cup)", "1 tart apple, such as Mutsu (Crispin) or Granny Smith, halved, cored and cut into 8 wedges", "4 sprigs rosemary", "Flaky salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
