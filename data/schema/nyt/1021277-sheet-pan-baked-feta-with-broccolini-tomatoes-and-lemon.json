{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Baked Feta With Broccolini, Tomatoes and Lemon", "description": "When baked, feta gains an almost creamy texture, similar to goat cheese but with feta\u2019s characteristic tang. In this easy vegetarian sheet-pan dinner, broccolini (or broccoli), grape tomatoes and lemon slices roast alongside the feta until the broccolini crisp, the tomatoes burst and the lemon rinds soften. (Remember, broccolini has a tender, delicious stalk so only the bottom 1/2-inch needs to be trimmed.) Serve this dish over a pile of orzo for a complete meal. If you like, cut the broccolini, feta and lemon into bite-size pieces and toss with the orzo.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/28/dining/yf-baked-feta/yf-baked-feta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "broccoli, broccolini, cumin, feta, grape tomato, lemon, orzo, red onion, sheet-pan, tomato, fall, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 11208}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch broccolini, ends trimmed, thick stalks split lengthwise, or broccoli, stalks trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces", "1 pint grape tomatoes, halved (about 2 cups)", "1 small red onion, peeled, quartered and cut into 2-inch wedges", "1 lemon, 1/2 cut into thin rounds and the remaining 1/2 left intact, for serving", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 (6- to 8-ounce) blocks feta, cut into 1-inch slices", "Cooked orzo or farro, for serving", "1/2 cup fresh basil or cilantro leaves and fine stems, roughly chopped (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees with a rack set in the lower third.
