{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Doenjang Salmon Rice Bowl", "description": "This speedy meal is for seekers of the sweet-salty, known as dan-jjan in Korean. Doenjang, a glorious Korean fermented soybean paste, anchors the sauce with funk and umami. This sauce, balanced with sweet mirin and tangy rice vinegar, both marinates and lacquers salmon, which is quick-roasted. Cutting the fish into cubes allows more surface area for the salmon fat to render quickly, while the centers cook to a medium-rare, melt-in-your-mouth tenderness, a satisfying contrast to the still-crunchy, just-charred onions. This soul-warming breakfast, lunch or dinner tastes best with white rice, kimchi and whatever other accompaniments you might enjoy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/22/magazine/22mag-eat-site/22mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "doenjang, rice, salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 799}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "4 tablespoons doenjang (see Tip)", "6 tablespoons mirin", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "Salt and black pepper", "1 pound salmon fillets (preferably skinless and center-cut), cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "1 medium yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced", "Steamed rice, for serving", "Kimchi, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk the brown sugar, oil, doenjang, mirin and vinegar until the sugar and doenjang dissolve.
