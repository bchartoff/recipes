{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Earl Grey Madeleines", "description": "C\u00e9dric Grolet, the pastry chef of Le Meurice hotel in Paris, is famous for his Instagram feed, which has nearly a million and a half followers, his tattoos and his title: Best Pastry Chef in the World. Mostly, and most rightly, he\u2019s famous for his elegant pastries, so I was surprised when he asked me if I\u2019d tasted one of his simplest, his madeleines. Small sponge cakes baked in shell-shaped molds (metal pans give you the best color and crust), madeleines are known for the impressive bump that develop on their tops. These madeleines, adapted from a Grolet recipe, are made with brown butter and flavored with Earl Grey tea and honey. Like all madeleines, they benefit from a rest in the refrigerator before they\u2019re baked. (Good for the mads, convenient for the baker.) If you can arrange it, serve the madeleines just minutes out of the oven \u2014 it\u2019s when their fragrance and texture are at their peak.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/08/magazine/08mag-eat/08mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "About 20 madeleines", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "bergamot, cake flour, earl grey tea, honey, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 360}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams cake flour, plus more for dusting", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "3 tablespoons full-flavored honey", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/255 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons), plus more for greasing", "3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon/165 grams granulated sugar", "2 bergamots or Meyer lemons (or 1 lemon and 1 clementine), finely zested", "1 tablespoon loose Earl Grey tea, finely chopped", "3 large eggs plus 1 large egg white, at room temperature", "5 tablespoons/75 milliliters whole milk, slightly warm"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sift together the flour and baking powder.
