{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chickpea Salad With Gim", "description": "The salty, nutty and gloriously savory flavors of gim \u2014 the Korean roasted and seasoned seaweed \u2014 anchor this easy chickpea salad. Packed with umami, sheets of crisp gim are finely chopped into onyx-black confetti, speckling the sesame oil and mayonnaise-bound chickpeas. (Note that Japanese nori, the unseasoned sheets of seaweed used for sushi, are too dry and will not work in this recipe.) As it sits, the salad absorbs the dressing and the raw red onion mellows out beautifully, which means this is an ideal contender for making ahead and lugging to picnics whenever.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/EK-Seaweed-Chickpea-Salad-15SALADSREX/EK-Seaweed-Chickpea-Salad-15SALADSREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "chickpea, gim, mayonnaise, salad, sesame oil, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 115}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "Pinch of granulated sugar", "Salt and black pepper", "1 small red onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)", "20 grams gim (roasted, salted seaweed), finely chopped", "2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To a large bowl, add the mayonnaise, sesame oil, rice vinegar and sugar.
