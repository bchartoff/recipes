{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "French Onion-Braised Lamb Shanks With Barley and Greens", "description": "This warming stew starts with a mountain of lightly caramelized onions and leeks to combine the sweet-savory flavors of French onion soup with rich, red wine-braised lamb shanks. Onion soups can be delicious whether made with lightly caramelized onions or deep, dark, sweet onions, and achieving either is a simple matter of adjusting the cooking time on the onions. Barley and greens added toward the end of cooking make it a complete one-pot meal, though the stew would be equally delicious spooned over polenta or mashed potatoes. (If serving with potatoes or polenta, omit the barley and cook as directed.) Not into lamb (or can\u2019t find shanks)? Try the exact same recipe with beef short ribs or oxtail.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
