Two hours is a long time, but it\u2019s worth it: the pears are transformed, and the syrup, which is not very sweet, is caramelized. The pears will be intact, but they\u2019re so soft you can eat them with a spoon. They also make a nice breakfast with yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/05/business/06recipehealth/06recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "Six servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "dessert, gluten-free, healthy, vegetarian, honey, pear, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 151, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "5 milligrams", "sugarContent": "30 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ripe but firm pears", "2 tablespoons honey", "1/4 cup raw brown (turbinado) sugar or regular brown sugar, preferably organic fair-trade, tightly packed", "12 cloves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
