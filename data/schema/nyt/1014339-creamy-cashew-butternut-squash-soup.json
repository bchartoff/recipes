I was already a fan of butternut squash soup when I was introduced to using cashews as a substitute for cream. This soup is loaded with flavor, fiber and protein. One of my favorite things to do is to ask my guests to figure out the mystery ingredient; nobody ever guesses that I have swapped out the heavy cream for the healthy, raw cashews. This soup is perfect for your vegetarian and vegan guests.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Lerman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/20/science/wellveggiefatdad/wellveggiefatdad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, butternut squash, cashew, spices, fall, gluten-free, kosher, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 663}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "373 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil or unsalted butter", "1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped", "1 cup (150 grams) raw cashews", "1 clove garlic, finely chopped", "1 large butternut squash (about 2 pounds), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice", "5 cups vegetable or chicken stock, plus additional (optional)", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 cup coconut milk, plus additional (optional)", "1 sprig fresh rosemary"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In large stockpot or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering.
