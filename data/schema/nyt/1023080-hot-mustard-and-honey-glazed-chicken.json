{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hot Mustard and Honey Glazed Chicken", "description": "Asian hot mustard powder is a versatile pantry staple that can quickly transform into a spicy sauce, glaze or dressing. Here, the hot mustard is tamed with sweet honey and balanced by fragrant garlic for a savory glaze that caramelizes on chicken when roasted. Once cooked, the chicken receives a final basting for a fresh burst of spicy flavor. Make a double batch of the glaze, as it also tastes great on pork chops and grilled shrimp. Leftover chicken can quickly become a salad the next day; just chop and toss with spinach or romaine and a simple vinaigrette.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/29/dining/kc-hot-mustard-and-honey-glazed-chicken/merlin_202736409_5b4fefb7-a989-4e30-a2b6-a7341541ee51-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, poultry, main course", "keywords": "carrot, chicken legs, honey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1276}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup hot Asian mustard powder (or English dry mustard, such as Colman\u2019s)", "6 tablespoons mild honey, such as clove or acacia", "3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon grated garlic", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 pound carrots, peeled and quartered lengthwise", "1 pound fingerling potatoes, sliced \u00bd-inch thick", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "6 chicken legs (about 3\u00bd pounds), drumsticks and thighs separated", "Chopped scallions or chives, for garnish", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
