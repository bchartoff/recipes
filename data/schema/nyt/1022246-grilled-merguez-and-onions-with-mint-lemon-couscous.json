{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Merguez and Onions With Mint-Lemon Couscous", "description": "In this summery salad, spicy merguez are grilled until seared, then served over a mound of couscous and vegetables that have been seasoned with herbs, cumin and plenty of lemon. Red onions wedges, grilled on one side only, are charred and caramelized in some parts while staying crisp and pungent in others. If you can\u2019t get merguez (which are traditional North African sausages made from lamb, beef or a combination of both), you can substitute any other spicy sausages. Choose something with a bite to contrast with the juicy sweetness of fresh tomatoes and cucumbers. Note that those without grill access can easily use the broiler here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/26/dining/21apperex-merguez/merlin_187777350_75341ba9-34ef-43a4-aa30-a8baa7db667e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, grains and rice, sausages, main course", "keywords": "couscous, merguez sausage, mint, parsley, radish, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 661}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups boiling water", "2 cups couscous (regular or whole wheat)", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt, plus more as needed", "2 lemons", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup thinly sliced radishes", "1 red onion, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch wedges", "8 ounces merguez (lamb or beef)", "1 cup halved cherry tomatoes", "1 cup roughly chopped mint leaves, plus more for garnish", "1 cup roughly chopped parsley leaves and stems, plus more for garnish", "1/2 cup thinly sliced cucumber", "1/4 cup toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the couscous: In a medium, heat-resistant bowl, combine boiling water, couscous and 1 teaspoon salt, and cover with a plate or lid.
