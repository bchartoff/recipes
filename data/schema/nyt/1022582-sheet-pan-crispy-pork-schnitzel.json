{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Crispy Pork Schnitzel\u00a0", "description": "Schnitzel is a way of preparing thin slices of meat by breading and frying them until crisp. While the popular Viennese dish is traditionally made with thinly pounded veal, here, pounded pork cutlets are breaded and baked on a sheet pan \u2014 rather than fried in a skillet \u2014 until golden for an easy weeknight meal. The key to perfectly brown breadcrumbs is the addition of a few dollops of mayonnaise, which helps the coating crisp up during baking. A tangy salad offers fresh and bright notes that balance the rich pork. Look for whole hearts of palm (cylinders rather than sliced) for their firmer texture; the vegetable has a delicate flavor similar to artichokes, with a crunchy-creamy consistency.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/12/dining/kc-sheet-pan-crispy-pork-schnitzel/merlin_195505113_d40306fa-bff8-4047-8760-8ba786599bdb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 Servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "flour, panko, pork", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 947}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing baking sheet", "1/3 cup all-purpose flour", "2 large eggs", "2 teaspoons minced garlic (from about 2 cloves)", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "2 cups panko breadcrumbs\u00a0", "2 (1-inch-thick) boneless pork loin chops (about 1 1/4 pounds total), halved crosswise and pounded to 1/8-inch thickness", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 lemons\u00a0", "1 tablespoon finely chopped capers, plus 1 tablespoon caper brine", "2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley", "1 (14-ounce) can whole hearts of palm, drained, cylinders halved lengthwise and each half thinly sliced on the bias", "1 cup finely chopped celery", "8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
