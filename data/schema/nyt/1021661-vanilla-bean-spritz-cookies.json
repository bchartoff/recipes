{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vanilla Bean Spritz Cookies", "description": "Delicate, buttery and festooned with colored sugar or sprinkles, spritz cookies are a holiday staple. You can make excellent ones without any special items like the vanilla bean paste and cultured butter called for here. But those ingredients will make your cookies even more delicious. You can leave them tasting purely of vanilla, or add another optional flavoring, such as citrus zest, cinnamon or cardamom, or almond extract. These fragile cookies don\u2019t ship well on their own, but you can increase their stability by turning them into sandwich cookies, filled with chocolate, Nutella, or thick jam.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/02/dining/30cookiesrex2-sprtiz/30cookiesrex2-sprtiz-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "brown sugar, butter, christmas cookie, flour, sugar, vanilla bean, christmas, hanukkah", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 534}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), preferably cultured, softened", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/55 grams light brown sugar", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste (or use 1 tablespoon vanilla extract)", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest or orange zest, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon or cardamom, or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional)", "2 1/4 cups/290 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Decorative sugar, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
