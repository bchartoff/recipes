{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple-Pecan Bourbon Balls", "description": "The bourbon ball was created in 1938 by Ruth Hanly Booe, a former Kentucky school teacher turned candy maker. The creamy original was whisky-spiked, covered with chocolate and topped with a pecan. Modern-day versions, like this one, are simpler to put together: Vanilla wafers, toasted pecans, cocoa powder, confectioners' sugar and bourbon are combined in a food processor, rolled into balls and dunked in melted chocolate or rolled in confectioners' sugar. Ours also includes a bit of maple syrup for added depth. Bar chocolate, as opposed to chocolate chips, works much better for enrobing candies because chocolate chips have less cocoa butter and become too thick to coat evenly when melted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/dining/ss-bourbon-balls/ss-bourbon-balls-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 2 1/2 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "candies", "keywords": "bourbon, maple syrup, pecan, vanilla wafers, dessert, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 171}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 123, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "56 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces/225 grams vanilla wafers", "1 1/4 cups/125 grams pecan halves, toasted", "6 tablespoons/90 milliliters maple syrup", "1/3 cup/30 grams cocoa powder", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters bourbon", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus about 1/4 cup/30 grams for coating (optional)", "1 1/2 cups/255 grams chopped semisweet chocolate (not chips)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, combine the vanilla wafers and pecans and process until fine crumbs form.
