{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Escarole Salad With Anchovy Croutons", "description": "Think of this salad as an umami-charged version of a classic Caesar. The central difference is that the egg yolk, which is typically emulsified into a creamy dressing, is plopped directly onto the lettuces, leaving you to break it and let it mingle with the salty, garlicky, lemony dressing, which is bolstered with a bit of soy sauce. (If the whole, raw egg yolks freak you out, swap them for jammy soft-boiled eggs or crispy fried eggs.) The true reason to make this salad, though, is that it\u2019s adorned with chicken-fat-laced anchovy croutons, made in the oven while the chicken finishes cooking. They are worth the price of admission.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/dining/15Romanrex/merlin_152005611_30054f65-d1f3-4dc8-bb61-5bfdc58f0ecc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry, salads and dressings", "keywords": "anchovy, chicken, crusty bread, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 178}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 544, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "981 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts or thighs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "4 anchovy fillets, plus more if you like", "1/4 loaf of crusty bread, torn into 1-inch pieces (about 2 cups)", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 large head escarole or 2 heads romaine lettuce, torn into large pieces", "1 cup parsley, tender leaves and stems", "Pecorino or Parmesan, for shaving", "4 large egg yolks (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
