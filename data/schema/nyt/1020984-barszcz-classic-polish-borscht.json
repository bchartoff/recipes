{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Barszcz (Classic Polish Borscht)", "description": "Most Slavic countries have their own form of beet soup, a winter staple across Central and Eastern Europe. Barszcz, the Polish variation, is usually served as a clear burgundy broth with bright, wintry flavors. It is sweeter and beefier than Ukrainian or Russian borscht, and much less textural: Most vegetables are strained after imparting their flavor, though the soup may include grated beets or morsels of meat. This recipe is adapted from \u201cFrom a Polish Country House Kitchen,\u201d an anthropological cookbook by Anne Applebaum and Danielle Crittenden (Chronicle Books, 2012). Strain the vegetables entirely and sip the restorative broth directly from a mug, or serve the soup with sour cream and enjoy with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020983-pierogi-ruskie-potatoes-cheese-and-caramelized-onions\">pierogi</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amelia Nierenberg"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/22/dining/21milkbarrex1/merlin_171379617_f3e02036-1bf7-4b86-ae3a-802b2eaa897d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 cups (6 to 8 appetizer or side servings)", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, soups and stews, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "beef bones, beet, carrot, dried mushroom, leek, sour cream, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 109}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 medium beets (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled \u2014 3 beets quartered and 3 beets left whole", "1 1/2 pounds fresh or frozen beef shank bones, or other veal or beef bones", "2 medium carrots, peeled", "1 medium parsnip, peeled", "1 large white or yellow onion, peeled and quartered", "1 large leek, trimmed, halved lengthwise and crosswise, then rinsed", "1 large celery stalk, halved crosswise", "8 large garlic cloves, peeled", "3 large fresh or dried bay leaves", "6 dried porcini mushrooms (optional)", "2 teaspoons black peppercorns (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram (optional)", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 to 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "Sour cream, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, combine the beets, bones, carrots, parsnip, onion, leek, celery, garlic and bay leaves, plus the mushrooms, peppercorns and marjoram, if using.
