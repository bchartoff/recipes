{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Yaki Onigiri (Grilled Japanese Rice Balls) With Pickled Shiitakes", "description": "Onigiri, also known as omusube, are portable snacks, often sold in Japanese convenience stores, which are traditionally stuffed with salty, tangy fillings, then wrapped in seaweed. When grilled, glazed or cooked, they become yaki onigiri. In this version, adapted from \u201cVegan JapanEasy: Classic and Modern Vegan Japanese Recipes to Cook at Home\u201d by Tim Anderson (Hardie Grant, 2020), a little bit of the pickled shiitake filling goes a long way. (The recipe makes extra, which you can keep refrigerated to add to stir-fries, ramen or even omelets.) You could also stuff these with finely chopped kimchi, Japanese pickles, saut\u00e9ed greens or nothing at all. Available online or at most Japanese supermarkets, an onigiri mold makes for sleek shaping, but, with a little practice, you could also form the shape by hand, or simply roll the rice between your palms into balls. For hot yaki onigiri, brush them with the miso glaze, which will form a delightful crackly, caramelized crust when broiled.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/22/dining/22Cookbook-Onigiri/22Cookbook-Onigiri-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 12 onigiri (2 to 4 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, finger foods, grains and rice, project, vegetables, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, mirin, miso, miso paste, rice, rice vinegar, shiitake, soy sauce, sushi rice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 355}, "recipeIngredient": ["24 dried shiitake mushrooms", "1/2 teaspoon Japanese chile flakes, or a pinch of cayenne or red-pepper flakes", "3/4 cup tamari or soy sauce (preferably low sodium)", "1/2 cup mirin", "3 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 1/2 cups sushi rice (Japanese short-grain rice)", "Neutral oil, for brushing", "Sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)", "1 sheet of nori, cut into small rectangles (optional)", "2 tablespoons red or white miso", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "2 teaspoons mirin", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons sake or water", "1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar, lime juice or other vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the filling, if using: Add the shiitakes to a medium saucepan and top with cold water by a couple of inches.
