Place on a large sheet of aluminum foil or in a small casserole with a lid. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Wrap up the foil into a tight package or cover the dish and roast until the garlic is soft, about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, peel the garlic by squeezing each clove at one end so that it pops out of the skin."}]}
