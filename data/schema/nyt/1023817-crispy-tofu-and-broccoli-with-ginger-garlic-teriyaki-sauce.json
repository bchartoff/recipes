{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Tofu and Broccoli With Ginger-Garlic Teriyaki Sauce", "description": "Crispy tofu is attainable without frying. In this mostly hands-off recipe, firm tofu is dredged in cornstarch (one of our pantry\u2019s most versatile staples) before being baked at high temperature. The tofu becomes golden, with an enviable crunch that stays crisp even when drizzled with teriyaki sauce. Traditional teriyaki sauce contains just four ingredients \u2014 soy sauce, mirin, sake and sugar \u2014 but this one also has ginger and garlic, which add a bit more punch. In Japanese cuisine, teriyaki refers to any grilled, broiled or pan-fried food with a shiny glaze. No cornstarch is needed to make a true teriyaki sauce glisten; just cook it down until it looks shiny underneath the brown foam, but make sure not to overcook as it thickens considerably as it cools.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/09/multimedia/hm-crispy-tofu-and-broccoli-ghkp/hm-crispy-tofu-and-broccoli-ghkp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, beans, main course", "keywords": "broccoli, cornstarch, extra-firm tofu, fresh ginger, garlic, mirin, sake, soy sauce, sugar, tamari, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1061}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (14-ounce) package extra firm tofu, drained\u00a0", "Neutral oil\u00a0", "3/4 cup cornstarch", "Kosher salt (such Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 pound broccoli, cut into small 1-inch florets, stems reserved for another use", "Chopped cilantro leaves, for topping (optional)", "Toasted white sesame seeds, for topping (optional)", "Cooked rice, for serving", "1/2 cup soy sauce or tamari", "1/2 cup mirin", "1/3 cup sake", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "1-inch piece ginger, peeled and grated", "1 garlic clove, peeled and grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange racks in the middle and bottom of the oven, and heat the oven to 425 degrees.
