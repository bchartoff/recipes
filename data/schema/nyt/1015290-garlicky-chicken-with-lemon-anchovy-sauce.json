{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlicky Chicken With Lemon-Anchovy Sauce", "description": "There\u2019s nothing wrong with a dinner of pan-seared chicken seasoned with salt and pepper. But there\u2019s everything right about the same chicken when you add anchovies, capers, garlic and plenty of lemon to the pan. What was once timid and a little dull turns vibrant, tangy and impossible to stop eating. And the only real extra work is chopping the garlic and a little parsley for garnish. In this dish, the cut of chicken is less important than the pungent pan sauce. Most people will probably want to use the workhorse of all poultry dinners, the boneless, skinless breasts. But the thighs cook nearly as quickly, and have a greater margin of error in terms of doneness. Overcook your breasts by even a minute, and you\u2019ll get dry, tough meat. Thighs are more forgiving. However, if your family insists on white meat, you can substitute breasts and subtract about 3 minutes from the cooking time. There is no need to mention the anchovies until after people have complimented you on the meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/02/dining/mc-chicken-with-lemon-anchovy-sauce/mc-chicken-with-lemon-anchovy-sauce-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight", "keywords": "anchovies, chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3806}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 407, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "45 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "604 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (4 to 5 thighs)", "1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "5 anchovy fillets", "2 tablespoons drained capers, patted dry", "1 large pinch chile flakes", "1 lemon, halved", "Fresh chopped parsley, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
