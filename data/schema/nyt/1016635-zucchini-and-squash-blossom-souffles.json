Be sure to have your guests seated at the table before serving. The souffl\u00e9s will rise nicely, but they do fall rather quickly.\nIf you have a zucchini patch, you\u2019re all set for this recipe; otherwise get just-picked squash at the farmers market. It should have shiny smooth skin. Choose zucchini that is small but not tiny (so-called baby squash can be bitter).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/09/dining/09KITCH1/09KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 small souffl\u00e9s", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "squash blossoms, zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 211, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "497 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing ramekins", "1/4 cup flour", "1 1/2 cups whole milk or half-and-half, more as needed", "1 thyme sprig", "1 bay leaf", "Salt and pepper", "Pinch of cayenne", "A little freshly grated nutmeg", "2 pounds small fresh zucchini, coarsely grated, about 4 cups", "4 large eggs, separated", "1 small green serrano chile, finely chopped (optional)", "4 ounces Emmentaler or Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated, or a mixture with 1/4-part Parmesan", "1 tablespoon finely cut chives", "2 tablespoons rough-chopped basil", "6 to 8 squash blossoms, tough part removed, torn into 1/2-inch strips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butter ramekins well and set aside.
