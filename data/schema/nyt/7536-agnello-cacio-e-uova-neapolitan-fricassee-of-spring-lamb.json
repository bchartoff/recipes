Keep the casserole on low heat, so that the juices are barely simmering. Beat the eggs well and mix in the parmigiano. Add a ladleful of the meat juices to the eggs, beating well as you drizzle it in. Continue beating in the meat juices until the egg mixture is warm. Then carefully beat the egg mixture into the juices in the casserole. Continue beating over very low heat until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon. Do not let the sauce come to a boil because that will scramble the eggs.
