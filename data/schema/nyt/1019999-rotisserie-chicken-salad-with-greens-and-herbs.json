It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nPick up a heat-lamp roast chicken at the market on the way home \u2014 it\u2019s O.K.! \u2014 and tear it apart to feed four, or half of it for two, shredding the meat with your fingers. Mix the chicken with a few handfuls of baby arugula, a large handful of sliced scallions and a lot of chopped cilantro. Cut an avocado or two into the mix if you have them on hand. Then make a dressing out of lime juice \u2014 one juicy squeezed lime will do \u2014 a pressed garlic clove and a few glugs of olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper. Drizzle that over the top and serve. Dinner in 15 minutes, tops.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17norecipe-rotisseriechickensalad/17norecipe-rotisseriechickensalad-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry, salads and dressings", "keywords": "arugula, avocado, rotisserie chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 452}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
