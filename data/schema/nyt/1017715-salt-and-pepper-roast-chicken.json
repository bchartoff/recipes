{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salt-and-Pepper Roast Chicken", "description": "Calling for just four ingredients \u2013 chicken, salt, pepper and whatever herbs you have around \u2013 this is a recipe for roast chicken at its simplest and best. The method is fairly straightforward. You season the bird, then roast it at high heat until the skin is bronzed and crisp and the flesh juicy. If you have time to season the chicken ahead, you should; it makes a difference in  flavor. And bear in mind, if you have the kind of oven that starts smoking at high heat, you can cook your bird at 400 degrees instead of 450, though you\u2019ll need an extra 5 to 20 minutes to get it done.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/25/dining/18clark-roast-chicken/clark-roast-chicken-mediumThreeByTwo440-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weeknight", "keywords": "chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1201}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 587, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "933 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 1/2-pound) whole chicken, patted dry", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons black pepper", "Small bunch mixed herbs, such as rosemary, thyme and sage"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper.
