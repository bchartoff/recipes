{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlic Shrimp Brochettes", "description": "This garlicky green sauce is a good match for shrimp, which are threaded onto skewers and grilled \u2014 preferably outdoors, over hot coals, though this recipe also works fine on a stovetop in a cast-iron pan, or under the broiler. The resulting brochettes, which are small (about 2 ounces each), are perfect party food. Threading each piece of meat onto two skewers, rather than one, keeps the meat from twirling and makes it easier to grill. (If you\u2019re using bamboo skewers, soak them in warm water for 15 minutes, so they won\u2019t catch fire.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/19/dining/shrimpbrochette/shrimpbrochette-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 skewers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, skewers and kebabs", "keywords": "basil, garlic, parsley, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 72}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 287, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "326 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large shrimp (preferably wild), peeled and deveined", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more for seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper, more for seasoning", "6 garlic cloves, smashed to a paste", "1 cup basil leaves, loosely packed", "1 cup parsley leaves, loosely packed", "1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper", "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "1 cup olive oil", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season shrimp lightly on both sides with salt and pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To skewer, lay shrimp flat on cutting board.
