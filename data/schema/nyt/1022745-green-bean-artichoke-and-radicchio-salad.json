{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Bean, Artichoke and Radicchio Salad", "description": "Snappy cooked green beans make for a gorgeous salad with radicchio and canned artichokes. Beyond the vegetables, all you need for this refreshing zinger of a side dish is a generous glug of olive oil, a heavy hand with salt and pepper, and an electric spritz of lemon. A sprinkle of dried oregano on top lends bottled Italian dressing vibes, but with a homemade taste. This is an excellent addition to Thanksgiving, as it lets you feed two birds with one scone: You get a green bean moment and a salad moment all at once. To prepare this in advance, assemble everything through Step 2, keep it covered in the refrigerator, then on Thanksgiving Day, proceed with the dressing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15BEGINNERREX4-SALAD/15BEGINNERREX4-SALAD-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, side dish", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, green beans, radicchio, salad, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 276}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces green beans", "Salt", "1 head radicchio", "1 (14-ounce) can artichoke hearts", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 lemon, halved", "Pinch of dried oregano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Snap the tough stem ends off the green beans, then cut into 2-inch pieces or in halves.
