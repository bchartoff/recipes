{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Fish With Creamed Kale and Leeks", "description": "This satisfying weeknight meal involves three simple components \u2014 fish, kale and rice \u2014 and builds flavor from just one versatile element requiring a little labor: leek-infused cream. Saut\u00e9 leeks, garlic and thyme in butter until softened, then simmer with heavy cream until thickened. Strain the mixture, saving the leeks to add flavor to cooked rice, polenta or pearl couscous, then combine the fragrant cream with blanched kale and a little mustard. Season the skin of your fillets early to help them develop a particularly crisp, crackly crust. If you can\u2019t find fresh char, any mild fish fillets will work well in their place.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/04/dining/aw-seared-char-with-creamed-greens-and-leeks/merlin_183049518_41ed1d2c-bb63-4b74-8b72-526e69b73499-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, main course", "keywords": "char, fish, kale, leeks, thyme", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 311}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (5- to 6-ounce) Arctic char or other mild fish fillets, such as salmon", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds curly kale", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large leek (about 1/2 pound), trimmed, white and pale greens quartered lengthwise then thinly sliced", "6 large fresh thyme sprigs", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon chicken or vegetable stock concentrate, like Better Than Bouillion", "Cooked white rice or pearl couscous, warmed, for serving", "2 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare your fish: Pat the fish dry, then salt the skin side to help draw out moisture.
