{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Pork Dip", "description": "This roast pork dip sandwich, with shredded meat slathered in a rich roux-based dipping sauce, comes from Brian Landry, the chef and an owner of Borgne Restaurant in New Orleans. Pork butt, pierced with garlic slivers and rubbed with fresh rosemary, is slow-roasted until meltingly tender on a bed of vegetables that flavor the final sauce. The meat can be made ahead and then reheated before it is tucked into a crusty roll, a delicious tweak on the po\u2019 boy. \u201cThey say the sign of a good po\u2019 boy is how many napkins it takes to get through a sandwich,\u201d Mr. Landry said. \u201cThis one takes a lot of napkins.\u201d At Borgne he garnishes it with crispy fried onions, Tabasco-enhanced mayonnaise and melted Swiss cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Suzanne Lenzer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/23/dining/23SUPERBOWL3_SPAN/23SUPERBOWL3_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "creole", "recipeCategory": "lunch, sandwiches, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "baguette, chicken stock, pork butt, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 49}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 141, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "394 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bone-in pork butt (approximately 5 to 7 pounds)", "1 head garlic, broken into individual cloves and peeled", "Kosher salt", "Black pepper", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme, finely chopped, plus 1 teaspoon leaves", "2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, finely chopped", "3 celery stalks, roughly chopped", "1 carrot, roughly chopped", "1 onion, roughly chopped", "2 fresh bay leaves", "4 cups chicken stock", "1 cup white wine", "1/2 cup crushed tomatoes", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "Crusty rolls or baguette"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
