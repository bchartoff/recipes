Here, the dressing, thinned out and lightened with yogurt, is spiced with curry and cumin, and the salad mix includes a generous amount of chopped radicchio or endive, which bring a bitter dimension into the mix. This salad is also an excellent home for leftover Thanksgiving turkey.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/26/dining/26MARTHA1/26MARTHA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "apple, celery, radicchio, turkey, fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, low-sodium, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 76}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 253, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "360 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1/4 cup plain yogurt", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "1/2 teaspoon lightly toasted cumin seeds, ground", "1/2 teaspoon honey", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons walnut oil or grapeseed oil, or 1 tablespoon each", "2 cups diced or shredded turkey", "1 tart apple, such as a Granny Smiith, diced", "1 1/2 cups diced celery", "1/4 cup raisins", "1/3 cup chopped walnuts", "2 cups chopped radicchio or endive"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl or measuring cup, whisk together mayonnaise, yogurt, curry powder, cumin, honey, lemon juice, salt and oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large salad bowl combine turkey, apples, celery, raisins, walnuts and radicchio or endive.
