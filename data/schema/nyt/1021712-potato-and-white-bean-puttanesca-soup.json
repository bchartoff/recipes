{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato and White Bean Puttanesca Soup", "description": "Potatoes and cannellini beans provide the bulk in this hearty soup inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11583-pasta-puttanesca\">pasta puttanesca</a>, while the garlicky tomato base is imbued with the briny punch of capers and black olives. The signature of puttanesca is heat, so adjust the amount of red-pepper flakes to your liking or use fresh chiles, if you have them. Reserve some of the olives and capers, and combine with parsley to make a topper that amplifies the sharp, bright flavors. Haphazardly mashing some of the beans and potatoes is an efficient way to thicken the soup, without the need for any additional equipment. In fact, it\u2019s a great trick to have up your sleeve whenever you are looking to thicken soups or stews.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/27/dining/hm-potato-bean/merlin_179866767_927c0393-f997-44ea-9e36-a2698892b9bb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews, vegetables, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "cannellini beans, olives, parsley, potato, tomato, fall, winter, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1796}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 medium onion, finely diced (about 2 cups)", "1/2 cup black olives, roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons capers, roughly chopped", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 1/2 pound Yukon gold or red potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or more to taste", "3 cups vegetable stock", "1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves and tender stems (or fresh basil leaves)", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
