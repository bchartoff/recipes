It requires no kneading. It uses no special ingredients, equipment or techniques. And it takes very little effort \u2014 only time. You will need 24 hours to create the bread, but much of this is unattended waiting, a slow fermentation of the dough that results in a perfect loaf.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/05/dining/mb-no-knead-bread/mb-no-knead-bread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "One 1 1/2-pound loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, breads, times classics", "keywords": "side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8760}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, more for dusting", "1/4 teaspoon instant yeast", "1 1/4 teaspoons salt", "Cornmeal or wheat bran as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt.

Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours.

Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack."}], "video": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No-Knead Bread", "description": "Mark Bittman demonstrates how to make no-knead bread.", "thumbnailUrl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/05/dining/mb-no-knead-bread/mb-no-knead-bread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "uploadDate": "2006-11-08T00:03:57.000Z", "duration": "PT4M50S"}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread"}
