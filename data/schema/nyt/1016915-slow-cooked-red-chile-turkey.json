{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooked Red Chile Turkey", "description": "Anyone who has spent time in New Mexico knows that fiery red chile sauce, made with local dried chiles, finds its way into most meals there, enhancing plates of huevos rancheros or enchiladas. But just as often, it is the base for a meat stew, usually beef, pork or lamb. The dish is known as carne adovada, and it is insanely good.\nYes, there probably is a roasted turkey in most homes for Thanksgiving, and maybe a steaming pot of tamales. But the thought occurred to me that turkey thighs (the tastiest part of the bird) simmered in red chile would be a welcome substitute. It turns out I was right. Slowly braised for 2 hours, this spicy turkey is succulent and tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19NEWMEXICO/19NEWMEXICO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "garlic, new mexico chiles, turkey thighs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 128}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 370, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "45 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "722 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large turkey thighs, about 6 pounds", "Salt and pepper", "6 ounces dried New Mexico chiles, about 24 large pods", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 large onion, finely diced", "1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds, toasted and ground", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground", "8 garlic cloves, minced", "1 bay leaf", "Cilantro sprigs (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season turkey generously with salt and pepper, then set aside at room temperature."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
