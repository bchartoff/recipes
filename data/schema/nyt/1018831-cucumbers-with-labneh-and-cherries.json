{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cucumbers With Labneh and Cherries", "description": "This recipe comes from Kismet, the chef Sara Kramer's restaurant in Los Angeles. There, the labneh is made in-house, providing an advantage that can never quite be overcome at home. Still, buy the best labneh you can find. This recipe calls for cherries, but any stone fruit can work: apricots, peaches, plums, nectarines. The slight pickle intensifies the fresh fruit, the taste of summer. The Persian cucumbers can be cut on the bias, as specified here, or sliced thinly on a mandoline.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Oliver Strand"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/12/dining/12CHEF3/12CHEF3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, dips and spreads, pickles", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, labneh, persian cucumber, rose water, sweet cherries, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 47}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 272, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "936 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups sweet cherries, halved and pitted", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons raw sesame seeds, ground", "1 tablespoon whole toasted sesame seeds", "3/4 cup dried rose petals, roughly ground", "1 1/2 teaspoons sumac", "1 teaspoon parsley seeds, ground, or toasted crushed fennel seeds", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "2 cups labneh", "1 teaspoon salt", "Zest of 2 lemons", "2 cloves garlic, grated on a Microplane", "1 tablespoon rose water", "2 teaspoons honey", "Black pepper, to taste", "9 to 12 Persian cucumbers, rinsed and cut on the bias into 1/2-inch slices", "Juice of 2 lemons", "Olive oil", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cherries: Place the cherries in a bowl and add vinegar, sugar and salt.
