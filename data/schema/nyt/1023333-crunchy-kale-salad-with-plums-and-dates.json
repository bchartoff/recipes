{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy Kale Salad With Plums and Dates", "description": "Kale salad has passed whatever nebulous test there is of food fads and become a mainstay, especially in the fall, but it\u2019s ideal for summer, too, because it doesn\u2019t wilt in the heat. If anything, you want to be sure to crush the finely sliced greens until they\u2019re droopy. Kale salad can feel like a chore to chew if the greens aren\u2019t softened sufficiently, so massage them into submission. To add a welcome, easy crunch to the tender leaves, this salad is littered with roasted, salted sunflower seeds. They\u2019re a savory contrast to tangy wedges of juicy plums and chewy, sweet dates in the lemony mix that holds up well on any picnic table and for up to 3 days in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/GK-Kale-With-Plums-and-Dates-15SALADREX/merlin_209704512_8007be6a-1ee2-4206-9ccb-b9fc7f2a36b7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "dates, kale, plum, pluots, sunflower seeds, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large bunch kale (1 pound), stems discarded, leaves finely sliced", "1 lemon", "Salt and black pepper", "8 pitted dates", "3 ripe but firm plums or pluots", "1/2 cup roasted salted sunflower seeds", "1/4 cup roasted walnut oil or olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the kale in a large bowl and finely grate the lemon zest directly over the greens.
