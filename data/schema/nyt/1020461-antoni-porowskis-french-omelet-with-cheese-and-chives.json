On Netflix\u2019s \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d Antoni Porowski, the food-focused member of the Fab 5, teaches the people he helps make over how to nourish themselves in an accessible way. This simple but sophisticated recipe, adapted from his cookbook, \u201cAntoni in the Kitchen,\u201d follows in that vein. It requires few ingredients and a dextrous hand: You\u2019ll want to consider your ingredients carefully, and take care to not overmix the eggs. Keep it simple, or add mix-ins. Serve it alone, or pair it, as he suggests, with a favorite salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/dining/ap-omelet/ap-omelet-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, for one, weekday", "keywords": "butter, chives, eggs, gruy\u00e8re, pepper, salt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large eggs", "2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, preferably European-style or cultured", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1/3 cup coarsely grated Gruy\u00e8re, sharp Cheddar or Fontina", "Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon or kosher salt", "Black pepper", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk eggs in a medium bowl until well combined and smooth, taking care not to whip in too much air.
