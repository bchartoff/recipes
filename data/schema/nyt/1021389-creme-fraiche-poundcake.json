{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche Poundcake", "description": "Old-fashioned poundcake recipes don\u2019t typically contain any chemical leavening, relying on the power of eggs and elbow grease to raise the crumb. Modern recipes often mix in a little baking powder or soda to lighten things up \u2014 but how much can be up to the cook. Adding 1/2 teaspoon baking powder will give the cake a dense and velvety interior; using the whole teaspoon makes it slightly airier and softer. Either way, this buttery loaf cake has a gentle tang from the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, which is also featured in the candylike glaze. You\u2019ll need a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan to accommodate all the batter. If your loaf pan is smaller, bake any extra batter in a greased ramekin on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/26/dining/21apperex/merlin_175613250_8228bb1a-68cb-44dd-8752-4fb497175f7d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, quick breads, dessert", "keywords": "butter, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, egg", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1087}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar, plus more for coating the pan", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 tablespoons/10 grams cornstarch", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "4 eggs, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (or sour cream), at room temperature", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract or dark rum", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract or dark rum", "2 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
