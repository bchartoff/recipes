{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Stew Pork Shoulder", "description": "In the Caribbean, brown stew is a staple and this recipe showcases why it's a classic West Indian comfort food. The name comes from the dark hue, usually attained through the burned sugar essence, or browning, at its base. Here, the chef Ricky Moore of <a href=\"https://www.saltboxseafoodjoint.com/\">Saltbox Seafood Joint</a>, in Durham, N.C., achieves the deep rich color from the inclusion of Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. The slow-simmered pork shoulder acquires complexity from sweet allspice, woodsy thyme and the fruity fire of Scotch bonnet. Lively bursts of pungency from the addition of ketchup and apple cider vinegar, plus pockets of sweetness from carrots and bell peppers complete this rich, well-rounded stew.
