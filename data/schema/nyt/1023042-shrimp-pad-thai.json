The savory, tart sauce is very simple to assemble, and it lasts well in the fridge. Watcharee Limanon, a cooking teacher in Yarmouth, Maine, who shared this recipe, said that although salty dried shrimp are used in the original recipe, many Thai cooks (and most of her students) now prefer fresh shrimp.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/17padthairex1/merlin_203116326_32624565-ffae-482d-9a55-043cf31afb0b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "noodles, main course", "keywords": "egg, rice noodles, shrimp, tofu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1018}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces sen lek (dried 1/8-inch-wide flat rice noodles\u200b) or other pad Thai noodles", "1/4 cup minced garlic", "2 tablespoons minced shallot", "1/4 cup minced Thai sweet preserved radish (optional; see Tip)", "10 to 12 peeled and deveined medium shrimp", "8 ounces superfirm (pressed) tofu, cut into bite-size cubes or rectangles (1 cup)", "4 large eggs, lightly beaten", "2 cups bean sprouts", "1 small bunch garlic chives or scallion greens, cut into 1-inch lengths (1/2 cup)", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for cooking eggs", "Chopped peanuts, chile powder and lime wedges, for serving", "1/3 cup fish sauce", "1/3 cup tamarind liquid or concentrate", "1/3 cup coconut or other palm sugar or dark brown sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the noodles: Place dried noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot tap water.
