{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken With Fried Basil", "description": "This spiced fried chicken is a staple in the night markets of Taiwan. You can order the chicken in cutlet form or small bites like these, which are served in paper bags with wooden skewers. This recipe uses a few spices that cannot be skipped: five-spice powder and white pepper. The Sichuan peppercorns are a bonus, adding a little numbing tingle. If you can\u2019t find Sichuan peppercorns, use black peppercorns instead. You won\u2019t get the same tingly feeling, but the chicken will be just as good. This fried chicken recipe happens to be gluten-free thanks to the tapioca flour, which imparts the dish\u2019s signature crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/dining/sl-taiwanese-fried-chicken/merlin_179866965_dae18691-ff16-4d53-8d55-965933bbaa5b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, finger foods, poultry, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "basil, boneless chicken thighs, chicken, sichuan peppercorns, soy sauce, white pepper", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1399}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder", "1 teaspoon ground white pepper", "4 teaspoons kosher salt", "6 cups vegetable oil", "1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns or whole black peppercorns", "1 cup/115 grams tapioca flour", "1 cup fresh basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, season chicken thighs with soy sauce, sugar, five-spice powder, white pepper and 2 teaspoons salt.
