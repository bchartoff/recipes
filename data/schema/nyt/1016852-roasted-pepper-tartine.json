Like a piece of pizza, a tartine is constructed from a thick slice of rustic bread, lightly toasted. A savory topping and some good French cheese precede a few minutes of browning under the broiler. This tartine features garlicky roasted pepper strips (fresh or from a jar), a dab of sundried tomato pur\u00e9e (sliced fresh tomatoes in summer) and black olives. A thick slice of goat cheese makes a perfect pairing, or use Camembert if you prefer. Make a green salad to serve alongside for a quick light meal, or you may cut the tartine into small wedges to serve with drinks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/08/dining/08KITCH2/08KITCH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, sandwiches", "keywords": "bread, goat cheese, olive, red bell pepper, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 122}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 roasted red or yellow bell peppers (good-quality jarred peppers are fine)", "Salt and pepper", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram or 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 large 1/2-inch-thick slices bread from a day-old rustic loaf, such as miche or pain au levain (about 6 by 4 inches)", "4 tablespoons sun-dried tomato pur\u00e9e (optional)", "12 black olives, pitted", "4 ounces firm fresh goat cheese log or 4 ounces Camembert"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove and discard seeds from peppers, then slice peppers into strips 1/4-inch wide.
