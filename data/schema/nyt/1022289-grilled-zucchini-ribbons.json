We love it for its summery flavor and sheer abundance. We love it less for its unfortunate tendency to become soggy when grilled. Russ Faulk, chief designer at Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet and author of \u201cFood + Fire,\u201d has come up with an ingenious method of keeping zucchini crisp during grilling: He slices it thin on a mandolin, then accordions the strips on skewers to grill over a screaming hot fire. The edges char and crisp, giving you the vegetable equivalent of meaty ribs\u2019 burnt ends. I\u2019ve taken the burnt end idea one step further by seasoning the zucchini with a classic barbecue rub \u2014 use your favorite \u2014 and basting it with spiced butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/16/dining/15vegetablesrex3-zucchini/merlin_188862222_b6d59ec5-4b53-4426-8b2a-0cf36432efe5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "barbecue rub, butter, zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 543}, "recipeIngredient": ["Vegetable oil, for the grill grates", "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil", "1 garlic clove, minced", "3 tablespoons barbecue rub or spice mix", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "6 medium-small zucchini (6 ounces each)", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set up your grill for direct grilling and heat to high (450 to 600 degrees).
