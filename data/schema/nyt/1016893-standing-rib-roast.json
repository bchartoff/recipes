Thanksgiving is no exception. When Ms. Belieu, a fourth-generation Nebraskan, was growing up in Omaha, her family served prime rib alongside the turkey \u2014 until they realized no one really liked the bird and dispensed with it altogether. Her grandfather was a cowboy, and the whole family was steeped in the state\u2019s ranching culture, even when they eventually moved to the city.\nIn her house, the beef was minimally seasoned and roasted in a hot oven until the exterior was crackling and browned, the inside juicy and red. A little horseradish sauce might be served on the side, but her father always disapproved. Good beef doesn\u2019t need it. \u201cHe thought sauce was for drugstore cowboys,\u201d she said.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19NEBRASKA/19NEBRASKA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "beef, garlic, rib roast, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 612}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 730, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "63 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "sodiumContent": "527 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (4 rib) standing rib roast, 7 to 8 pounds", "1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 cup minced herbs (optional)", "4 garlic cloves, mashed to a paste (optional)", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika (optional)", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat meat all over with paper towels, then season it all over with salt and pepper.
