{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut-Braised Chicken With Potatoes", "description": "This chicken and potato dish is a low-effort, one-pot weeknight dinner inspired by the rich, warming aroma of Indian curries and the slow cooking style of Moroccan tagines. Like many tagines, this recipe calls for first simmering the chicken gently, covered, then cooks it further, uncovered, to reduce the liquid and concentrate its flavors. Though the meal takes time to cook, set a timer and it becomes a set-it-and-pretty-much-forget-it situation. Chicken parts are braised in coconut milk laced with cumin, turmeric and fresh ginger until tender and falling off the bone, making this dish a comforting, cozy meal for any time of year. Serve with rice or bread to soak up the flavorful liquid. You can mix baby spinach into leftovers the next day to keep it feeling new.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/28/dining/yf-coconut-braised-chicken-with-potatoes/merlin_215517759_aac63c00-a79d-417a-aa27-9bc6d0ac2a9b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, one pot, main course", "keywords": "chicken drumstick, chicken thigh, coconut milk, dutch oven, fresh ginger, ground cumin, ground turmeric, lime juice, lime zest, new potato, stew", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 396}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (13-ounce) can unsweetened full-fat coconut milk", "4 teaspoons minced or grated fresh ginger (from a 1 1/2-inch piece)", "2 limes, 1 zested and juiced (about 1/2 teaspoon and 1 tablespoon) and 1 halved", "1 tablespoon ground turmeric\u00a0", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "Kosher salt\u00a0", "1 1/2 pounds small (about 3/4-inch) yellow baby potatoes (larger ones halved)\u00a0", "2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts, thighs or drumsticks, excess fat and skin trimmed", "1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped or torn", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "White rice or bread (such as naan or pita), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or lidded oven-proof pot, add the coconut milk, ginger, lime zest and juice, turmeric, cumin, red-pepper flakes, peppercorns and 2 teaspoons salt; stir using a fork to dissolve any coconut clumps.
