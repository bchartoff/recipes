We put it in The Times in 1992. Pat makes this delicious fresh apple yogurt coffee cake using regular flour. The yogurt's acidity tenderizes the gluten, and the results are excellent, if on the pudding-cake side of cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Marian Burros"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "15 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday", "keywords": "apple, yogurt, dessert, low calorie, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 83}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 132, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "106 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 cup sugar", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon mace or nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon grated orange rind", "1 1/2 cups nonfat plain yogurt", "1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup nonfat milk", "1/4 cup nonfat milk", "1 large apple, peeled and coarsely chopped", "2 to 3 teaspoons vanilla extract", "Oil to grease the pan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sift flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, mace and salt into a large bowl.
