{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Chops With Dijon Sauce", "description": "In the Burgundy region of France, home of Dijon, pork chops are traditionally served in a sauce made with mustard, cream and white wine, and there are very few pairings that are better. Richard Olney, a prominent food writer and authority on French cooking, saut\u00e9ed sliced apples and chops and then baked them all together with cream and mustard dribbled on top. I prefer the method here, but you could always fry up some apples and serve them on the side. (For a dish with roots closer to Normandy than Burgundy, make the same recipe but omit the mustard, deglaze the pan with Calvados instead of wine and stir sliced saut\u00e9ed Granny Smiths into the sauce itself.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Reed"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/14/dining/14COOKING-PORK-CHOPS-DIJON/14COOKING-PORK-CHOPS-DIJON-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "dijon mustard, dry white wine, pork chops, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 885}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 533, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "744 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon butter", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "4 1 1/4-inch-thick center-cut rib or loin pork chops, bone in", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup chopped green onions or shallots", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "3/4 cup chicken or veal stock", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard (or more to taste)", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in the oil in a large deep skillet over high heat.
