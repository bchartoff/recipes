{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Jerk Shrimp", "description": "Sweet shrimp are the perfect canvas for this spicy jerk seasoning made with fresh chiles, fragrant thyme, scallions, garlic and spices. After a quick 15-minute marinade, the shrimp cook in mere minutes, picking up great char and smoky flavor from the grill. (You can even mimic the results indoors by broiling the shrimp on a sheet pan 6 inches from the heat for about 4 minutes.) This recipe comes with a warning: This is a superhot rub. For less heat but still spicy results, use just one chile; for an even milder version, remove the seeds from the chile before blending it. Should you have any jerk shrimp leftovers, they are great tossed into salad or tucked into tacos the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/10/dining/kc-grilled-jerk-shrimp/merlin_210913845_9d301278-f6d1-4efd-bb2e-f465d1357b36-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, main course", "keywords": "chili pepper, scallion, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 144}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola, plus more for greasing the grates", "3 scallions, 2 chopped into 1-inch pieces and 1 thinly sliced for garnish", "1 to 2 Scotch bonnet or habanero chiles, stemmed and halved (and seeds removed, for less heat, if desired)", "5 garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1 tablespoon turbinado or light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon ground allspice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 pound cleaned large, tail-on shrimp"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat grill to medium-high and grease the grates with oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, combine the 2 chopped scallions with the chiles and garlic, and pulse until finely chopped.
