The\u00a0Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews from\u00a0North Africa and the Middle East, have their own distinct traditional loaves. Here, use the raisins, eggs and full amount of honey to make a richer, festive Sephardic loaf that is delicious by itself; leave them out for a lean, savory Mizrahi bread that goes beautifully with Moroccan tagines and Middle Eastern mezes, salads and dips.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/02/dining/02CHALLAH1/02CHALLAH1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "2 round loaves", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "anise, caraway seeds, sesame seeds, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 111}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/75 grams raisins, dark or golden or a combination (optional)", "4 tablespoons/40 grams sesame seeds", "1 tablespoon/10 grams caraway or coriander seeds", "1 tablespoon/10 grams anise, cumin or poppy seeds", "1 envelope/7 grams active dry yeast", "5 cups/600 grams bread flour, more for dusting work surface", "2 1/2 tablespoons/30milliliters/30 grams extra-virgin olive oil, more for oiling bowl and pans", "2 to 4 tablespoons/30 to 60 grams honey (depending on how sweet you like your challah)", "2 eggs, at room temperature (optional)", "1 tablespoon/16 grams kosher salt", "Cornmeal, for dusting", "2 egg yolks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using, cover raisins in 2 cups/500 milliliters warm water and let plump for 30 minutes.\u00a0Drain well and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a skillet, toast 1 tablespoon sesame, the caraway and the anise or other seeds over moderate heat until fragrant, 2 minutes.
