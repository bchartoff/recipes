{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato and Gruy\u00e8re Gratin", "description": "This rich, cheese-laden gratin is a more savory take on the usual Thanksgiving sweet potato casserole, with sage and rosemary giving it an herbal bite. If you'd like to make it partway ahead, you can peel and slice the potatoes the day before; store in a sealable plastic bag in the fridge. You can also simmer the cream mixture (don\u2019t add eggs) and grate the cheese the day before as well, storing them covered in the refrigerator.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/08/dining/08COOKING-POTATO2/08COOKING-POTATO2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "gruy\u00e8re, parmesan, sweet potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 962}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 363, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "444 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, for pan and foil", "1/3 cup grated Parmesan", "2 cups heavy cream (or half-and-half)", "3 tablespoons fresh sage, chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped", "3 fat cloves garlic, grated or minced", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "3 large eggs, lightly beaten", "3 pounds sweet potatoes (about 4 large or 5 medium), peeled", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "1 2/3 cups/6 1/2 ounces grated Gruy\u00e8re"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and generously butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan or shallow gratin dish.
