{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Torrisi Turkey", "description": "The roast turkey breast that Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone serve for lunch at their restaurant Parm in New York City is about the moistest, most luxuriously flavorful turkey available on the planet: rich and buttery, deep with rich turkey taste. They wrap a brined breast in plastic wrap and aluminum foil and place it in an intensely humid low-temperature oven that leaves the meat dense with moisture, heavy with flavor. Then they paint a glaze of honey and roasted garlic on the meat and place it in a hot, dry oven to create a crust. The result is turkey that tastes emphatically of turkey. And you can do it at home.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/18/dining/Torrisi-Turkey/Torrisi-Turkey-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "garlic, turkey breast, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 545}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 573, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "58 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "815 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup kosher salt", "1 cup sugar", "2 boneless turkey breasts, 3 to 4 1/2 pounds each", "8 heads garlic, lightly smashed but intact", "4 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup honey", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon pepper", "1 tablespoon thyme leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To brine the turkey: In a medium saucepan, bring 2 quarts water to a boil with the salt and sugar.
