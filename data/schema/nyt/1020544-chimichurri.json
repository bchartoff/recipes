{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chimichurri", "description": "Chimichurri is a herbaceous and vinegary sauce from Argentina that\u2019s classically paired with grilled meats, especially beef, but its uses don't end there. You can combine it with a dollop of mayonnaise to <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020543-mayo-marinated-chicken-with-chimichurri\">marinate chicken cutlets</a>. (That same mayo-and-chimichurri mixture makes an excellent potato salad dressing, or toss it with sliced scallions and grilled or boiled corn cut from the cob.) Combine chimichurri with equal parts olive oil to use as a marinade and dressing for grilled vegetables. Add a few crushed cloves of garlic to that same mixture, brush it on a split ciabatta or baguette, and grill or broil it for an oregano-packed take on garlic bread. It may be tempting to think of a chimichurri as a sort of Argentine parallel to Italian pesto, but it is not: While pesto is made in a mortar and pestle and emulsified into a creamy mixture with a base mostly comprised of olive oil, chimichurri is made with chopped dried herbs that are steeped in hot salty water (the brine is called salmuera) and vinegar, with less olive oil added. Its texture comes from the dried herbs rehydrating in salt water. Chimichurri can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks; it will lose its bright green color, but it will improve in flavor with time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
