Substitute butternut squash, celery root or just about any root vegetable for the carrots, parsnips and potatoes.\u00a0The entire dish cooks in a large ovenproof skillet, but you could also transfer the filling to buttered ramekins for individual pies, or divide the mixture between two 8-inch pie dishes for two separate pies. Rich and creamy, it feeds a crowd, and can easily be prepared in advance: Refrigerate the cooked filling overnight, then warm it on the stovetop, assemble and bake.
