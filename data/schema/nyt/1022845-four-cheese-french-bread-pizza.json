{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Four-Cheese French Bread Pizza", "description": "Each cheese plays a special role in this French bread pizza: A combination of Parmesan and pecorino makes it especially nutty and salty; mozzarella melts evenly and a sharper deli-style provolone bridges the gap between them. Once you learn how to make the classic white sauce (technically a Mornay, which is a b\u00e9chamel with cheese added), you\u2019ll find dozens of ways to use it beyond pizza: Swap in an equal amount of grated Cheddar and toss it with pasta for an easy stovetop mac and cheese, or use Gruy\u00e8re, slather the sauce over ham on toast, and broil until bubbly and browned. The sauce can be made up to 3 days ahead of time; store tightly covered in the refrigerator until ready to use.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/19/dining/14FRENCHBREADREX1/merlin_200287173_1d4be0db-e6f2-45e4-abfe-c88e08146394-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, weeknight, pizza and calzones, main course", "keywords": "french bread, mozzarella, pecorino romano, provolone", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 182}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 cup whole milk", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "A few grinds of black pepper", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "1 loaf soft French bread, split lengthwise, insides mostly dug out", "4 ounces mozzarella, low-moisture and part-skim, or fresh (drained and patted dry, if necessary), grated or torn", "4 ounces sliced provolone (from the deli), cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 cup)", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan", "Red-pepper flakes or dried oregano, or both, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Heat oven to 450 degrees.
