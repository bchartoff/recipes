If your favorite after-work bar doesn't have G\u00e9n\u00e9py, ask them to get it. It's not crazy expensive, it plays well with many spirits, and it's also delicious on its own. Your favorite single-malt whiskey can be substituted for the Hakushu (even if it doesn't come from an equally high altitude).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/09/magazine/09drink2/09drink2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 12}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces Hakushu single-malt whiskey", "1/2 ounce Dolin G\u00e9n\u00e9py des Alpes", "3 ounces club soda", "Lemon slice."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour all ingredients into tall glass."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add ice, and stir gently."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Garnish with a lemon twist."}]}
