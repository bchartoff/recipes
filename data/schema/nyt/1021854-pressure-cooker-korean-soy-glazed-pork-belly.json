{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Korean Soy-Glazed Pork Belly", "description": "This hearty braise requires minimal ingredients and makes use of a pressure cooker to reduce hours of work into just 45 minutes of hands-off cooking. The pork belly soaks up the Korean-inspired marinade of soy sauce, garlic, ginger and scallions, and a good dose of black pepper balances the sweet-salty flavors. To finish, the cooking liquid is reduced into a silky sauce that glazes the meat. Serve the tender pork in crisp fresh lettuce cups to balance the richness of the meat. Leftovers can be chopped and reheated in tomato sauce for a quick and tasty Bolognese sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/09/dining/kc-korean-pork-belly/merlin_183224100_8bd6a0fa-1519-4ebc-8866-e47ad8155546-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, meat, main course", "keywords": "gochujang, instant pot, kimchi, pork belly, scallion, shiitake, soy sauce, turbinado sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 726}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "2 scallions, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)", "1/4 cup turbinado sugar (or 3 tablespoons granulated sugar)", "2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger", "3 dried shiitake mushrooms", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 1/2 pounds skin-on pork belly, sliced lengthwise 1-inch-thick then cut into 4-inch pieces", "Steamed rice, lettuce cups, kimchi and gochujang, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a pressure cooker, combine soy sauce, scallions, sugar, garlic, ginger, mushrooms and 1 teaspoon black pepper, and mix well.
