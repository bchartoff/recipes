The basic method is the same for French fries \u2014 the first frying cooks and the second, hotter frying crisps. Roman cimaroli or mammole artichokes do not have the sharp thorns of our American globe variety and are picked before their chokes have fully developed, so I have made some adjustments to the original recipe to remove the choke here. Don\u2019t let it intimidate you; the first frying and a grapefruit spoon or melon baller makes it relatively easy to manage.
