{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Simple Beans on Toast", "description": "These utterly simple beans come from Steve Sando, the owner of Rancho Gordo, which is known for its heirloom bean varieties. You can use any kind of dried bean (cannellini is pictured here); do not used canned beans. This recipe leans on great ingredients, which don't need much help, and lets them shine. That means you should use the best you've got, right down to the drizzle of olive oil that finishes the dish. If you do want to dress them up a bit, add a bay leaf at the beginning of cooking, and a sprig of thyme or rosemary during the last hour or so of cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
