{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chile-Oil Noodles With Cilantro", "description": "In this 20-minute recipe, a mixture of savory condiments coats bowlfuls of wide noodles chilled slightly by a quick rinse in cool water. While you cook the udon, take the time to prepare the sauce, abundant with contrasting flavors, and the fresh herbs. The sauce can be made in advance, but make sure it\u2019s at room temperature before tossing it with the noodles and the cilantro at the last minute. Substitutions are welcome: Swap in chile crisp in place of the chile oil with crunchy garlic, or scallions in place of garlic chives. Sichuan chile oil brings a citrusy flavor that is hard to replicate, so don\u2019t skip it. It can vary in spice level: For a milder sauce, use only the liquid oil, or add Sichuan peppercorns from the bottom of the oil for extra tingle. Fried shallots are here for texture, but omit them if you use chile crisp.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Judy Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/19/dining/19seveningrex8-chilenoodles1/merlin_211670976_baca6020-98a2-445d-ac13-cf0e41310899-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "chile crisp, chile oil, cilantro, sesame oil, udon noodle, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3023}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 ounces dried udon noodles", "1/4 cup chile oil with crunchy garlic", "2 tablespoons pure sesame oil", "2 teaspoons Sichuan chile oil, or to taste", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1/2 cup finely sliced garlic chives or scallions, plus more for garnish", "2 tablespoons store-bought fried shallots, crumbled by hand (optional)", "1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro (see Note), plus a few sprigs for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to boil and cook noodles according to package instructions, stirring from time to time to prevent them from sticking.
