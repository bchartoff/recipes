{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Bean Stew With Carrots, Fennel and Peas", "description": "A supply of dried white beans in the pantry means you can always make some sort of white bean stew without a trip to the store. White beans are welcome in any season, though this dish is perfect for spring, with its bright green peas. Use any kind of white bean: ordinary white northern or navy beans, larger cannellini or corona beans or, as pictured here, a small Italian heirloom variety called purgatory bean. This stew is versatile; it's equally delicious served hot or at room temperature, and it can be a first course, a main course or part of an antipasto. Finish with a drizzle of good, fruity extra virgin olive oil. The spicy herb topping makes a bright embellishment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/22/dining/22Kitchen1/22Kitchen1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, carrot, egg, fennel, peas, white beans, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 334}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 273, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "451 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups dried white beans (about 1 pound), picked over for debris and rinsed", "1 medium onion, peeled and halved, stuck with 2 cloves", "1 bay leaf", "1 small sprig rosemary", "Salt and pepper", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish", "1 large white onion, medium-diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "3 celery stalks, medium-diced (about 1 cup)", "6 orange carrots, medium-diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 or 2 fennel bulbs, medium-diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 teaspoon crushed fennel seed", "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 bunch small yellow carrots, peeled, and left whole or halved lengthwise (optional)", "1 cup fresh peas (from 2 pounds in the pod, or use frozen)", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped mint", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1/2 serrano chile, seeds removed and finely chopped", "4 large eggs, boiled 9 minutes, chilled in ice water, peeled and halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put beans in a heavy-bottomed pot along with clove-studded onion, bay leaf and rosemary.
