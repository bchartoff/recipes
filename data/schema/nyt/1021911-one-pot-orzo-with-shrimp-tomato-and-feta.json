{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Orzo With Shrimp, Tomato and Feta", "description": "Inspired by a Greek appetizer, shrimp saganaki, this one-pot recipe adds orzo and grape tomatoes to make a complete meal. Blistering the grape tomatoes coaxes out their natural sweetness, which pairs well with the salty feta. For a vegetarian version, skip the shrimp and stir in some spinach or arugula at the end. Warm up leftovers by adding a splash of water to loosen the sauce, then drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with crumbled feta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/11/dining/yf-orzo-shrimp-tomato/merlin_182183394_90fc1441-ab93-45b9-9700-b4fc25d811de-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "feta, orzo, shrimp, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1296}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large garlic cloves, grated or minced (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1 1/2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes,\u00a0plus more for serving", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound shrimp, peeled, deveined and patted dry", "1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes", "1 cup orzo", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "1/2 cup crumbled feta", "1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves and fine stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing bowl, combine half the garlic with 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon dried oregano,\u00a01 teaspoon red-pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon salt.
