{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Focaccia", "description": "Seasoned with little more than olive oil and crunchy sea salt, focaccia is an ancient bread that is unexpectedly easy to make. Once a staple at Caroline Fidanza\u2019s now-closed sandwich shop, Saltie, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, this recipe from the \u201cSaltie: A Cookbook\u201d is perfect on its own, but also serves as a base upon which you can experiment. If you want to alter its flavor, sprinkling some aromatic dry herbs on top of the dough provides deep savory notes. Or decorate it vibrantly with the vegetables and fresh herbs of your choosing for an Instagram-worthy focaccia garden (see Tip).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amelia Nierenberg"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/29/dining/24focacciarex/merlin_171784197_e47ce275-ead0-41d9-a4d5-e0fe9e239c8f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13-inch pan", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, snack, breads, quick breads, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "active dry yeast, flour, olive oil, rosemary, sea salt, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1604}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/4 cups/415 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast", "1 3/4 cups/420 milliliters warm water", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing", "1 1/2 teaspoons coarse sea salt", "Whole or chopped fresh rosemary leaves, dried oregano, fennel seeds, herbes de Provence or other dried herbs, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, kosher salt and yeast.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and transfer to the prepared pan. Using your hands, spread the dough out as much as possible, adding oil to the dough if needed to keep it from sticking. (Don\u2019t worry if the dough doesn\u2019t yet cover the full pan; it will once it relaxes and rises.) Place the dough in a warm place and let rise until about doubled in bulk. The rising time will vary considerably depending on the season. (In the summer, it may take only 20 minutes for the dough to warm up and rise; in the winter, it can take 1 hour or more.) When the dough is ready, it should be room temperature, spread out on the sheet and fluffy."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Using your palms, pat down the focaccia to an even thickness of about 1 inch, then, using your fingertips, dimple the entire dough. Drizzle it with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle the entire surface of the focaccia evenly with the sea salt and herbs, if using."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake, rotating once front to back, until the top is uniformly golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the focaccia on the baking sheet to a wire rack to cool, then slide out of the pan. Enjoy it hot. (Focaccia deteriorates in quality after the first day. If there is some left over, wrap it tightly in plastic and store at room temperature for another day. Day-old focaccia is delicious in soup.)"}], "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021036-focaccia"}
