{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi", "description": "Sometimes called mak kimchi, this kimchi formula starts with chopped napa cabbage and is as easy as dressing a salad. You just toss everything together in a large bowl. Fish sauce anchors the kimchi sauce with incredible savoriness, while gochugaru, the Korean red-pepper powder, lends a deep crimson sheen and mild, fruity heat. Whatever chopped vegetables you add to the onion-garlic-ginger pur\u00e9e will lend their own natural sweetness as they ferment with the cabbage; scallions and daikon are the most traditional, but carrot works in a pinch and lends great color. We all need a good burp every now and then, so be sure to open the lid of your jar every couple of days to allow the gas from the fermentation process to escape. For the spice-averse, start with 1/4 cup of gochugaru, or turn to <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023417-baek-kimchi-white-kimchi\">baek kimchi</a>, which is a fragrant, chile-free version.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/24/dining/22KIMJANGREX1-kimchi/22KIMJANGREX1-kimchi-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P2DT2H30M", "recipeYield": "1/2 gallon", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "condiments, pickles, side dish", "keywords": "fish sauce, food processor, gochugaru, napa cabbage, plan-ahead, healthy", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 278}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium head napa cabbage (2 to 2 1/2 pounds), any dirty outer leaves removed", "3 tablespoons coarse kosher salt or 5 tablespoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 medium green apple or Asian pear, peeled, quartered and cored", "1 small yellow onion, peeled and quartered", "10 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/3 cup gochugaru (Korean red pepper)", "1/3 cup fish sauce", "3 scallions, trimmed", "1 medium carrot or 1/2 medium daikon, peeled", "1 tablespoon pine nuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dry-brine the cabbage: Rinse the head of cabbage under cold running water, making sure to get in between the leaves.

After this, the cabbage should have released even more of its liquid; it\u2019s OK if the liquid doesn\u2019t completely cover the cabbage at this point, though it may. Refrigerate the kimchi to finish fermenting until it\u2019s sour, 2 to 3 weeks and up to 6 months, at which point it will be very, very sour and should be eaten or turned into jjigae. Check (and taste!) the kimchi every 2 to 3 days both to familiarize yourself with the fermentation process but also to allow gas to escape.\u00a0"}], "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023416-kimchi"}
