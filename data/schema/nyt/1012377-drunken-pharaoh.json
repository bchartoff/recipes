While the Manischewitz\u2019s cloying sweetness comes through (one suspects it would take a full gallon of bourbon to subdue that candied Concord grapiness), the drink is determinedly balanced, and rather festive to boot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Miles"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/22/dining/pharoah-still/pharoah-still-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounce bourbon", "2 ounces Manischewitz wine", "1/2 ounce lemon juice", "Club soda, to top", "Sugared matzo, for rimming glass"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Coat rim of a glass with simple syrup, then dip it into the matzo mix so that the matzo adheres to the edge.
