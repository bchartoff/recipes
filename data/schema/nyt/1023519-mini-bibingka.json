{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mini Bibingka", "description": "Bibingka is a Filipino cake traditionally made with rice flour and coconut milk and baked to supreme fluffiness over banana leaves in a terra-cotta oven. These versions are built to fit in the palm of the hand. Ray Luna, who ran the much loved coffee shop Mountain Province in Brooklyn, adapted the recipe from his lola (grandmother), using self-rising flour instead of rice flour and coconut cream for extra richness. The cakes are delicious when made with just the requisite five ingredients, but for a touch of refinement, follow Luna\u2019s lead and bake in banana leaves, to infuse a green-tea scent. The final touch: macapuno, opalescent strands from rare, prized coconuts with jellylike flesh.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/02/dining/02EAT-mini-bibingka1/02EAT-mini-bibingka1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 dozen mini cakes", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "christmas, coconut cream, cupcake, self-rising flour, superfine sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large sheet banana leaf (from a 1-pound package), optional", "9 tablespoons/128 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing pans", "1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters unsweetened coconut cream", "2 large eggs\u00a0", "1 cup/200 grams superfine (caster) sugar", "2 cups/250 grams self-rising flour", "1 cup macapuno (coconut sport), optional (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
