{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn Casserole", "description": "Here is a from-scratch version of the classic corn casserole, a popular holiday side dish in the southeastern United States that is traditionally made using store-bought Jiffy cornbread mix. If you\u2019ve never had corn casserole before, you\u2019re really missing out: It\u2019s like an incredibly moist cornbread studded with fresh corn kernels. (Frozen corn can be used in the cold weather months.) Two pounds of corn kernels are bound together with a simple batter of flour, baking powder, cornmeal, Cheddar, eggs, melted butter and sour cream, then poured into a baking pan, topped with more cheese, and baked until bubbly. Fresh rosemary and scallions, untraditional and optional additions, add savory notes that balance out the sweetness of the corn.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/dining/as-corn-casserole/as-corn-casserole-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cheddar, corn, cornmeal, eggs, rosemary, scallion, sour cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 555}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 pounds frozen or fresh corn kernels (about 6 1/2 cups)", "4 scallions, thinly sliced crosswise (optional)", "1 fresh rosemary sprig (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup fine or coarse yellow cornmeal", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 cup sour cream", "2 large eggs", "1 1/2 cups freshly grated Cheddar or Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
