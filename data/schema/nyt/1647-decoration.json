Using a toothpick, place a tiny dot of green color paste on the palm of your hand. Sprinkle about one tablespoon of sugar from one batch over the paste, rub your palms together until the sugar turns evenly green, and return the sugar to the bowl from which it came. Now, blend the sugar together until you create an even shade of green without dark or light spots. Wash your hands and repeat this process to make the purple and yellow sugar."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the confectioners' sugar, lemon juice and two tablespoons of the water in a large bowl and beat with a wire whisk until the icing is smooth. If the icing is too stiff to spread with a metal spatula, beat in additional water. Spread the icing over the cake, letting any excess run down the sides. While the icing is still wet, sprinkle the colored sugar over the cake without overlapping the colors, creating three large spots of color. Decorate with the candied cherries."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1647-decoration"}
