Delicata, even easier to peel and dice, would be another good choice but you won\u2019t get the bright orange color, which  is beautiful against the chopped blanched chard, whose stems lend texture to the dish. Red quinoa \u2013 just a sprinkling \u2013 makes a great finish, contributing another texture and more color. You can make a meal of the skillet combo if you top it with a poached egg, or you can serve it as a side dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/16/science/18recipeforhealth/18recipeforhealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 193, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "782 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 generous bunch Swiss chard (about 3/4 pound), with wide ribs", "Salt", "1 medium-size butternut squash, about 2 pounds, peeled and cut into small dice (1/2 inch or a little smaller), about 4 cups diced", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 large or 2 medium garlic cloves, minced", "3/4 teaspoon Aleppo pepper (more to taste)", "1/3 cup cooked red quinoa"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil while you strip leaves from chard ribs.
