{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame Salmon Bowls", "description": "This one-pot meal, which is inspired by chirashi, or Japanese rice and raw fish bowls, features a savory vinegared rice that\u2019s typically served with sushi. Traditionally, the rice is cooked first, then mixed with vinegar, but here, the rice is cooked in vinegar-seasoned water to eliminate a step. The result is sticky rice that\u2019s tangy and sweet, and a perfect bed for fatty salmon. The salmon is added toward the end to steam directly on top of the rice for an easy one-pan meal. Packaged coleslaw is a time saver, eliminating extra knife work. Make a double batch of the zesty dressing for drizzling over roasted vegetables or green leafy salads the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/14/dining/kc-steamed-salmon-bowls/kc-steamed-salmon-bowls-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, one pot, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cucumber, grain bowl, rice vinegar, salmon fillet, sushi rice, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5182}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup unseasoned rice vinegar", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "1 1/2 cups sushi rice (short-grain white rice), rinsed until water runs clear", "1 1/2 pounds skinless salmon fillet, cut into 1-inch cubes", "1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar", "2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "2 tablespoons coarsely chopped scallions", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger (from one 2-inch piece)", "3 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced", "8 ounces green coleslaw mix (about 3 packed cups)", "1 avocado, halved, pitted and thinly sliced", "Torn toasted nori sheets, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saucepan, combine rice vinegar, sugar and salt; stir to dissolve the sugar.
