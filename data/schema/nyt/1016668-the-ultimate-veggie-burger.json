{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Ultimate Veggie Burger", "description": "You make a veggie burger because you want the hamburger experience without the meat. This one delivers. It\u2019s got a firm, beefy texture that takes on the char and smoke of the grill, but is adaptable enough to cook inside on your stove. The enemy of a veggie burger is mushiness, which stems from a high moisture content. To combat that, the very watery ingredients \u2013 mushrooms, tofu, beans and beets \u2013 are roasted to both dehydrate them somewhat and intensify their flavors. Yes, the ingredient list here is long; you need a diverse lot to make a good veggie burger. And each one adds something in terms of flavor and/or texture. Garnish this any way you like, and don\u2019t forget to toast the buns.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/02/dining/mc-veggie-burger/mc-veggie-burger-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "6 burgers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers", "keywords": "main course, mushroom, tofu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1388}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 441, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "629 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces extra-firm tofu, drained", "Olive oil", "1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "1 (15-ounce) can kidney beans, drained", "1 medium beet, peeled and coarsely grated (3/4 cup)", "3/4 cup tamari almonds or cashews", "1/3 cup panko bread crumbs", "2 ounces Cotija cheese or queso blanco, crumbled or grated (about 1/2 cup)", "2 large eggs", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "2 scallions, sliced", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "3/4 teaspoon dulce piment\u00f3n or sweet smoked paprika", "4 ounces tempeh, crumbled", "1/2 cup cooked brown rice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
