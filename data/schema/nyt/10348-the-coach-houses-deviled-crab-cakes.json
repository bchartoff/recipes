These deviled-crab cakes are from the Coach House, at 110 Waverly Place in Greenwich Village, a space now occupied by Babbo. The crab cakes are made with fresh lump crab meat, and the recipe yields a spicy cake that is \"admirably moist in the center and crisp on the exterior.\"", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Craig Claiborne"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H50M", "recipeYield": "10 servings as first course, 5 as main course", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, lump crab meat", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 283, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "488 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh crab meat, preferably lump", "5 tablespoons butter", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "1/2 cup finely chopped celery", "2 1/2 tablespoons plus 2 cups fresh bread crumbs made from 2-day-old bread", "1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley", "Salt to taste if desired", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper", "1 egg yolk", "1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard", "2 tablespoons heavy cream", "1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1/2 teaspoon Tabasco", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1 cup flour", "1 egg, lightly beaten", "1/2 cup milk", "Green sauce (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10349-sauce-verte-green-sauce\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>), optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pick over crab meat, removing all shell and cartilage.
