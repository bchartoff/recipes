I was wandering along a side street in Paris\u2019s 11th Arrondissement, saw these cookies on a counter in the back of Mokonuts, a small restaurant, and walked right in to buy a few. The baker Moko Hirayama has worked on her recipe with so much care and invention that it\u2019s almost difficult to see any family resemblance to cookie's inspiration: the classic American chocolate-chip cookie. Her cookies have chunks of fine chocolate (not store-bought chips), dried cranberries, rye flour and a good measure of poppy seeds, for color, crunch and surprise. Plan ahead: Once the dough is made and formed into balls, it should be refrigerated overnight before baking. Fresh from the oven, the cookies are fragile; they firm as they cool. They\u2019ll keep for about three days at room temperature or they can be frozen for up to two months; in either case, they should be wrapped well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/09/magazine/09mag-OnDessert-image1/09mag-OnDessert-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "About 15 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, dried cranberries, poppy seed, rye flour, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 975}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 283, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "158 milligrams", "sugarContent": "21 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons (130 grams) medium rye flour", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (85 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "10 tablespoons (140 grams) unsalted butter at cool room temperature", "1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar", "1/2 cup (100 grams) light brown sugar", "1 large egg", "1/3 cup (50 grams) poppy seeds", "2/3 cup (80 grams) moist, plump dried cranberries", "4 ounces (113 grams) bittersweet chocolate, chopped into chunks", "Flake salt, such as Maldon, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together the rye flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, sea salt and baking soda; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Working with a mixer (fitted with the paddle attachment, if you have one), beat the butter and both sugars together on medium speed for 3 minutes, until blended; scrape thebowl as needed.
