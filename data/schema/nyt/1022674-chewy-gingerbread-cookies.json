{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chewy Gingerbread Cookies", "description": "This gingerbread is maxed out on spice, packed with two types of fiery ginger and lots of prickly black pepper. Cozy from all the warm spices as well as from molasses, they\u2019re perfect for munching on while tree-trimming. The center of the cookie is fudgy and dense, while the outside edges stay crisp \u2014 like the best brownie, but in gingerbread form. That chewy-crispy texture is thanks to the confectioners\u2019 sugar in the dough and a light coating of ginger-spiced sugar. Be sure to use true molasses and not blackstrap molasses; blackstrap molasses has less sugar, more salt and acidity, and can change the way the dough browns, spreads and interacts with the leavening.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sohla El-Waylly"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08COOKIESREX20-GINGERBREAD/01COOKIESREX20-GINGERBREAD-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "black pepper, christmas cookie, freezer friendly, fresh ginger, ground ginger, molasses, plan-ahead, christmas, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1886}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 tablespoons/200 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "3 tablespoons/50 grams finely grated fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon ground ginger", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "2 cups/240 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3 tablespoons/60 grams unsulphured molasses", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 large egg, room temperature", "2 cups/250 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons ground ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan over medium, melt butter until foamy, about 3 minutes.
