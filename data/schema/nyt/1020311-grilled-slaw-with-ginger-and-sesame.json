{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Slaw With Ginger and Sesame", "description": "Napa makes an excellent cabbage for grilling. Its elongated shape provides greater surface area to char \u2014 and thus smoke \u2014 over a hot fire than a round cabbage. Its leaves are less tightly packed than conventional cabbage, allowing for deep penetration of the smoke flavor. Also known as Chinese cabbage, napa cabbage is native to China and pairs well with Asian seasonings, such as sesame oil, rice vinegar and ginger. To notch up the heat, add a spoonful of Asian chile paste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/07/dining/02slawrex2/02slawrex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, slaws, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, summer, ginger, napa cabbage, pear, rice vinegar, scallion, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 36}, "recipeIngredient": ["Canola or grapeseed oil, for brushing the grate", "1 head napa cabbage (about 2 pounds)", "1 Asian pear", "2 scallions", "2 to 3 tablespoons sesame oil, plus 3 tablespoons for the dressing", "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 red bell pepper", "2 jalape\u00f1os", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1 garlic clove, minced", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons black or toasted white sesame seeds (optional)", "1 teaspoon Chinese or Vietnamese chile paste (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Light your grill, building a hot fire and set it up for direct grilling.
