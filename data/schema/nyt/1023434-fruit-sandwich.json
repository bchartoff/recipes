{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fruit Sandwich", "description": "The origins of the fruit sandwich are believed to go back to Japan\u2019s luxury fruit stores and the fruit parlors attached to them. This version comes from Yudai Kanayama, a native of Hokkaido who runs the restaurants the Izakaya NYC and Dr Clark in New York. Fresh fruit \u2014 fat strawberries, golden mango, kiwi with black ellipses of seeds, or whatever you like \u2014 is engulfed in whipped cream mixed with mascarpone, which makes it implausibly airy yet dense. (In Japanese, the texture is called fuwa-fuwa: fluffy like a cloud.) Pressed on either side are crustless slices of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016275-japanese-milk-bread\">shokupan</a>, milk bread that agreeably springs back. The sandwich looks like dessert but isn\u2019t, or not exactly; it makes for a lovely little meal that feels slightly illicit, as if for a moment there are no rules.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/28/dining/28EAT-fruit-sandwich-1/merlin_211778193_69049d61-7b33-4b2f-96a1-abe2bd6a1064-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "2 sandwiches (2 to 4 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, for two, lunch, snack, sandwiches, dessert, main course", "keywords": "fruit, heavy cream, mascarpone", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 264}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons/200 grams mascarpone\u00a0", "1 tablespoon honey", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/200 grams heavy cream, chilled", "4 slices <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016275-japanese-milk-bread\">shokupan (milk bread)</a> or any fluffy white sandwich bread", "8 to 10 pieces cut fruit (1-inch chunks), such as strawberries, banana, mango and kiwi\u00a0\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chill a mixing bowl and the beater attachments of a hand mixer in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
