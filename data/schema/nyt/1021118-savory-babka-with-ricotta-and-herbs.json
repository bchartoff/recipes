Some optional chopped ham or olives give the bread an even saltier tang, but you can leave it out for something milder. Leftover babka makes excellent toast or \u2014 if you want to take it to another level of gooeyness \u2014 grilled cheese sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/27/dining/22apperex/merlin_172693077_4c1b1e9c-abd6-4c51-a2fd-4602fd12e162-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "snack, breads", "keywords": "bread flour, butter, eggs, ham, herbs, parmesan, ricotta, hanukkah", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 431}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/80 milliliters whole milk", "1 1/2 teaspoons active dry or instant yeast", "Pinch of granulated sugar", "2 1/2 cups/310 grams bread flour, or use all-purpose", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 large eggs, at room temperature, lightly beaten", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more as needed", "1 cup/230 grams fresh ricotta, or use cottage cheese, soft goat cheese or cream cheese", "1/4 cup/25 grams grated Parmesan, plus more for sprinkling", "3 tablespoons finely chopped herbs, such as basil, mint, parsley, thyme leaves or cilantro, or a combination", "1 scallion, finely chopped", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "2 tablespoons chopped ham, prosciutto, salami or olives (optional)", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan on the stovetop, or in a bowl in the microwave, warm the milk until lukewarm, but not hot (about 110 degrees).
