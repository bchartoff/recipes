Key limes are small, yellowish, seedy and wildly more tart than their ordinary Persian counterparts. Unfortunately, Key limes grow slowly, so many Florida farmers replaced their Key lime trees with Persian ones. You can buy bottled Key lime juice at most supermarkets, but you can also make this easy pie with regular limes, although it won't be quite as delightfully tart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "THE NEW YORK TIMES"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/dining/key-lime-pie-2/key-lime-pie-2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday, pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, graham cracker crust, lime juice, sweetened condensed milk, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 260}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 egg yolks", "1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk", "1/2 cup Key lime juice (see note)", "1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar", "1 9-inch graham cracker crust", "Whipped cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
