{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkish Burned Milk Pudding (Kazandibi)", "description": "This delicate Ottoman milk pudding has a burned bottom layer that adds a toasted-marshmallow, caramel-like flavor reminiscent of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The pudding itself is thickened with cornstarch for a soft, delightfully wobbly dessert that\u2019s gently perfumed with mastic. You can find mastic, an aromatic tree-sap resin harvested in the Mediterranean, from specialty markets and spice shops. But if you can\u2019t get it, feel free to substitute more vanilla extract, using a full teaspoon for the recipe. You need to make this at least 6 hours ahead so it has a chance to firm up. Making it a day or two ahead is even better. You will need a flameproof 9-by-13-inch metal baking pan \u2014 as long as it's made entirely of metal without an enamel coating, it should work. Avoid glass, which will shatter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/multimedia/clark-turk-milk-pudding/clark-turk-milk-pudding-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H45M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "turkish", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "dessert, mastic, milk, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 300, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "27 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 chickpea-size piece of mastic", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/60 grams cornstarch", "1/2 cup/55 grams all-purpose flour", "3 cups/475 milliliters whole milk", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a mortar and pestle, grind mastic with 1 teaspoon sugar."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, dissolve cornstarch and flour in 1 1/2 cups cold water."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat milk and remaining sugar, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves.
