{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Miso Meatballs", "description": "Ground chicken breast meat is fairly lean, so milk is added to this recipe to keep them moist and tender. As the meatballs bake, the miso caramelizes into savory bites of sweet-salty umami. Crumbled Ritz crackers add richness and create a more juicy meatball (but plain, dry bread crumbs will also work). To make the Ritz crumbs, place the crackers in a resealable plastic bag and lightly crush them with the back of a wooden spoon or measuring cup. These also make a tasty hors d'oeuvre: Simply roll the mixture into smaller 1-inch balls. For a quick dipping sauce, combine 2 parts soy sauce to 1 part distilled white vinegar, and add sliced scallions, or red-pepper flakes, if you like heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/16/dining/kc-chicken-miso-meatballs/kc-chicken-miso-meatballs-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, meatballs", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, ground chicken, milk, miso, ritz crackers, low-carb", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 354}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 250, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "638 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup whole milk", "3 tablespoons sweet white miso", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 teaspoons kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 cup finely crushed Ritz crackers (12 crackers)", "1 pound ground chicken"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
