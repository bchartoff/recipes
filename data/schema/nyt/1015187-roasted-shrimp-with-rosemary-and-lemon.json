{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Shrimp With Rosemary and Lemon", "description": "Shrimp is now the most popular seafood in America, and this bright and fragrant treatment couldn't be simpler. Just scatter several rosemary branches onto a sheet pan and top with shrimp. Drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil then roast until the shrimp are peachy pink all over. \n\nFor the most part, the shrimp will tell you when they\u2019re done. Certainly they\u2019re ready once they\u2019re pink, though very large shrimp may need an extra minute to cook through. To check, slice one in half; if it\u2019s opaque, or even nearly so, season to taste and start eating.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/09/dining/With-Rosemary-and-Lemon/With-Rosemary-and-Lemon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 266}, "recipeIngredient": ["Several rosemary branches", "1 1/2 pounds peeled shrimp", "Olive oil", "Fresh lemon juice", "Lemon wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 500."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay a bunch of rosemary branches in the bottom of a roasting pan, and put 1 1/2 pounds peeled shrimp on top.
