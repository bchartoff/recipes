{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan Pizza", "description": "The pizza authority Anthony Falco, once czar of the oven at Roberta\u2019s in Brooklyn and now (literally!) an international pizza consultant, grew up in Austin, Tex., eating his great-grandmother\u2019s Sicilian grandma pies, which he liked a great deal, and personal pan pizzas from Pizza Hut, which he loved unreservedly. This recipe, he told me in 2018, pays homage to that buttery, high-lofted pie, with a crisp bottom crust, a slightly sweet sauce and an enormous amount of cheese. Slices of pepperoni make a beautiful topping, cupping in the heat of the oven and drizzling crimson oil across the edges of the pie. <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019336-pizza-dough\">The dough</a> takes a long time to proof and the recipe delivers a lot of it, so making the recipe is a great excuse for planning a pizza party. Cast-iron pans are best for the baking, but square or rectangular baking pans with high sides will do nicely in a pinch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/03/magazine/03Eat1/03Eat1-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT21H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "pizza and calzones", "keywords": "crushed canned tomatoes, honey, mozzarella, pepperoni, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 978}, "recipeIngredient": ["1000 grams unbleached all-purpose flour, approximately 8 cups", "30 grams kosher salt, approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons", "700 grams lukewarm water, approximately 2 3/4 cups", "60 grams unsalted butter, preferably high-fat European-style, approximately 1/4 cup, melted", "40 grams olive oil, approximately 3 tablespoons, plus more to grease pans", "5 grams active dry yeast, approximately 1 3/4 teaspoons", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 clove garlic, peeled and minced", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "Pinch of chile flakes, to taste", "1 28-ounce can chopped or crushed tomatoes", "2 tablespoons honey, or to taste", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste", "Olive oil", "Part-skim mozzarella, roughly grated, 525 grams or 4 1/2 cups: 175 grams or 1 1/2 cups per pie", "Fresh mozzarella, cut into cubes, 300 grams or 3 cups: 100 grams or 1 cup per pie", "Sliced pepperoni, to taste", "3 pinches fresh oregano, or 3 teaspoons dried: 1 pinch or teaspoon per pie"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough a day or two before you want to bake; the recipe makes enough for three pies.
