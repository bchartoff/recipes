{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Chicken in a Butter Crust", "description": "Like chicken potpie and chicken noodle soup, this dish is all about the traditional flavors of home cooking, but concentrated to the nth degree. The chef Barbara Lynch based this easy one-pan dinner on a French dish called poulet en pain \u2014 chicken in bread \u2014 but she uses a buttery pie crust instead of bread dough. The crisp crust with juicy chicken and a fragrant vegetable stuffing is indescribably good and surprisingly easy to pull off. You can finish baking it up to two hours before serving \u2014 or even longer, as it\u2019s also good at room temperature. Ms. Lynch recommends it as picnic fare.\n\nThis stuffing is a familiar one, but any combination of saut\u00e9ed vegetables and aromatics could be used, like mushrooms, winter squash or fennel; garlic, ginger or leeks; tarragon and parsley.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/19/dining/19CHEF3/19CHEF3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 247}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/360 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "6 ounces/170 grams cold unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), cut into large dice", "1 whole chicken, about 3 1/2 pounds, giblets removed", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil or butter", "2 large celery stalks, cut into small dice", "1 large carrot, peeled and cut into small dice", "1 onion or 2 shallots, peeled and chopped", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, thyme or a combination", "1 egg white"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine flour, salt and sugar and mix briefly to combine.
