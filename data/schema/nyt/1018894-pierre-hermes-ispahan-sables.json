Each of the almost 40 members of the clan include the flavors of roses and raspberries and many include lychees, too. They\u2019re all memorably aromatic and their flavors are haunting. This sabl\u00e9, a French shortbread, might be the simplest sweet in the family, but its textures and tastes are no less sophisticated \u2013 or irresistible \u2013 for being easy slice-and-bakes. The cookies get both their flavor and fragrance from freeze-dried raspberries and rose extract. I\u2019ve been using Star Kay White extract. If you choose a different one, start with just a little and then decide if you\u2019d like more.  Floral flavorings can be tricky \u2013 a little is lovely, just a smidge more than that can be too much.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/13/magazine/13ondessert/13mag-13ondessert.t_CA0-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "About 60 cookies.", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert, freeze dried raspberries, rose extract", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 322}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup (60 grams) sanding sugar", "1/4 teaspoon pure rose extract (like Star Kay White)", "Red liquid food coloring", "1/2 cup (10 grams) freeze-dried raspberries", "1 1/2 cups (204 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 stick plus 3 tablespoons (155 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/3 cup (67 grams) sugar", "1/2 teaspoon pure rose extract (like Star Kay White)", "1/4 teaspoon fleur de sel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the sugar: Put the sugar, extract and a few drops of coloring in a small zipper-lock plastic bag, seal the bag and shake until the color is even.
