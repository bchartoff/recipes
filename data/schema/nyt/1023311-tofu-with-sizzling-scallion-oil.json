{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tofu With Sizzling Scallion Oil", "description": "This refreshing weeknight meal comes together in less than 15 minutes and barely requires turning on the stove. Aromatic garlic, ginger and scallions are gently heated in oil until they sizzle and infuse it, turning into a fragrant, lively sauce for mild silken tofu. Peppery arugula and a final drizzle of tangy cilantro sauce brighten the dish. Enjoy with steamed rice for a heftier meal, or top with fried eggs. Leftover tofu can be stored in the scallion oil and refrigerated; it will have absorbed even more flavor the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/18/dining/kc-tofu-with-sizzling-scallion-oil-copy/merlin_210788811_86f0f18b-21a2-40c1-93ea-7a785d725cd7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, beans, main course", "keywords": "healthy, scallion, silken tofu, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 420}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14- to 16-ounce) package silken tofu", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and pepper", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions\u00a0", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced, peeled ginger", "2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "2 teaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar", "2 cups baby arugula"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the tofu from its package; drain the tofu then pat it dry.
