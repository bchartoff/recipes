{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh and Wild Mushroom Stew", "description": "Craving wild mushrooms? My compromise is to make a stew using mostly cultivated mushrooms. But I give them a boost of wild flavor in a couple of ways. The first is to make an intense, flavorful broth with a handful of dried porcini. The other is to actually buy some wild mushrooms. A scant half-pound of chanterelles, even if pricey, won\u2019t break the bank. The rest of the rustic stew (call it a ragout if you wish) is made of shiitake, cremini and oyster mushrooms. As it simmers, this saucy, herbaceous mushroom stew gains depth and character. Spooned over pasta or nestled up to a soft mound of polenta, it evokes the comfort of home and the primal in each bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/06/dining/recipes-wildmushroomstew/recipes-wildmushroomstew-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "main course, mushroom, wild mushrooms", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1049}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 129, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "550 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds cultivated brown mushrooms, like shiitake, cremini or portobello", "1/2 pound pale wild mushrooms, like chanterelle (or use King trumpet or oyster)", "Extra virgin olive oil", "1 large onion, diced", "Salt and pepper", "1 teaspoon chopped thyme", "1 teaspoon chopped sage or rosemary", "Pinch red pepper flakes or cayenne", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "3 small ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "Porcini broth, heated, or use chicken or vegetable broth", "1 tablespoon butter", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Clean mushrooms, keeping colors separate, and trim tough stems.
