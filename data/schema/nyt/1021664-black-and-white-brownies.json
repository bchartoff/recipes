{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black and White Brownies", "description": "Baking big chunks of white chocolate into gooey, bittersweet brownies adds contrast of both color and texture. Even better, the edges of any exposed white chocolate chunks caramelize as they bake, turning golden and toasty-flavored. For the deepest flavor, be sure to use a good brand of white chocolate, one with cocoa butter as a main ingredient. The brownies will keep for up to 4 days stored in an airtight container at room temperature, and up to a week when stored in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/02/dining/30cookiesrex5-brownies/merlin_180351618_d41b738c-c570-420a-b986-3d144b5ac17a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "16 brownies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "birthday, christmas, thanksgiving, brownie, butter, cocoa powder, flour, white chocolate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 282}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, plus more for greasing", "2 ounces/55 grams unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped or broken up in 1/2- to 1-inch pieces (1/3 cup)", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters neutral oil, such as sunflower, grapeseed or canola", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/30 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher sea salt", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3 ounces white chocolate, coarsely chopped, or 1/2 cup white chocolate chunks", "Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees, and lightly grease an 8-inch square baking pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt unsweetened chocolate and butter in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a rubber spatula, scrape chocolate mixture into large bowl.
