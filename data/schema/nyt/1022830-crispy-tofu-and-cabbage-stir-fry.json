The flavor of the stir-fry is propelled by using the coriander plant multiple ways: Combining coriander seeds with fresh stems and leaves \u2014 also known as cilantro \u2014 creates a range of complex but related flavors. Then there\u2019s what might be the quickest \u2014 and your new favorite \u2014 way to cook cabbage: When large pieces of cabbage are cooked undisturbed in a hot pan, they don\u2019t have a chance to turn to mush.
