{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Roll With Coffee-Caramel Cream", "description": "A roulade is a classic dessert made by rolling a thin cake around a flavorful filling, which creates an inviting swirl once sliced. This roulade starts with a subtly spiced, moist pumpkin cake that is wrapped around a rich filling made with cream cheese, heavy cream, caramel and coffee. The filling is bittersweet and slightly savory, which works nicely with the earthy pumpkin sponge. Make sure to use very finely ground coffee, like what you would use to make a cup of pour-over.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/dining/sse-pumpkin-roll/merlin_179685645_2437644b-4356-4f8e-bec6-0fecb17a1e68-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "cinnamon, coffee, cream cheese, flour, heavy cream, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, sugar, pumpkin,, fall, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 409}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter, for greasing", "1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/240 grams canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "3 large eggs", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/110 grams dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy cream", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 teaspoons very finely ground coffee", "8 ounces cream cheese, cut into cubes and softened to room temperature", "1/4 cup/30 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
