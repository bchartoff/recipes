{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Cherry Upside-Down Cake", "description": "There\u2019s a little black pepper in this cake, which provides just enough heat to enhance the sweetness of the cherries. If you\u2019re worried about the pepper, cut back on the amount called for, but if you\u2019re excited about it, you may want to double it. This is a sweet, rustic and rich upside-down cake that\u2019s sturdy enough to hold up to its juicy fruit topping. Once the finished cake gets inverted onto a platter, the extra cherry juice soaks back into the cake as it cools, which means it gets better as it sits. Serve the cake with lemon whipped cream made by beating cold heavy cream with the leftover lemon juice and some sugar until stiff. It\u2019s helpful for covering up any imperfections in the cake, too!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/03/dining/jg-cherry-upside-down-cake/jg-cherry-upside-down-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, one pot, dessert", "keywords": "black pepper, cherries, lemon, pepper, sour cream, sugar, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 246}, "recipeIngredient": ["Yields One 9-inch cake", "1 pound/450 grams sweet cherries, halved and pitted (about 2 1/2 cups)", "1/4 packed cup/55 grams light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons lemon juice", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon coarse ground black or white pepper, plus more if you like", "8 tablespoons/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted and cooled to room temperature", "2 large eggs, whites and yolks separated", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters sour cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/240 milliliters cold heavy whipping cream", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
