{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saut\u00e9ed Beets With Pasta, Sage and Brown Butter", "description": "Give a cook a beet, and he\u2019ll probably do one of two things with it: Reject it for fear of turning the kitchen into a juicy red crime scene, or roast it and serve it with goat cheese. I can take this marriage or leave it, but even if you love it, you must admit that it only scratches the surface of what beets have to offer. More than half the time that I prepare beets, I begin by shredding them in a food processor. After that, you can serve them raw with a simple dressing, or you can stir-fry them in a skillet to brown them slightly, which brings out their sweetness like nothing else. This recipe employs the latter technique (with the addition of sage) then calls for tossing the beets with pasta. A finishing of grated Parmesan is a salty counterpoint to the caramelized sweetness of the beets.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/05/dining/05COOKING-BEETSBUTTERSAGE2/05COOKING-BEETSBUTTERSAGE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday", "keywords": "beets, butter, sage, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 184}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons butter", "1 1/2 pounds beets, peeled and grated", "20 fresh sage leaves", "Cooked pasta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
