{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vietnamese-Style Chicken With Fragrant Rice Noodles", "description": "Nuoc cham, the Vietnamese dipping sauce, does double duty here: As a marinade, it soaks into the chicken as it roasts. And as part of a rich pan sauce for rice noodles, it marries with the chicken juices. Look for rice noodles that are flat and similar in width to linguine, those normally used for pad Thai. Since the noodles are served at room temperature, run them under cool water after boiling to keep them from clumping. Raw snap peas offer a refreshing crunch, and fans of half-sour pickles will enjoy the extra tanginess they add to the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/dining/nuac-cham/nuac-cham-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "noodles, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thighs, pickles, rice noodles, snap peas, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 83}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 721, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "84 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "2043 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons lime juice", "2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "3 tablespoons Asian fish sauce", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "2 tablespoons peeled, minced ginger", "2 tablespoons turbinado sugar", "2 Thai chile peppers, stemmed and minced", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "12 ounces pad Thai rice noodles", "4 ounces snap peas (about 1 cup), strings removed and cut diagonally into 1/4-inch pieces", "1 cup half-sour pickles, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1/4-inch pieces", "1/2 cup chopped basil leaves", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
