{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Harvest Tart With Pumpkin and Peppers", "description": "A savory, olive oil-crusted tart stuffed full of golden, roasted peppers, jammy onions and some freshly grated pumpkin is a great dinner party treat, although it's perfectly wonderful for a family evening repast as well. Salt the pumpkin ahead of time to draw out excess moisture, though if you are pressed for time you can skip this step. To perk up the caramelized intensity of the filling, it is helpful to fold in something zingy like olive or capers, or perhaps a good splash of lemon juice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/harvest-tart-pumpkin-peppers-olives/harvest-tart-pumpkin-peppers-olives-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "fall, winter, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 230}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 382, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "605 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds pumpkin, preferably cheese pumpkin, or butternut squash, peeled, seeded and coarsely grated", "2 1/4 teaspoons fine sea salt", "4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "3/4 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing", "1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch strips", "1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch strips", "1 sweet onion, such as Vidalia, thinly sliced", "1/3 cup chopped pitted black olives (kalamatas are good)", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves", "1 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 garlic clove, minced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "At least 2 hours or the night before baking, toss the pumpkin with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a colander set over a bowl.
