Here, the lacy crevices between the leaves are stuffed with a piquant mix of anchovies, walnuts and Parmesan, giving the sections crunch and a deep savory flavor. Serve them as a light, meatless main course, paired with noodles, rice or crusty bread, or as a hearty side dish to roast chicken or fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/30/dining/25Apperex/merlin_202627353_97ee11f4-6ae4-4dd9-9fcb-bf40347680ed-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cabbage, parmesan, walnut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1156}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium head green cabbage (about 2 1/2 pounds)", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "Salt, as needed", "3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "6 anchovy fillets, minced", "2 fat garlic cloves, finely grated, passed through a garlic press or minced", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed", "2/3 cup chopped walnuts or other nuts,\u00a0such as almonds or hazelnuts", "1/2 cup chopped fresh dill or cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
