{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pastelitos (Guava and Cream Cheese Pastries)", "description": "In Havana \u2014 and in Cuban neighborhoods across the U.S. \u2014 pastry shops make many types of cakes and cookies, but the best-sellers are always the pastels and pastelitos, flaky pastries filled with meat, cheese, coconut custard or guava jam. According to \u201cPaladares: Recipes from the Private Restaurants, Home Kitchens, and Streets of Cuba\u201d by Anya von Bremzen (Abrams, 2017), the shape of the pastel correlates with the filling: Triangular pastels are filled with guava paste and cheese, while rectangular ones are filled with just guava. Versailles, a Cuban restaurant in Miami, follows this rule, but at home, just make them rectangular, and add a swipe of cream cheese if desired. You can find guava paste in bricks at Latin American grocers, or swap in about 1/2 cup jam or preserves for a nontraditional take.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/25/dining/dg-pastelitos/merlin_170458821_b5245c9b-4c00-4433-8d18-d41381b7964e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 pastelitos", "recipeCuisine": "cuban", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, pastries", "keywords": "cream cheese, egg, guava paste, puff pastry, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large egg", "Pinch of kosher salt", "2 sheets frozen puff pastry (about 8 ounces each), defrosted and refrigerated", "All-purpose flour, for rolling", "5 1/2 ounces/160 grams guava paste, cut into 8 even, rectangular slices, or 1/2 cup strawberry jam or other fruit jam or preserves", "3/4 cup/170 grams cream cheese, softened at room temperature (optional)", "2 tablespoons granulated or turbinado sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
