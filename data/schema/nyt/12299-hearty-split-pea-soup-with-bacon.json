Look for split peas that have a use-by date on the package and are relatively fresh; they will cook faster and better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/05/dining/20COOKING-SPLITPEASOUP2/20COOKING-SPLITPEASOUP2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, bacon, split peas, dairy-free, gluten-free, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 769}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 377, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "698 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound slab bacon in 1/4-inch-thick slices", "1 large onion, chopped", "1 carrot, chopped", "1 stalk celery, chopped", "1 head garlic, cloves peeled and sliced thin", "Salt and black pepper", "1 pound dried green split peas, rinsed and picked over", "4 bay leaves", "2 to 3 quarts chicken stock", "1/2 bunch fresh thyme leaves, stripped from stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dice bacon into 1/4-inch cubes.
