There are hundreds of ways to turn this delicious mixture into kibbe, little football-shaped savory treats sold and eaten everywhere and made daily in homes throughout the region. (There are other kinds of kibbe, too, like fish, but that\u2019s another story.) For a less labor-intensive version, kibbe can also be baked like a flat cake. It makes an extraordinarily fragrant meatloaf, adorned with long-cooked caramelized onions and pine nuts, to be eaten hot, warm, cold or reheated.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/21/dining/21KITCH/21KITCH-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "bulgur, ground lamb, pine nuts, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 226}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 437, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "380 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup fine-grain bulgur", "1 pound lamb shoulder, ground fine", "1/4 cup grated onion", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground, or 1 teaspoon ground cumin", "Pinch cayenne pepper", "Salt", "pepper", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for oiling the pan", "2 cups sliced onions, 1/4-inch thick", "1/2 cup pine nuts, lightly toasted", "Greek-style yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the bulgur well, then cover with cold water and soak for 20 minutes.
