(Panzanella didn\u2019t include tomatoes until the 16th century, and earlier versions featured onions as the main vegetable.) Here, scallions crisp up alongside the pan-fried croutons, which get a last-minute candying with maple syrup to provide extra crunch and insurance against sogginess. While the croutons are magnificent and dangerously snackable, the star of this salad is the zucchini. Cooked zucchini tastes wonderful, but the crunch of the raw vegetable in this recipe is stimulating and sweet, especially when doused with the punchy, garlicky dressing.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a> .", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/30/dining/EK-zucchini-panzanella/merlin_193478568_303be82a-4ea7-4d6e-92d3-7c28ba964ed9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "bread, olives, parsley, zucchini, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 765}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 medium zucchini (about 1 pound), trimmed", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "2 packed cups (1/2-inch) cubes of dense, chewy, day-old bread (5 ounces), such as sourdough", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced at an angle (about 2 cups)", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons maple syrup", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon rice vinegar", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1/2 cup Castelvetrano or other green olives, pitted and torn into halves", "1 packed cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice 1 zucchini crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick coins.
