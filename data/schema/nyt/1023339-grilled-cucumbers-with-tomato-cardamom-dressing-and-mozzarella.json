{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Cucumbers With Tomato-Cardamom Dressing and Mozzarella", "description": "Grilling cucumbers gives them a nice charred flavor while retaining their bite. Try to buy Persian cucumbers that are thicker as the thin ones can often be too flimsy to cook. Torn mozzarella adds richness to the cucumbers doused with a garlicky, spiced tomato dressing. (Feel free to cook the cucumbers on an outdoor grill, treating them in the same way.) If you\u2019re into creamy cheeses, then burrata works very well here, too \u2014 or, you could keep this dish vegan by leaving out the mozzarella completely. It will still have a wonderful umami flavor without it. Make this a complete meal by serving alongside your protein of choice.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/17/magazine/17mag-eat-site/17mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 side-dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "cardamom, cucumber, mozzarella, tomatoes, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 368}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces/225 grams datterini or cherry tomatoes", "7 tablespoons olive oil\u00a0", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon white miso", "3 fresh bay leaves", "9 cardamom pods, shells reserved and seeds roughly crushed in a mortar and pestle", "1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika or Kashmiri chile powder", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon lime juice", "1 1/4 pounds/565 grams large Persian cucumbers", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves and soft stems", "1 small ball buffalo mozzarella (about 4 1/2 ounces/125 grams), roughly torn"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start with the dressing: Add the tomatoes, oil, garlic, miso, bay leaves, cardamom shells and seeds, paprika and a heaping \u00bc teaspoon salt to a large (lidded) saut\u00e9 pan.
