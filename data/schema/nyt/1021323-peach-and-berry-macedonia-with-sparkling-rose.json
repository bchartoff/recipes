{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach and Berry Macedonia With Sparkling Ros\u00e9", "description": "Fresh fruit compote always makes a perfect dessert, especially during the summer months, when stone fruits and berries are in season. This recipe relies on peaches, nectarines, blackberries and raspberries, but you could add apricots or cherries, too. Any dry white or ros\u00e9 wine will work, but this Macedonia is especially good with sparkling wine, particularly sparkling ros\u00e9. Serve in wide glasses, so guests can sip the resulting juice. Top up with more bubbly, if you wish. Here, a bit of optional lavender perfumes the fruit, but lemon verbena or mint leaves would also be nice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/19/dining/14Tanisrex-macedonia/14Tanisrex-macedonia-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "parfaits and trifles, dessert", "keywords": "nectarine, peach, sparkling rose, vodka, summer, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds freestone peaches and nectarines, sliced (about 4 cups)", "1/2 pint blackberries", "1/2 pint raspberries", "Granulated sugar, to taste", "2 tablespoons vodka or kirsch", "1 cup sparkling ros\u00e9 (or still ros\u00e9, if preferred)", "1 teaspoon fresh lavender blossoms, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put sliced fruit in a large glass serving bowl.
