{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baghali Ghatogh (Fava Bean Stew)", "description": "A popular and beloved stew from northern Iran, baghali ghatogh is an ambassador of early spring produce. Earthy, bright-green fava beans, fragrant dill and an assertive amount of garlic are combined with eggs for a comforting meal. Although shelling and peeling fresh favas is a rite of passage (see Tip), it\u2019s a time-consuming task, given the amount needed here (but if you have the time, go for it!). Frozen fava beans are a worthy substitute, but if they aren't available, you can use canned butter beans or frozen lima beans. Just enough eggs are used to give the stew some heft, but they shouldn\u2019t overwhelm the vibrant flavors of this verdant stew. The eggs can be incorporated two ways: cracked in and poached, or stirred in to break apart. Baghali ghatogh is typically served over rice with a side of smoked fish and pickled garlic, or with bread.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/dining/nd-baghali-ghatogh/merlin_205954455_f3fc9869-83f5-402b-ac28-81a68c126a64-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, beans, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "dill, eggs, fava beans, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 267}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "5 to 10 large garlic cloves (depending on preference), finely grated\u00a0\u00a0", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "14 ounces double-peeled frozen fava beans, thawed (see Tip), or 2 (15-ounce) cans butter beans, lima beans or cannellini beans, rinsed", "2 large bunches fresh dill (about 8.5 ounces), stems trimmed, finely chopped, or \u00bc cup dried dill", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "3 to 4 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the oil and garlic to a medium pot, then set it over medium-low heat.
