{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Bone-In Rib-Eye Steaks With Blue Cheese", "description": "The usual formula for cooking an amazing slab of steak is as simple as they come: salt plus pepper plus a short stint over a hot fire. But there are times when you want an extra shot of flavor. Some good crumbled blue cheese sprinkled on the hot steak so it melts over the top does just that, especially when you spike it with hot sauce and butter. I like to use a combination of direct and indirect heat when grilling a bone-in piece of meat; it allows a crust to form but not burn while keeping the meat juicy inside. But you know your grill best, so let your instinct guide you as to where to move the steaks and when you think they are done. And if blue cheese isn\u2019t your thing, follow the grilling directions here but leave your meat bare except for the salt and pepper. If you start with good meat, you will never go wrong.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/12/multimedia/clark-steak-cheese/clark-steak-cheese-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops", "keywords": "blue cheese, rib-eye steak, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 178}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (1 1/2-inch-thick) bone-in rib-eye steaks, about 1 1/4 pounds each", "2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "Black pepper, as needed", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed", "2 ounces creamy blue cheese, such as Jasper Hill Bayley Hazen Blue", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 teaspoons finely chopped chives", "Hot sauce, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season steaks with salt and pepper at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour before you plan to cook them.
