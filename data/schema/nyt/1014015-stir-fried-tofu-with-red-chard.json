{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Tofu With Red Chard", "description": "Most of the time that you devote to a stir-fry goes into chopping and measuring out ingredients. Sometimes the list looks long to me, and I fear the dish is going to take forever to make. But while I may spend 30 minutes prepping everything, I\u2019ll spend only five minutes at the stove. For things to go well, it\u2019s important that the mise en place be organized. If liquids are to be added to a dish at the same time, combine them in one bowl or measuring cup. If the garlic and ginger are to be added together, have them minced and combined in a small container. Clean your work area before you start cooking, and have everything close to the stove. Once you begin to stir-fry, you won\u2019t be able to do anything except grab the next ingredient. Read the recipe carefully from beginning to end, have the table set, your rice or noodles cooked and plates ready. I love the pink color that tofu takes on when cooked with red chard. Beet greens would also do the trick. In this recipe, blanching the greens is part of the prep.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/09/14/health/14recipehealth_600/14recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "firm tofu, red chard, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 62}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 233, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "754 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon chopped or grated fresh ginger", "3/4 pound firm tofu, sliced 1/2 inch thick, into 1- by 2-inch dominoes", "1 large bunch or 2 smaller bunches red chard about 1 1/2 pounds, stemmed and thoroughly cleaned retain the stems", "Salt to taste", "1 teaspoon dark sesame oil", "2 tablespoons canola or peanut oil", "2 large garlic cloves, minced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix together the soy sauce, 1 teaspoon of the ginger and the sugar.
