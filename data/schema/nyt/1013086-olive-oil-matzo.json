Something about its ethereal nature made me assume that it would be too difficult. Turns out, making this bread is a snap, and the dough has such a high percentage of olive oil that rolling it super-thin is almost no work at all. The dough is a joy to work with. It\u2019s almost impossible to tear and, with a minimum of additional flour, is stick-free. Baking takes a bit of practice because the oven must be heated to reach a very high temperature before the dough is inserted. The last few breads will bake a bit faster than the first few because the baking sheet will be hot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/matzo-still/matzo-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, flour, olive oil, kosher, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 80}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 129, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "62 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/3 cup olive oil", "Sea salt, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 500 degrees.
