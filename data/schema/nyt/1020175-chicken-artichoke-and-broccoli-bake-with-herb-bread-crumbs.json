{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken, Artichoke and Broccoli Bake With Herb Bread Crumbs", "description": "This one-dish dinner is indeed a casserole \u2014 but it\u2019s bright and light, and nearly effortless. Toss canned artichokes with capers, garlic and chicken stock, pour over chicken breasts and broccoli florets, then let the oven do the work. Canned artichokes are the main flavor builder here so opt for the firmer water-packed variety, which hold their shape better during cooking. While the casserole bakes, toast the panko bread crumbs and season them with dill. Serve the chicken with a squeeze of lemon for brightness and a sprinkle of herby bread crumbs for crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/dining/kc-chicken-and-artichoke/merlin_151400640_0b036e33-6417-414c-9055-dff9d5e3713d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, casseroles, poultry", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, capers, cauliflower, chicken breast, dill, lemon, panko, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 336}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1\u00bd to 2 pounds total)", "1 small head broccoli (about 1 pound), tough stem discarded, head cut into 2-inch florets (about 4 cups)", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 (14-ounce) cans quartered artichoke hearts in water, drained (about 4 cups)", "1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
