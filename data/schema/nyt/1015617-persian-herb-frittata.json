It\u2019s not the list of ingredients, which sound fresh and lovely with heaps of parsley, cilantro, scallions and lettuce. It\u2019s the last line, Step No. 4, which calls for cooking one side of the frittata 40 minutes, then flipping it over, and cooking the other side 40 more minutes. \n\nIn the interminable 80 minutes that it cooks, several things happen. The vegetables give up their moisture, the frittata shrinks in height by two-thirds, and the outside becomes a slightly crisp, dark, golden brown \u2014 without burning.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Elaine Louie"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 large appetizers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "eggs, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 45}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 476, "unsaturatedFatContent": "34 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "470 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup barberries", "1 cup (about 4 ounces) chopped parsley", "1 cup (about 4 ounces) chopped cilantro", "1 cup (about 4 ounces) chopped scallions, white part only", "2/3 cups (about 6 large leaves) chopped romaine lettuce", "4 large eggs", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons black pepper", "1/2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup olive oil", "Yogurt for serving, optional."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, soak the barberries in cold water for 20 minutes.
