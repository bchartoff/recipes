{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cannellini-Bean Pasta With Beurre Blanc", "description": "This recipe, like so many great straightforward, inexpensive go-tos, starts with little more than a can of beans \u2014 then transforms it into a luxurious meal. Jack Monroe, the British food writer, uses a classic beurre blanc to do that work, simmering a splash of wine, vinegar and butter together, then tipping it into a pot of boiling beans and pasta, letting the liquid reduce to a starchy, nearly creamy consistency. If you think of beurre blanc as fancy and fussy, this simple, unexpected use for it may change your mind. You can also build on the basic recipe, adding a bunch of chopped chard or mustard greens in with the sauce, or covering the top with torn herbs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/magazine/27mag-eat-02/27mag-eat-02-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, beans, noodles, pastas", "keywords": "butter, cannellini beans, chicken broth, pasta shells, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1874}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed", "3 cups chicken or vegetable stock", "1/4 cup white wine", "1/4 cup white wine vinegar", "1 shallot or small white onion, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup small pasta, like shells", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Grated Parmesan, Pecorino Romano or other strong hard cheese, to finish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the beans and stock to a large pot, and bring to a boil.
