{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shaking Beef", "description": "This savory-sweet stir-fry, known as bo luc lac or \u201cdice\u201d in Vietnamese, gets its English name from the constant shaking of the pan performed by the cook while browning the meat. It can be tough work to move the hot wok constantly, and the intense heat can burn the ingredients in a wink. This recipe, adapted from the one served at Slanted Door, Charles Phan\u2019s immensely popular Vietnamese restaurant in San Francisco, has been simplified for the home cook. Once the meat is marinated, it is quick work \u2013 20 minutes from start to finish \u2013 but don\u2019t try to expedite matters further by dumping all of the meat into the wok at once. Cook the meat in two batches (a pound at a time) so you get a nice, crisp sear.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-SHAKINGBEEF/19COOKING-SHAKINGBEEF-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, times classics", "keywords": "beef, beef tenderloin, fish sauce, lime, red onion, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, watercress, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 474}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 626, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1123 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef tenderloin (filet mignon), trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons chopped garlic", "2 tablespoons sugar", "Salt and pepper", "5 tablespoons neutral oil, like corn or canola", "1/4 cup rice-wine vinegar", "1/4 cup rice or white wine", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "1 red onion, peeled and sliced thin", "3 scallions, trimmed and cut in 1-inch lengths", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 bunches watercress, washed and dried, or 1 head red leaf lettuce, washed, dried and separated into leaves", "2 limes, cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate meat with garlic, half the sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and 1 tablespoon oil for about 2 hours.
