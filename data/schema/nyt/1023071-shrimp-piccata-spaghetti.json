{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp Piccata Spaghetti", "description": "The zesty piccata sauce of fresh lemon juice, briny capers and rich butter is the inspiration behind this weeknight seafood pasta. Plump, meaty shrimp pair perfectly with the pantry-staple sauce, which is simple yet fresh and bright. The chopped shrimp are gently cooked over low heat in a shallot and garlic-infused olive oil to keep them tender. Peas are an easy way to add a vegetable with pops of sweetness. (Thawed frozen corn would also work well.) The dish is finished with fresh parsley, but other herbs like basil, chives or dill would yield equally delicious results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/kc-shrimp-piccata-spaghetti/merlin_202696317_39223c7d-c01e-4044-869f-fcf096680130-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, pastas, seafood, main course", "keywords": "capers, shallot, shrimp, spaghetti", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1847}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound spaghetti", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 medium shallot, finely chopped (1/2 cup)", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 pound cleaned medium shrimp, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 cup thawed frozen peas", "2 tablespoons capers, plus 2 tablespoons caper brine", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high.
