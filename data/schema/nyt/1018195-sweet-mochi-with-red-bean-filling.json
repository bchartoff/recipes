{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Mochi With Red Bean Filling", "description": "Nothing compares to the texture of fresh mochi, the sweet, delightfully chewy Japanese rice dough. And when you make it yourself (which takes about 10 minutes), you can really enjoy it fresh, at the peak of its textural pleasures. Chop up the cooled mochi and toss it in roasted soybean flour, and it's ready to go as a sweet snack or ice cream topping. Or, as in this recipe, put in some extra time and wrap the sticky dough around a simple red bean filling to make daifuku. The pastry chef Tomoko Kato uses shiratamako flour processed in Japan, but mochiko flour can be easier to find, and the results are similar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/06/dining/06MOCHI-SUB-WEB/06MOCHI-SUB-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "20 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, dried azuki beans, mochiko flour, potato starch, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 102}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 88, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "30 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/200 grams dried azuki beans", "3/4 cup/150 grams sugar", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "Potato starch, for dusting", "1 cup/150 grams mochiko flour (also known as sweet rice flour or glutinous rice flour)", "3/4 cup/150 grams sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the filling:\u00a0Rinse the beans and transfer to a large pot.

(If eating plain, or as an ice cream topping, cut into 40 to 50 smaller pieces.) One at a time, use a rolling pin to roll a piece of mochi dough into a thick, flat disk about 2 inches by 2 inches. Use potato starch liberally to keep the dough from sticking to your work surface, the rolling pin or your fingers. Roll a scant tablespoon of bean paste between your hands to form a ball and place it in the center of the rolled-out dough piece. Use your fingers to evenly stretch the mochi dough up and around the filling without squishing it, pinching the dough shut at the top to seal it, and then gently rolling the mochi between your hands to form a rounded shape. Set on the parchment-lined baking sheet with the seam on the bottom. Eat the filled mochi the day they\u2019re made, or cover and store in the refrigerator for 1 day."}]}
