Feel free to substitute any cooked grain for the quinoa: Brown rice or millet would work just as well as a base for the roasted brussels sprouts with their blackened edges, and the soft, velvety eggplant. If you love tahini dressing, consider doubling it. Any left over will keep for a week in the fridge and can be used as a salad dressing or dip.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/31/dining/lessmeatrex-bowl/merlin_166281711_a1e3cfc8-9587-49b6-b382-6e5579e00a0d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice, vegetables", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, eggplant, quinoa, tahini, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 523}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3 tablespoons tahini", "1 pound brussels sprouts, cleaned and trimmed (halved if they\u2019re larger than 1 inch)", "1 1/2 pounds eggplant, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 cup quinoa", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon honey or agave syrup", "Large pinch of red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "1 cup cherry tomatoes, quartered", "Fresh mint leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the tahini dressing: Whisk together lemon juice, garlic and salt in a medium bowl.
