As Diaz notes in her book, the effort is greatly rewarded \u2014 fresh coconut milk is infinitely more complex, floral and delicious than the kind that comes in a can. Mature coconuts, the ones ideal for making coconut milk, should be brown, hairy and very heavy. If you shake them around, you should be able to hear the water inside. (That said, you can absolutely use canned if you like; just cut the sugar back to a half cup.)<strong></strong>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/24/magazine/24Eat1/24Eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 10", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "coconut, orange blossom water, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 70}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 718, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "16 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "54 grams", "sodiumContent": "131 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds coconut (about 1 or 2 whole mature coconuts, or 2 cups fresh coconut meat)", "1/2\u00a0cup cornstarch", "2/3\u00a0cup sugar", "1/2\u00a0teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon orange-blossom water", "Ground cinnamon, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make fresh coconut milk, extract the coconut water and coconut meat from the coconut: Hammer a screwdriver into the coconut\u2019s three eyes, and pour the coconut water through a fine-mesh strainer into a blender.
