{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet and Spicy Pan-Seared Pork Chops", "description": "Simple pork chops taste luxurious when they\u2019re draped in ginger butter and a sticky-sweet whiskey sauce. The ingredient list here is minimal thanks to unsulphured molasses, a natural byproduct of sugar processing. It delivers an intriguing sweetness that is smoky, bitter and savory \u2014 like honey, chicory, coffee and soy sauce in one ingredient. And, in this recipe, it melds with whiskey and ginger to add warmth and spice, as well as brown sugar and butter to soften the assertive edges. Serve these chops with roasted carrots, mashed sweet potatoes or grits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/07/multimedia/as-spicy-sweet-pork-chops-1-b457/as-spicy-sweet-pork-chops-1-b457-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, quick, weeknight, meat, main course", "keywords": "date night, fresh ginger, molasses, pork chop, skillet, whiskey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 274}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (1- to 1\u00bd-inch-thick) bone-in pork rib chops, patted very dry", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon light brown sugar", "Salt", "\u00bc cup whiskey or apple cider vinegar", "3 tablespoons unsulphured molasses (see Tip)", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger, thinly sliced and smashed, plus 1 teaspoon peeled and finely grated", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Coat the pork chops with 1 teaspoon brown sugar, and sprinkle generously with salt.
