{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banana Snacking Cake With Salted Caramel Glaze", "description": "This buttery snacking cake is a bit like banana bread, but richer, and topped with a sticky caramel frosting that is dotted with crunchy flakes of sea salt. The frosting, made from brown sugar and heavy cream, is easier than a classic caramel, but just as compelling, with the sea salt contrasting perfectly with its sweetness. It\u2019s important to use ripe bananas here. Soft, spotty ones with dark yellow skins will be the sweetest and most complex. Firm, pale yellow bananas just don\u2019t have enough intensity to flavor the cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/13/dining/08Apperex-bananacake1/merlin_150934491_2f4b501a-7c46-47ae-b2b3-b81e806fda80-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "banana, heavy cream, sour cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 487}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 269, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "194 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted, plus more for pan", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "1 cup/250 grams mashed banana (from 2 to 3 very ripe bananas)", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters sour cream", "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "4 tablespoons/65 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), cut into pieces", "1/3 packed cup/70 grams dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy cream", "Large pinch of fine sea salt", "1/4 cup/30 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
