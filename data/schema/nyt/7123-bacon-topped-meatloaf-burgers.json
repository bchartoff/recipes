{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bacon-Topped Meatloaf Burgers", "description": "Instead of turning a meatloaf into a red-centered burger-loaf, why not turn a burger into a tender, juicy meatloaf patty? You get the inimitable meatloaf flavors of beef laced with ketchup and onion but in a far more delectable form. Simply broil the burgers until they are just past purple on the inside, and seared mahogany brown on the outside. This takes about five minutes \u2014 55 minutes less than a traditional meatloaf. Put the patties on a potato bun and bite in. The meat is juicy enough to soak the roll, and is flavored in that meatloaf manner \u2014 brawny yet barely sweet, porky from the bacon, aromatic with herbs, onion and garlic, all commingled with a deep, beefy flavor. Excellent!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 burgers", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, burgers", "keywords": "bacon, beef, buns, dijon mustard, ground beef, ketchup, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 21}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 429, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "409 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons ketchup", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce", "1 1/2 pounds ground beef, or a combination of beef, pork and veal", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "6 slices bacon, cut into thirds crosswise", "Burger buns and trimmings like pickles, tomato, lettuce and mayonnaise, if desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat broiler.
