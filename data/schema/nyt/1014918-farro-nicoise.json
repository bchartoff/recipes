{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro Ni\u00e7oise", "description": "There is one mistake many of us make, cooking grain salads: we play down everything but the grains. A pile of cold brown rice with a few chopped vegetables and some soy sauce or a mound of wheat berries with vinaigrette is about as one-dimensional as it gets. This ni\u00e7oise salad turns that problem on its head, with tuna used in a powerful vinaigrette tossed with farro. Farro is interesting because it\u2019s relatively fast-cooking for a whole grain, but any hearty grain could take its place: one of the many \u201cbrown\u201d rices, spelt, kamut, wheat. Whichever you use, the results are nutty and sublime.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/24/dining/24FLEX1/24JPFLEX1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "farro, tuna, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 167}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 558, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1019 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup farro ", "Salt", "1 pound green beans, trimmed", "3 anchovy fillets", "1/3 cup olive oil, plus more if needed", "Zest of 1 lemon ", "Juice of 2 lemons, plus more if needed", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 shallot, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 tablespoon capers", "1 6-ounce can good tuna in olive oil", "1/2 cup parsley leaves", "Ground black pepper", "3 ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges", "4 hard-cooked eggs, halved", "1/2 cup ni\u00e7oise or other black olives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the farro and a large pinch salt in a medium saucepan with water to cover by about an inch.
