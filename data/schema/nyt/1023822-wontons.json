And not all wontons are Cantonese \u2014 there are thicker-skinned versions in northern China and spicy ones from Sichuan in the southwest, among others \u2014 but Hong Kong wontons, distinguished by silky wrappers and shrimp in the stuffing, are arguably the most delicious and nuanced. In Cantonese cooking, the inherent flavors of ingredients are meant to shine, so this formula seasons the shrimp and pork lightly with classic sauces, ginger and scallions. The filling can be varied to your tastes: You can add diced water chestnuts for crunch, chopped rehydrated dried shiitake or other Chinese mushrooms for their meatiness, or swap minced fish or scallops for the pork.

Using your fingertip, wet the wrapper corner nearest the filling, then fold that corner over the filling to enclose it, pleating the wrapper around the filling and pressing that corner just past the center of the remaining wrapper.
