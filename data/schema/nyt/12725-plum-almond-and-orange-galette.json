{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Plum, Almond and Orange Galette", "description": "The galette is a free-form French tart that is effortlessly chic, the kind of dish whose imperfections can render it that much more perfect. It makes an exceptionally good showcase for fruit at the height of the season, as with the plums of late August and early September. Orange zest adds wonderful perfume. Typically, buttery doughs are used in galettes, but this recipe calls for a yeasted dough that is not too heavy or rich, a mixture of white and whole-wheat flour (add almond flour for nutty flavor), with significantly less butter. You can use another dough recipe if you like, though, and just heap on this plum filling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/28/science/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, halal, healthy, kosher, low-sodium, vegetarian, plum, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 27}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 127, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "16 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/12722/Dessert-Galette-Pastry.html\">dessert galette pastry (1/2 recipe)</a>", "1 1/2 pounds plums, pitted and sliced", "3 tablespoons raw brown sugar or 2 tablespoons mild honey, like clover", "3 tablespoons finely chopped walnuts", "Finely chopped zest of 1 orange, preferably organic", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon cinnamon", "25 grams (1/4 cup) almond powder (almond flour)", "1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon milk, for egg wash ", "1 tablespoon raw brown sugar (if using honey with the fruit)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the pastry from the freezer and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment.
