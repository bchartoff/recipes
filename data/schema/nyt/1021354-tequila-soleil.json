The vermouth \u2014 use blanc if you have it, sweet red if you don\u2019t \u2014 tempers the drink, but the key to a perfectly balanced Tequila Soleil lies in how you build it. Namely, you\u2019ll want to add the ice last. This small switch in technique has a big impact, keeping the beer from deflating on impact and thus retaining a bubbly, refreshing vibe for much longer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/19/dining/13beerrex-tequila/merlin_175613265_96696888-5649-4c43-bc0f-db0dcc912d49-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "beer, campari, tequila, vermouth, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 569}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 ounce reposado tequila", "1/2 ounce red bitter liqueur, such as Campari, Cappelletti or Contratto Bitter", "1/2 ounce blanc or sweet red vermouth", "4 to 6 ounces I.P.A.
