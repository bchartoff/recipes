{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Salad With Corn, Quinoa and Yogurt Dressing", "description": "While traditional <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018211-best-chicken-salad?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=12\">chicken salad</a> is rich with tender meat and mayonnaise, this one embraces pops of texture and color. Combining quinoa and corn, two staples in Inca, Aymara and Quechua cooking, is a great balancing act of earthy and sweet. For this salad\u2019s dressing, mashing onion and chile together with salt (like in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021293-chile-verde-guacamole?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=11\">guacamole</a>) releases their assertive juices into a tangy blend of Greek yogurt and lime. Since this is a room temperature salad, you can make the chicken and quinoa and reserve them up to a few days ahead, or let the whole salad meld for up to 3 days in the fridge. Eat the dish on its own, over romaine or Little Gem leaves, or with more pops, such as pepitas, mint, radishes, jicama, Cotija or Parmesan.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/22/dining/as-chicken-quinoa-salad-1/merlin_211376385_26c70d4a-cbb2-41f5-b608-57933306e846-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings (8 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, chicken salad, corn, make-ahead, quinoa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 64}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 \u00bd to 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts\u00a0", "4 ears of corn, kernels removed, cobs reserved", "1 large red or white onion, halved", "1 jalape\u00f1o, halved", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 lime, zested and juiced", "1 cup quinoa (preferably tricolor)", "1/4 cup full-fat Greek yogurt", "Romaine or Little Gem lettuce (optional), for serving", "Any combination of pepitas, mint, radishes, jicama, Cotija or Parmesan to garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, combine the chicken breasts, corn cobs, 1/2 onion and 1/2 jalape\u00f1o.
