As the chicken thighs roast, the cumin-scented rice soaks up all of the delicious juices. When the timer chimes, the rice and chicken emerge from the oven perfectly cooked. Be sure to use a 12-inch skillet here; a smaller or larger pan might result in under- or overcooked chicken or rice. Leftovers, if you have any, are great in tacos or enchiladas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/dining/ml-chicken-and-black-beans/merlin_160015383_4bd71410-dc4f-487f-92e6-c664995b50e0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, casseroles, grains and rice, one pot, poultry", "keywords": "black beans, chicken thighs, cumin, jalape\u00f1o, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 747}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "Flaky sea salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or peanut oil", "1 large yellow or white onion, chopped", "2 green or red bell peppers, halved, seeded and sliced", "2 1/2 cups chicken stock", "2 red Fresno chiles or jalape\u00f1os, halved, seeded and chopped", "1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick, broken in half", "3 garlic cloves, finely grated", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed", "1/3 pound cherry tomatoes, halved", "1 cup basmati rice, rinsed in a sieve until the water runs clear", "3 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves", "Lime wedges, pickled chiles, sliced fresh chiles, sour cream and sliced avocado, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
