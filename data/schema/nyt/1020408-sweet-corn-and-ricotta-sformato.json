This one is fluffy and rich at the same time. A cheesy base of ricotta, Parmesan and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is combined with a double dose of corn: whole kernels and a pur\u00e9e. Lightness and rise comes from egg whites, whipped to stiff peaks and folded through right before cooking. Make sure your eaters are assembled at the table when you pull this out of the oven. It\u2019s best eaten immediately, still puffed up and drizzled with crushed basil oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": ""}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/28/dining/27Diaryrex3/27Diaryrex3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "basil, corn, eggs, ricotta, main course, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 297}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing", "6 ears fresh corn, kernels removed (about 5 cups kernels), cobs discarded", "2 tablespoons flaky sea salt, plus more to taste", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 cups fresh ricotta", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "2 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream", "1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan", "4 large eggs, whites and yolks separated", "Coarsely ground black pepper", "1/3 packed cup fresh basil leaves (about 20 leaves)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1/2 lemon)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat.
