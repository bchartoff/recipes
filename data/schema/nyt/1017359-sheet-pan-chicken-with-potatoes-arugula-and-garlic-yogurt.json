{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Potatoes, Arugula and Garlic Yogurt", "description": "Your typical sheet-pan chicken recipe roasts everything together on a pan at once. This version pairs potatoes with the poultry, and tops everything off with fresh herbs and arugula, making it a true one-pan meal, salad included. A savory yogurt sauce adds a creamy touch, but it\u2019s optional if you\u2019re not a yogurt sauce fan. Feel free to double the recipe if you\u2019re feeding a crowd, though make sure to use two sheet pans so that everything is spread out in one layer, which is critical for browning.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/21/dining/sheet-pan-chicken/sheet-pan-chicken-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, roasts", "keywords": "arugula, chicken drumsticks, leek, yukon gold potato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 5066}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds chicken thighs and drumsticks", "1 1/4 pounds small Yukon Gold potatoes, halved and cut into 1/2-inch slices", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, more as needed", "2 tablespoons harissa (or use another thick hot sauce, such as sriracha)", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "4 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "2 leeks, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest (from 1/2 lemon)", "1/3 cup plain yogurt (do not use Greek yogurt)", "1 small garlic clove", "2 ounces baby arugula", "Chopped fresh dill, as needed", "Lemon juice, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine chicken and potatoes in a large bowl.
