Made with high-quality, oil-packed tuna, the salad is fresh, juicy, bright and summery, composed with cucumbers, avocado, pickled onion and lots of herbs. Don\u2019t be afraid to season the cucumbers generously with salt at the start, and to season more as you build the layers of the salad. The dish is so simple that seasoning it well is key.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/22/magazine/22mag-Eat-image1/22mag-Eat-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 as a side or 2 as dinner", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weeknight, salads and dressings", "keywords": "avocado, canned tuna, cucumber, rice-wine vinegar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 674}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 311, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "660 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup rice-wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon sugar", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 red onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced", "3 Persian cucumbers, peeled if skin is thick and waxy, sliced about 1/4-inch thick", "2 spring onions, thinly sliced", "2 limes, juiced, about 1/4 cup", "5 to 7 ounces olive-oil-packed tuna", "1 avocado, peeled and cubed", "1/2 teaspoon or more finishing salt, such as Maldon", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "Handful basil leaves, washed and torn", "Handful cilantro sprigs, washed and torn", "Handful fresh mint leaves, washed and torn", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a clean glass jar with a tightfitting lid, mix vinegar, sugar and 1 teaspoon kosher salt with 1/2 cup hot water.
