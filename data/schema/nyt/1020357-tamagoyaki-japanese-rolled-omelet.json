{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tamagoyaki (Japanese Rolled Omelet)", "description": "Tamagoyaki, a Japanese staple, is made by carefully rolling several thin layers of cooked egg into a rectangular omelet, which creates a soft and delicate texture. Traditionally, it\u2019s made in a special tamagoyaki pan, but this version also works with an 8-inch nonstick skillet. There are sweet and savory variations, and this recipe falls somewhere in between the two: The soy sauce, mirin and dashi pack it with umami, while the sugar adds a subtle sweetness. The technique can be challenging at first, but do your best to keep each layer consistent in color and each fold parallel to the last. Don\u2019t worry about little tears; they\u2019ll be covered up with the next layer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kiera Wright-Ruiz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/16/dining/kwr-tamagoyaki/kwr-tamagoyaki-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, for one, for two, lunch, snack, weekday", "keywords": "dashi, egg, mirin, soy sauce, sugar, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 139}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 eggs", "1 tablespoon mirin", "1 tablespoon white soy sauce or 1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce", "1 tablespoon dashi stock, optional (see Tip)", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon neutral oil, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine eggs, mirin, soy sauce, dashi (if using) and sugar.
