{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Cakes", "description": "In the \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d book series (later known on television as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d), George R.R. Martin devotes a lot of ink to lemon cakes, a favorite of the Lady of Winterfell Sansa Stark. The cakes have since become a pop culture totem for fans of the series. This recipe is inspired by a version found in \u201cA Feast of Ice and Fire: The Official Game of Thrones Companion Cookbook\u201d by Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Sariann Lehrer. You don\u2019t need to be a fan of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to love these cookielike treats, which are dense in texture, bright in flavor and boast a tart-sweet lemon glaze. The cakes are easy to throw together for a potluck or to satisfy a teatime craving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/06/dining/05COOKBOOKSREX/merlin_195359535_776d0181-27ca-47d3-879e-ede26088be44-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "About 32 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "butter, lemon, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 612}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 2/3 cups/226 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/170 grams granulated sugar", "6 tablespoons/85 grams salted butter", "2 lemons", "1 large egg", "2 large egg yolks", "1/3 cup/41 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
