{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skirt Steak Bulgogi", "description": "Neobiani, a dish of broad, thin slices of beef tenderized with shallow slits from a knife, was a feature of royal court cuisine during the Joseon dynasty in Korea (1392 to 1910) and a predecessor to today\u2019s beloved bulgogi of very thinly sliced marinated grilled meat. This variation borrows from neobani, but doesn\u2019t require knife skills: Well-marbled skirt steak is pounded thin and marinated in a tenderizing sweet pur\u00e9e of Asian pear, onion, soy sauce and maple syrup. Bulgogi, which means \u201cfire meat,\u201d is best with the flame-licked char from a grill, but a hot skillet on the stovetop would work in a pinch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/28/dining/23bulgogi-rex-skirt-steak/merlin_190467228_f7fce523-aefc-4318-b616-02cdd422079e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "steaks and chops", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 607}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds skirt steak, cut into 4-inch-long pieces", "1 medium Asian pear or Fuji apple (about 8 ounces), peeled, cored and chopped", "1 cup chopped yellow onion, plus 1 large yellow onion, cut into \u00bd-inch-thick rounds", "10 large garlic cloves, peeled", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup maple syrup", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "2 bunches scallions", "Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola, for grilling", "Steamed white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a large cutting board, pound the steak until it is 1/8-inch thick using a meat mallet or heavy skillet.
