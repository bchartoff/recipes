{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Grits With Mushrooms and Chard", "description": "In an ode to her Black, Mexican and Haitian backgrounds, the chef Rahanna Bisseret Martinez created this recipe, which honors one of the Americas\u2019s most important ingredients: corn. Corn grits cooked with unsweetened oat-milk cream act as a base for tender swiss chard leaves, pickled chard stems and mushrooms. Soaked then caramelized in a jalape\u00f1o sauce, the mushrooms create layers of varying textures along with the greens. This dish can be served on its own as a hearty one-plate vegan meal, or alongside a main dish or with a crisp and lightly dressed green salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Korsha Wilson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/06/dining/04TERRYREX3-creamy-grits-mushrooms-chard/merlin_195254079_eb32b8f5-c51f-4abe-b053-2a461089a1c5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "grits, mushroom, swiss chard, kwanzaa, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 432}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup grits, preferably organic (see Tip)", "1/4 cup unsweetened oat-milk cream (or coconut, nut or soy cream)", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 unpeeled yellow onion", "1 jalape\u00f1o", "3 unpeeled garlic cloves", "1 teaspoon lemon juice", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup chopped cilantro", "8 ounces maitake or cremini mushrooms", "1 bunch rainbow chard", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed, avocado or canola", "Salt and pepper", "1 jalape\u00f1o", "1 cup distilled white vinegar", "1 garlic clove", "1/4 yellow onion", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar or maple syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the grits: Cook the grits with water according to the package instructions in a large, heavy-bottomed pot, stirring occasionally and adding more water if needed to ensure no grits stick to the pot.
