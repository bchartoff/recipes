{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jamaican Beef Patties", "description": "New Yorkers love their hand-helds. The folded pizza slice, the hot dog and the crusty knish have a built-in mobility that lets hungry New Yorkers eat on the street, and enough density to carry them through to the next meal.\n\nNew immigrants have added to the on-the-go family, introducing Colombian arepas, Mexican tacos and Uzbek samsas. But the hand-held with the best shot at making the list of classic New York noshes is the Jamaican beef patty, a rectangle of flaky yellow crust filled with ground beef shot through with onion, thyme and the inimitable heat and perfume of Scotch bonnet chili peppers.\n\nThe patties are familiar to New Yorkers who order bland commercial versions sold at numerous pizzerias. But they cannot compare to the fresh, handcrafted patties found at a handful of Jamaican bakeries here. The flakiest crusts are still made with a hefty percentage of beef suet, and the most memorable fillings are unabashedly hot.\n\nThe Jamaican patty is served wrapped in coco bread, which is like an oversize, slightly sweet hamburger bun. It is called coco bread not because it contains coconut (it doesn't), but because you split it open like a coconut. Although the combination first appears dauntingly starchy, the soft sweetness of the bread nicely offsets the spicy filling and the crisp crust.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin And Kim Severson"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 patties", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "beef suet, chili pepper, ground beef, scallion, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 64}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 313, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "179 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons salt", "2 teaspoons turmeric", "1 teaspoon curry powder, preferably West Indian", "1 \u00bd cups cold vegetable shortening or chopped beef suet (about 12 ounces)", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "5 scallions, finely chopped", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "4 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 Scotch bonnet chili pepper, seeded and finely chopped", "\u00bd teaspoon paprika", "\u00bc teaspoon ground allspice", "1 pound ground beef, about 80 percent lean", "2 teaspoons thyme leaves", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon sugar", "Coco bread, hamburger buns or soft potato buns, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix flour, salt, turmeric and curry powder in a large bowl.
