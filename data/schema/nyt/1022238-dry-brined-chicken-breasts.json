{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dry-Brined Chicken Breasts", "description": "A short, simple dry brine can take a pallid chicken breast from bland to glam. Dark brown sugar is especially welcome since its molasses provides additional moisture. Dried bay leaves, ground to a powder, lend an aromatic woodsiness that will make you think, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what bay leaves taste like.\u201d But it\u2019s the salt here that\u2019s most crucial, as it draws out the meat\u2019s water. That water then dissolves the salt and, through diffusion, the two reenter the meat, seasoning the chicken thoroughly and encouraging water retention during cooking. You can enjoy it right out of the skillet with a spritz of lime juice or save it to serve in salads, sandwiches, fried rice and the like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/02/dining/04Chickenrex1/merlin_188172984_99fa449e-3c26-49d5-bf55-3a6f148960a2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, chicken breast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 692}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 dried bay leaves, crushed into small pieces", "1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 packed tablespoon dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons garlic powder", "2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds total)", "Vegetable oil", "Lime wedges, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a spice grinder, blitz the bay leaf pieces and peppercorns until finely ground.

Flip the chicken, cover the pan and cook until the other sides are browned and the internal temperature at the thickest part of the meat reaches 155 degrees, another 5 to 7 minutes.
