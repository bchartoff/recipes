{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Taktouka With Burrata and Lime-Parsley Oil", "description": "Taktouka is a Moroccan cooked salad traditionally made of bell peppers simmered in a tomato sauce that\u2019s seasoned with sweet paprika and cumin. The end result is a lightly fragrant and flavorful dish that is typically served with plenty of bread. Here, it is also served with burrata. Although the addition of the creamy cheese is not traditional, it makes taktouka a complete vegetarian meal. The optional addition of lime-parsley oil adds a touch of acidity and freshness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nargisse Benkabbou"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/14/dining/nb-Taktouka/merlin_194732442_e29a916e-0efa-4686-a650-060c3ee671a4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "burrata, cumin, paprika, pepper, tomato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 308}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "5 San Marzano or Roma tomatoes (about 1 pound), deseeded and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces\u00a0", "3 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped", "1/2 packed cup flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped\u00a0", "1/3 packed cup cilantro, finely chopped\u00a0", "2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "3 large green or yellow bell peppers (about 1 pound), deseeded and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces", "8 to 10 ounces burrata (1 or 2 balls), drained, at room temperature", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "Zest of 2 limes (about 4 teaspoons)\u00a0\u00a0", "2 tablespoons lime juice\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic (or 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder or 1 garlic clove, finely chopped)", "1/2 teaspoon dried parsley (or 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley)", "Generous pinch of granulated sugar\u00a0", "Pinch of fine salt\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan and add the chopped tomatoes, garlic, parsley, cilantro, paprika, cumin, salt, sugar and 2 tablespoons of water."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir the ingredients together, cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes or until the tomatoes begin to soften.
