{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Granola Bites", "description": "These chewy-crunchy, salty-sweet breakfast balls are great for eating on the go because they don\u2019t crumble and leave a mess. They take minutes to blend and a few more to roll, but if you make them a friends-and-family cooking project, the process can go even faster. Feel free to experiment here. You can swap out the almonds for cashews, the cherries for other dried fruits, and the sunflower seeds for shelled pumpkin seeds. Just keep the dates and make sure they're Medjool, which are softer and more thin-skinned than other varieties. The dates are the glue that hold the other ingredients together.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/dining/ko-granola-balls-horizontal/ko-granola-balls-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, snack, cookies and bars, grains and rice", "keywords": "almond, cherries, coconut, dates, oats, sunflower seeds, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 156}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 111, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "41 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 packed cup/205 grams pitted, stemmed Medjool dates", "1 cup/140 grams roasted, salted almonds", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters maple syrup", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/75 grams dried cherries\u00a0", "1/2 cup/45 grams\u00a0old-fashioned\u00a0oats", "1/2 cup/70 grams raw\u00a0shelled\u00a0sunflower seeds", "1/3 cup/35 grams unsweetened finely shredded coconut"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a work surface or baking sheet with parchment or wax paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pulse dates, almonds, maple syrup, vanilla and salt in a food processor until the mixture forms big sticky clumps.
