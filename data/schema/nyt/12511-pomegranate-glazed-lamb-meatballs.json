She created a selection of drinks, and let them inspire a group of snacks. Among them was this dish, lamb meatballs with a pomegranate glaze, which paired elegantly with the grenadine of an <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12516-el-presidente\">El Presidente cocktail.</a> But they\u2019re just as nice without the cocktail. Have them alone, as a light snack or part of an evening of tapas, or pair them with some couscous and goat cheese for a larger meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/13/dining/13APPE3_FOOD/13APPE3_FOOD-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen meatballs, or about 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "appetizer, dairy-free, lamb, pomegranate molasses, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 258}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground lamb", "1 small clove garlic, minced", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Olive oil, for brushing", "3 tablespoons pomegranate molasses", "Chopped fresh mint, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, knead together the lamb, garlic, salt, orange zest and pepper until combined.
