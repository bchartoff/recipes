Not only do mushrooms sear well, but they\u2019re also a friend to the dish\u2019s main flavorings of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020551-mushroom-bread-pudding\">heavy cream</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021140-memphis-dry-rub-mushrooms\">heady spices</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017085-dijon-and-cognac-beef-stew\">warming liquor</a>. For the best results, crisp the mushrooms first in a hot pan, baste them with garlic butter until tender, then let them simmer in the cream sauce so they soak up that richness. Eat with roasted, mashed or fried potatoes, a salad of watercress or another spicy green, and red wine, of course.\n\nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/15/dining/as-portobello-steak-au-poivre/merlin_198057798_c4827914-da0c-4dff-9a88-054596c494af-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "black pepper, cognac, dijon mustard, heavy cream, portobello, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 748}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large portobello mushrooms, stems and gills removed with a spoon", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed", "3 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped", "Kosher salt", "1 shallot, finely chopped", "1/4 cup Cognac or another brandy", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brush the mushrooms all over with olive oil.
