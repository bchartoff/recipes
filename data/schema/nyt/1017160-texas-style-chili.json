{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Texas-Style Chili", "description": "Calling a dish \"Texas Chili,\u201d especially if you\u2019re not a native of that state, is clearly asking for trouble. But this recipe, refined over years of potlucks and Super Bowl parties, is too good to keep under wraps. Its depth of flavor, from different chile types, makes this recipe stand out. It also has whole spices, unsweetened chocolate and dark beer that meld seamlessly into a brick-red sauce that naps the succulent meat. The meat can be cut into large chunks, or, more traditionally, thin slices, especially if you are using a tougher cut than chuck. Sirloin also makes good chili. If you have masa harina, the corn flour used to make tortillas, that will make the gravy even thicker, but it is not necessary. Like many vigorously spiced dishes, this one tastes even better a day or two after it is made and will hold its flavor well for at least a week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/11/dining/31CHILI1/31CHILI1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef chuck, beer, red chile, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1869}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 286, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "341 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds", "1 1/2 teaspoons whole coriander seeds", "4 pounds beef chuck roast or steak", "1 teaspoon salt, more to taste", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus extra as needed", "1 large yellow or white onion, chopped, plus extra chopped onion for serving", "6 large garlic cloves, minced", "4 to 7 large fresh green jalape\u00f1os (depending on how much heat you like), stemmed, seeded and chopped", "3 tablespoons masa harina or 1 corn tortilla, torn into pieces (optional)", "2 tablespoons ground pure chile powder, such as pasilla, Chimayo or ancho", "1 tablespoon dried oregano", "1 (12-ounce) bottle Negra Modelo beer", "1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, or 3 10-ounce cans Ro-Tel canned tomatoes with green chiles", "1 ounce unsweetened chocolate", "3 whole dried large red chiles, such as New Mexico or guajillo", "Chopped fresh cilantro, for serving", "Fritos or warmed flour tortillas, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small heavy skillet, toast cumin and coriander seeds until fragrant.
