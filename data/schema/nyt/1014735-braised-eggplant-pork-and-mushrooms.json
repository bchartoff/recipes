{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Eggplant, Pork and Mushrooms", "description": "The honest, straightforward cuisine of the Hakkas, a nomadic people dispersed all over China, may be thought of as a country cousin of Cantonese. Dishes from the Hakka diaspora may not have the distinction or impact of those from Sichuan, but because they\u2019re interpreted broadly (note the addition of ketchup in many versions of pork and pineapple in the United States), they\u2019re fun, and they\u2019re easy to cook. This simple recipe for braised eggplant with pork and mushrooms, adapted from \"The Hakka Cookbook: Chinese Soul Food From Around the World\" by the food writer Linda Lau Anusasananan, is one such dish. Be sure to use small Asian or globe eggplants as they're more likely to keep their color and shape, and if you like more sauce, double it up.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/27/dining/27COOKING-EGGPLANTPORKMUSHROOM2/27COOKING-EGGPLANTPORKMUSHROOM2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 main-dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday", "keywords": "eggplant, ground pork, mushroom, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 387}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 359, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "631 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces Asian eggplant or globe eggplant", "3 tablespoons Chinese rice wine (Shaoxing) or dry sherry", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 tablespoon black vinegar orbalsamic vinegar", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "6 to 8 ounces ground pork", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "2 dried small hot red chilies, sliced", "3 ounces enoki mushrooms, trimmedof ends, rinsed and separated", "1/3 cup chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim off the stem ends from the\neggplant.
