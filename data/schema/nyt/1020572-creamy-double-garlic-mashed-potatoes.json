{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Double-Garlic Mashed Potatoes", "description": "Roasted garlic is the secret to these deeply flavored mashed potatoes with a lively crunch from garlic chips. This dish takes a little more planning and prep than your average mashed potatoes, but it is well worth the effort. You can roast and fry the garlic and peel the potatoes ahead of time, storing the prepared potatoes submerged in water in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours before cooking. Feel free to use either red or russet potatoes here: Red potatoes will make a thick and creamy mash, while russets will yield a lighter and fluffier result (see Tip). If you run short on time, trim the garlic chips from your to-do list. Canned fried onions from your local supermarket, or fried shallots or fried garlic flakes from most Asian markets provide the same jolt of texture on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/dining/aw-double-garlic-mashed-potatoes/merlin_163202121_9bfca02b-dd1f-4610-91f8-d585c19b8803-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings (8 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "bay leaves, butter, garlic, heavy cream, potato, rosemary, thyme, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 193}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 heads garlic", "6 teaspoons olive oil", "1 cup neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable oil", "6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced crosswise", "Kosher salt", "4 pounds red or russet potatoes (see Tip)", "2 cups heavy cream", "2 fresh bay leaves, or 4 dried bay leaves", "1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary, plus more for garnish", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, plus more for garnish", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), cut into small cubes, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high.
