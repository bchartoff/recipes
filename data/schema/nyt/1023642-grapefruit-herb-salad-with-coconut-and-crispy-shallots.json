{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grapefruit-Herb Salad With Coconut and Crispy Shallots", "description": "This grapefruit and herb salad puts citrus front and center. It\u2019s based on yum som-o, a pomelo salad from Thailand, where the fruit is abundant. Grapefruits are used here, but if you happen on pomelos, grab a few: They are much easier to peel and loosen from the protective piths. Fragrant toasted coconut, salty peanuts and crunchy shallots all create layers of texture. The dried shrimp adds a saltiness that greets your tongue in little bursts, and the fresh chile a lingering spice. This is a refreshing, vibrant side to accompany any rich meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/09komolaferex2-grapefruit/09komolaferex2-grapefruit-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "basil, chile, cilantro, grapefruit, peanut, salad, unsweetened coconut, thanksgiving, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 126}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup large unsweetened coconut flakes", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1/2 cup raw, skin-on whole peanuts", "Salt", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 limes)", "3 tablespoons fish sauce", "1 to 2 bird\u2019s-eye chiles, minced, or 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 garlic clove, minced", "4 red grapefruit", "1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1/4 cup Thai or sweet basil leaves, torn", "2 tablespoons tiny dried shrimp (optional)", "1/4 cup store-bought crispy shallots"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, toast the coconut flakes, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 3 minutes.

Over a large bowl, use your fingers to pull the citrus flesh off the membrane in large pieces. You can also use your knife to slice the flesh off the membrane. Discard the membrane and transfer the flesh to a large bowl.
