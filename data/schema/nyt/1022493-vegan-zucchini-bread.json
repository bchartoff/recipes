{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Zucchini Bread", "description": "This dairy- and egg-free spin on a cozy classic loaf cake comes together quickly in one bowl without much effort. Be sure to give the grated zucchini a good squeeze to release any excess liquid before you add it into the batter to avoid an overly dense, soggy cake. For a slightly more wholesome loaf, feel free to substitute 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour for 1/2 cup all-purpose flour. You can also add a handful of chopped chocolate or nuts, or both. Don\u2019t skip the sugar on top; it gives the finished loaf a wonderful crunchy crust. A note on sugar: Some sugar is processed using animal products and is not considered vegan. If you want to use vegan sugar, look for a brand that is U.S.D.A-certified organic, which ensures animal products are not used.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/27/dining/YA-Vegan-zucchini-bread/YA-Vegan-zucchini-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "One 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, quick breads, dessert", "keywords": "make-ahead, oat milk, one bowl, turbinado sugar, zucchini, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 371}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 cup/200 grams organic light brown sugar", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters unsweetened oat milk, soy milk or other nondairy milk", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters vegetable or other neutral oil", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 cups/225 grams coarsely grated zucchini (from 2 medium zucchini), squeezed in a towel to remove excess moisture", "2 cups/260 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 tablespoon turbinado sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees.
