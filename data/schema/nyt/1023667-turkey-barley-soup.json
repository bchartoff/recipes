{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Barley Soup", "description": "This mellow, velvety soup filled with barley and vegetables is a perfect place for your leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Adapted from Cristiana N. de Carvalho of Massachusetts, it\u2019s savory, herby and very warming on a cold winter evening. If you want to make your own stock from the turkey bones, the soup will be even richer. But store-bought stock works just as well and makes this straightforward recipe quick to put together. Brown rice makes an excellent barley substitute, though you may have to add a few minutes to the cooking time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/23/dining/22apperex1-barley/merlin_216459762_9dc645f3-39ca-480b-94ed-c161dda68c2b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "pearl barley, soup, thanksgiving leftover, turkey, thanksgiving, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1067}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil", "2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch coins", "2 celery stalks, thinly sliced", "1 medium yellow onion, finely diced", "3 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated", "2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage leaves", "2 teaspoons fine salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "Pinch of cayenne", "4 thyme sprigs", "4 parsley sprigs, plus 1 cup coarsely chopped parsley leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish", "1 bay leaf", "2 quarts turkey or chicken stock, preferably homemade", "3/4 cup pearled barley", "2 to 3 cups shredded or chopped leftover turkey", "1 lemon, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large soup pot over medium-high, melt butter, or heat the oil until shimmering.
