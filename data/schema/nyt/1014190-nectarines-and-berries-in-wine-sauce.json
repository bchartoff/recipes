{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nectarines and Berries in Wine Sauce", "description": "I have kept a box of white wine in my refrigerator and red in the pantry almost since these easily dispensed wines first became available. Need a half-cup, a cup or more for a recipe? It\u2019s at hand, ready to go into the pot, and there\u2019s also some always ready to go into the cook.About the only time I serve the wines is on an informal occasion, for example if someone wants a glass of white when everybody else is drinking red. The wines are also handy for a mixed wine drink like a kir, or even sangria.Their destiny, as the poaching liquid for summer nectarines, could not be more rewarding. The fruit is mixed with berries, and the wine, sweetened with sugar, is enriched with berry pur\u00e9e and reduced to a sauce. Whether to use white or red depends on the berries you select. Do not skimp on the chilling time; overnight would not be a mistake. It improves the dessert.
