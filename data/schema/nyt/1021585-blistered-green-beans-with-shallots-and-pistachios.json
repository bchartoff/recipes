{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blistered Green Beans With Shallots and Pistachios", "description": "The bittersweet taste of blistered green beans shines through the strong flavors of soy and lime in this side dish, where fried shallots, garlic and pistachios add crunch. Cutting the beans in half makes them easier to maneuver in the wok and helps them cook evenly. For a bit of heat, toss in a minced bird\u2019s-eye chile or sprinkle some red-pepper flakes over the dish when adding your garnishes. You can serve these blistered beauties alongside your Thanksgiving turkey \u2014 but they\u2019re equally at home on the dinner table, regardless of the season.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/27/dining/ns-green-beans/ns-green-beans-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "garlic, green beans, lime, pistachio, shallot, soy sauce, thanksgiving, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 781}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed, plus more as needed", "3 medium shallots or 1 small red onion, peeled and sliced crosswise into rings", "Fine sea salt", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "2 tablespoons chopped pistachios", "1 1/2 pounds green beans, trimmed and cut in half", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "2 tablespoons lime juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large wok or saucepan set over high, adding more as needed to cover the bottom.
