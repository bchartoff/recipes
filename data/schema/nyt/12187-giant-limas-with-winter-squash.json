{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Giant Limas With Winter Squash", "description": "I love the fact that beans, lentils and greens symbolize prosperity in the New Year in places as disparate as the American South and the South of France. I wonder if it\u2019s really because lentils and beans are round like coins and swell when they cook, or if it\u2019s because that\u2019s about all anybody can afford to eat after the excesses of the holiday season. <br/><br/>The notion of thrift wouldn\u2019t apply to some of the other foods that symbolize good luck or prosperity in certain cultures \u2013 fish, for instance, or saffron. I\u2019ve taken traditions from different places this week and thrown some of them together, focusing mainly on lentils, beans, greens and fish. These are simple dishes that I hope will help you to begin 2012 on a happy, healthy note. Look for more New Year\u2019s dishes  in the Recipes for Health index. <br/><br/>Baking in a slow oven is the best way to cook large lima beans, which can fall apart easily if boiled too hard. This dish is luxuriously creamy (though there\u2019s no cream in it) and comforting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/27/science/26recipehealth/26recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "fall, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, lima beans, winter squash, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 344, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "17 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1245 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 pound (about 2 1/2 cups) dried giant lima beans, rinsed", "2 quarts plus 1 cup water", "A bouquet garni made with a bay leaf, a Parmesan rind and a sprig each of sage, thyme and parsley", "1 pound winter squash, peeled and cut in small dice", "Salt to taste", "Freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons slivered fresh sage leaves", "Freshly grated Parmesan for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
