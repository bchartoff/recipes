{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Make-Ahead Fried Chicken", "description": "Fried chicken is one of the few fried foods that tastes just as good served at room temperature as it does when it's served hot enough to burn your fingers. This recipe has been specially engineered to be made in advance. It\u2019s seasoned assertively, so the flavors won\u2019t dull as it cools. But the real key is double-dipping the chicken in the flour mixture before you fry it, making for an extra-crunchy crust that holds up all afternoon. And it lets you serve fried chicken to your guests and still have enough time to clean the kitchen and take a shower before they arrive.\n\nAlthough the recipe calls for all drumsticks, which won\u2019t dry out as they sit, feel free to substitute other chicken parts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/02/multimedia/clark-fried-chicken/clark-fried-chicken-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "buttermilk, chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 324}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 852, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1131 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 quart buttermilk\u00a0", "2 torn bay leaves", "2 thinly sliced shallots", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons Tabasco sauce", "1 tablespoon Old Bay Seasoning", "1 teaspoon dry mustard powder", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons cracked black pepper", "1 tablespoon honey\u00a0", "12 drumsticks, about 2\u00bd to 3 pounds chicken \u00a0", "4 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon cayenne\u00a0", "2 teaspoons kosher salt\u00a0", "1 teaspoon good chile power such as chipotle powder\u00a0", "Corn, grapeseed or vegetable oil, for frying\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the marinade: Whisk together all the marinade ingredients, except the chicken, and place in a large bowl or plastic bag.
