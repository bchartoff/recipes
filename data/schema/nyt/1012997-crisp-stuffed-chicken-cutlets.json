{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crisp Stuffed Chicken Cutlets", "description": "The chef Alexandra Raij modeled this recipe on a traditional Spanish dish called flamenquines, in which flattened chicken breasts are stuffed with ham and cheese, then rolled up, coated in egg and bread crumbs and fried. Her recipe mostly follows that lead, but instead of pounding the breasts and rolling them up with the stuffing, she used thin cutlets of chicken and layered the stuffing between two of them, sealing them together with an egg mixture. Fried to a golden hue, the dish is both crunchy and greaseless. The crumbs insulate the delicate meat and help keep it from overcooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/Crispy-Stuffed-Chicken-Cutlets-With-Ham-Cheese-and-Sauerkraut/Crispy-Stuffed-Chicken-Cutlets-With-Ham-Cheese-and-Sauerkraut-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "chicken, ham, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 253}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1080, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "91 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "1208 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 boneless, skinless chicken cutlets (about 1 1/4 pounds total)", "Kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 large egg whites", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley", "2 teaspoons minced garlic", "Dijon mustard", "1 1/2 ounces thinly sliced provolone cheese (1 1/2 slices)", "1 1/2 ounces thinly sliced ham (1 1/2 slices)", "3 tablespoons sauerkraut, packed, more for serving", "3/8 teaspoon caraway seeds", "2 cups plain bread crumbs", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken lightly with salt and pepper.
