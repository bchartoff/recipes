{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "San Antonio Margarita", "description": "Josie Davidson is one of the great hostesses of South Texas and learned to make margaritas from her father, Chris Gill, who received the recipe in the 1970s from Mario Cantu, owner of Mario's, an old-line Mexican restaurant in San Antonio. She passed her knowledge along to The Times in 2015: Combine equal parts tequila, orange liqueur and fresh lime juice in a pitcher, using a measuring glass if you have one to get it to 26 ounces exactly (deploy a splash or so more than a cup per liquid if you don\u2019t), then add 6 ounces of water to the mix and set it in the refrigerator to chill. Serve over ice in glasses with salted rims. She doesn\u2019t use triple sec \u2014 she says it\u2019s too cloying. Her father advocates Cointreau. For Davidson, only Paula\u2019s Texas Orange liqueur will do.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/06/magazine/san-antonio-margarita/san-antonio-margarita-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 795}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 367, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "7 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup plus a splash tequila", "1 cup plus a splash orange liqueur", "1 cup plus a splash freshly squeezed lime juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine liquids in a pitcher with 6 ounces water and stir to combine.
