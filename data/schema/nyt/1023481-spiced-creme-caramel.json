{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Cr\u00e8me Caramel", "description": "This silky, gently set custard with the right amount of warmth from toasted spices and sharpness from caramelized sugar is a perfect way to welcome the cooling weather of fall. In this recipe, a fragrant combination of cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, ginger and nutmeg known as sweet hawaij adds an autumnal aroma. Sweet hawaij, which is found in cooking across North Africa and the Middle East, is commonly added to hot coffee, and is also used in desserts and sweets. Trusting your senses will give you the best results here: Notice the aroma of the spices as they gently toast; watch the sugar deepen to a golden amber as it caramelizes; and see how the custard slowly jiggles in its water bath once it is set. Pay attention! The reward is a treat to end a meal or a perfect bite to enjoy with a cup of black coffee.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/28/dining/22komolaferex-creme/merlin_212662662_12893fee-d24c-4a34-b742-fefad556a1bc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "cardamom, egg yolks, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, heavy cream, milk, plan-ahead, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 95}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons ground sweet hawaij (see Tip)", "1 1/2 cups/350 milliliters heavy cream", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "10 egg yolks, room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "2 1/2 cups/625 milliliters whole milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a small saucepan over medium heat.

Heat a separate small saucepan over medium until a drop of water sizzles on the surface. Reduce heat to medium-low. Make a dry caramel by adding 3/4 cup/150 grams sugar to the pan in an even layer. The sugar will gradually begin melting into a syrup. If it browns immediately, your pan is too hot and the heat should be turned down to low. Allow the sugar to melt, stirring in any dry spots with a heat-safe spatula, about 2 minutes. As the crystals melt, the syrup will change color from light to golden brown, about another 4 minutes. Once the sugar has melted, continue to stir and cook the syrup until it\u2019s a light amber color and smoke begins to rise from the surface of the caramel, 2 minutes more. Immediately pour the caramel into the bottom of the cake pan and swirl the pan to evenly coat it with caramel.
