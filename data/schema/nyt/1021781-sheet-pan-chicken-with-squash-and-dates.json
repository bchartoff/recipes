{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Squash and Dates", "description": "This weeknight sheet-pan dinner combines chicken with simple ingredients that hit a number of notes, all salty, sweet, tangy and rich. The juicy Medjool dates caramelize as they cook, while the chickpeas become extra toasty and nutty. Their textures complement the velvety roasted squash and meaty chicken. A lemony olive-caper relish with fresh parsley, bolstered by pan juices, brightens and balances. Chop up leftovers and repurpose them in a rice salad with crumbled feta or grated Parmesan for extra tang. Or, for a fantastic vegetarian side dish or warm salad, you could make this recipe without the chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/24/dining/kc-sheet-pan-chicken-with-delicata-squash/kc-sheet-pan-chicken-with-delicata-squash-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, roasts, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "chicken, chicken legs, chickpea, dates, delicata squash, olives", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1020}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds delicata squash (about 2 large squash), scrubbed, halved lengthwise, seeded and sliced crosswise into 1-inch-thick pieces", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 whole bone-in, skin-on chicken legs (about 3 pounds)", "4 ounces pitted large Medjool dates (about 6), quartered lengthwise", "1/2 cup pitted green olives (about 2 ounces), coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley", "1 tablespoon drained capers, plus 2 tablespoons caper brine", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
