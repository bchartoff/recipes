I called it spaghetti sauce, and it was a simple tomato sauce with ground beef. It didn\u2019t taste that much different from this sauce, which has only a quarter pound of meat in it \u2013 but that is all it needs to have a rich flavor and a meaty texture. The mushroom base is a perfect stand-in for half the meat; you could double the amount for a vegetarian sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/04/science/recipehealthmeatsauce/recipehealthmeatsauce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "3 cups, or enough for 9 pasta servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sauces and gravies, vegetables", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, nut-free, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 129}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 113, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "590 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 yellow or red onion, finely chopped", "2 plump garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 pound ground beef or veal", "Pinch of ground cinnamon", "Salt  to taste", "freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1/4 pound (about 2/3 cups) <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017259-roasted-mushroom-base\">roasted mushroom mix</a>", "1 28-ounce can plus 1 14.5-ounce can chopped tomatoes in juice, pulsed in a food processor", "1/4 teaspoon sugar", "1 teaspoon oregano", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, deep skillet or casserole heat olive oil over medium heat and add onion.
