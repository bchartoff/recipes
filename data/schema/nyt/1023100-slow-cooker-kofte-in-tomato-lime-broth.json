They are made in the style of kofte (from the Persian word meaning \u201cgrind\u201d), in which ground meat is combined with lots of herbs and ground spices. Yogurt adds moisture and tang, but you don\u2019t need another binder or to brown the meat first. As the meatballs slowly cook, their juices mingle with the tomatoes to create a rich but tart broth. Eat with grains (bulgur wheat, farro, rice), couscous, noodles or pita.
