{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hearty Quinoa and White Bean Soup", "description": "Soup doesn't have to be loaded with meat to be deeply satisfying. This one from Mary McCartney, devoted vegetarian, cookbook author and a daughter of Paul, is proof of that fact. Quinoa adds a lovely bit of texture, and beans \u2013 practically any variety will do \u2013 add heft and a wonderful creaminess as they break down in the broth. This recipe begs to be tampered with, so feel free to add more beans, vegetables, quinoa or fresh herbs. One reader even added a few cups of cooked pasta. It's almost impossible to mess up, so don't hold back.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/dining/25COOKING-HeareBeanSoup1/25COOKING-HeareBeanSoup1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings (about 2 1/2 quarts)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "main course, quinoa, vegetables, white beans, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1104}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 240, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1155 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup light olive oil", "2 medium onions, finely chopped", "2 medium carrots, peeled and finely chopped", "2 stalks celery, trimmed and finely diced", "1 can (14 1/2 ounces) cannellini or other white beans, drained", "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 can (14 1/2 ounces) chopped tomatoes, with their juices", "7 cups vegetable stock", "1/3 cup quinoa", "1/4 cup chopped parsley", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano, rosemary or thyme", "1 bay leaf", "Sea salt and ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.
