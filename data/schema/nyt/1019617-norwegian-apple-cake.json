{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Norwegian Apple Cake", "description": "Though quite straightforward, this recipe for Norwegian apple cake from Nevada Berg's cookbook \u201cNorth Wild Kitchen\u201d did raise a question. A whole tablespoon of cinnamon? Really? But it was not at all excessive, giving the cake autumnal fragrance and flavor along with a nicely burnished surface. What this recipe also offers is great flexibility. Though it calls for an 8-inch springform, it also worked in a 9-inch and a 10-inch, the latter providing a little less cake in proportion to topping (though no change in cooking time). Larger pans require more fruit. And on that score, in place of apples the recipe works well with fresh figs and peaches. Small purple plums, pears, apricots and even bananas are some other options to consider.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/dining/berg-apple-cake-horizontal/berg-apple-cake-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "apple, sliced almonds, whipping cream, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 373}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 449, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "229 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tart apples, like Granny Smith", "1 cup/227 grams (2 sticks) salted butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/4 ounces whole milk", "1/3 cup/32 grams sliced almonds", "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon cinnamon", "Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel and core apples; slice 1/2-inch thick.
