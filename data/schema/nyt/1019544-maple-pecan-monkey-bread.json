{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple Pecan Monkey Bread", "description": "Maple syrup gives an autumnal feel and subtler sweetness to traditionally sugary monkey bread. Any grade of maple syrup works: B and C will give you a more robust maple flavor, while Grade A will deliver a more delicate, refined sweetness. Here, the syrup is mixed with brown butter and used to glaze extra-rich brioche dough rounds and toasted pecans. It all caramelizes together into a fluffy yet chewy pull-apart bread punctuated with the crunch of nuts. If you prefer a rustic look, you don\u2019t have to roll the pieces of dough into balls. Just cut them into even pieces and coat with the cinnamon sugar. This recipe is at its soft and gooey best the day it\u2019s made, but it can be kept at room temperature overnight and reheated in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/04/dining/maple-pecan-monkey-bread/maple-pecan-monkey-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, breads, pastries", "keywords": "dessert, side dish, fall, winter, maple syrup, pecan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 186}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 450, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "251 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 cups/450 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon instant yeast", "2 1/2 teaspoons fine salt", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters plus 2 tablespoons maple syrup", "1 1/4 cups/285 grams unsalted butter (2 1/2 sticks), cut up and softened, plus more for the bowl and pan", "1/4 cup/50 grams sugar", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 cup/100 grams pecan halves, toasted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix flour, yeast and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt on low speed to blend.
