{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey and Hominy Chili With Smoky Chipotle", "description": "Making an authentic pozole \u2014 the fragrant Mexican hominy stew \u2014 has been on my list of things to do for years, but it can be very labor intensive. One recipe by Diana Kennedy, the author of Mexican cookbooks, calls for trimming hominy and boiling a pig\u2019s head. Just reading about it causes my enthusiasm to wane. This stew is a compromise; a sort of a pozole-chili hybrid, loaded with ground turkey, bell peppers, hominy and pinto beans. Chile powder adds heat, jalape\u00f1o brightness and canned chipotle chile in adobo smokiness and depth. A bottle of beer provides a pleasant bitterness that complements the spice. This recipe makes a very large batch perfect for entertaining or for stocking the freezer, but you can easily half it to feed a family of four.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/01/dining/turkey-hominy-chili-chipotle/turkey-hominy-chili-chipotle-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "ground turkey, white hominy, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 479}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 444, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1116 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons olive oil", "2 1/2 pounds ground turkey", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "6 garlic cloves, chopped", "2 tablespoons chili powder", "2 large Spanish onions, chopped", "1 red pepper, chopped", "1 green pepper, chopped", "1 to 2 jalape\u00f1o peppers, to taste, seeded and chopped", "1 28-ounce can tomato pur\u00e9e", "2 15-ounce cans white hominy, drained", "2 15-ounce cans pinto beans, drained", "1 12-ounce bottle beer", "2 to 3 chipotles in adobo sauce, to taste, minced", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "2 bay leaves", "Sour cream, for serving", "5 scallions, white and light green parts, sliced, for serving", "1 bunch chopped cilantro, for serving", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon oil.
