{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Eggs on Toast", "description": "You don\u2019t even need a toaster to make perfect toast. Crisping bread in a skillet \u2014 in melted butter, of course \u2014 gives it a tasty brown crunch and leaves you with a hot pan ready to scramble eggs. Be sure to swipe up all the butter and crumbs with the toasted bread when you take it out to keep the eggs nice and golden. Because more butter is added to the pan at the same time as the eggs, it melts slowly into the eggs while you stir them, leaving you with a creamy mix that ends up even creamier when cheese is melted in at the very end.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/22/dining/21beginnerrex8/merlin_208160643_302a75cd-0de6-467a-adeb-b4f209561919-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy", "keywords": "cheese, eggs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large eggs", "Salt and pepper", "1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 slice bread", "1/4 cup shredded cheese (Cheddar, Monterey Jack or a blend)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Crack the eggs into a bowl and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
