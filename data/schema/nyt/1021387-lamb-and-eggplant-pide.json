{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb and Eggplant Pide", "description": "Sometimes referred to as Turkish pizza, pide (pronounced pea-DAY) is made with a simple yeast dough. You can make your own dough, or use two 8-ounce balls of store-bought pizza dough, if you like. Spiced ground lamb is a typical Turkish topping, but we use some diced eggplant and a bit of yogurt and mint as a nod to moussaka. Adding an egg to the yogurt thickens it, so when it\u2019s cooked it becomes an almost-cheesy layer between the meat and dough. If you can\u2019t find ground lamb, you can substitute ground beef, and for a vegetarian version, omit the meat and double up on the eggplant.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jessica Battilana"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/20/dining/jb-pide/merlin_175805178_4e3493fc-4297-4ce5-82b0-4d57a2f9056b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "12 pide or 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "turkish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, breads, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "eggplant, flour, lamb, sugar, yeast, yogurt, fall, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 126}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/180 milliliters warm water", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "2 1/4 cups/290 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 small onion, diced", "1 small eggplant (8 ounces/225 grams), diced", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/8 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 pound/225 grams ground lamb", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 cup/15 grams fresh mint, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon olive oil, for brushing the pans and the pides", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters plain full-fat yogurt", "1 large egg", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In the bowl of stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or in a large bowl with a wooden spoon) combine the water and sugar.
