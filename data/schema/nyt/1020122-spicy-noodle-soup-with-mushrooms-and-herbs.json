With the addition of soy sauce, the broth takes on an almost beefy flavor; the vinegar helps to perk it right back up for a nearly hot and sour flavor profile. For the best (and most interesting) results, try to seek out a mix of mushrooms for a variety of flavors and textures.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/dining/29romanrex/merlin_147497208_84b04ae4-b838-44be-97fb-3e51909c5713-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, noodles, soups and stews", "keywords": "main course, mushroom, soy sauce, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2116}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 436, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "70 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1159 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons canola or olive oil", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 large shallots, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms, such as maitake, oyster, cremini or shiitake, torn into bite-size pieces", "1 to 2 fresh red or green chiles, such as Fresno, thinly sliced (or 3/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes)", "1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce, plus more to taste", "1/4 cup unseasoned rice wine vinegar, plus more to taste", "8 to 10 ounces noodles, such as udon, soba, rice or spaghetti", "2 cups herbs (tender leaves and stems), such as cilantro, mint, chives, parsley or a mix, for serving", "Sesame seeds, sesame oil or both, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
