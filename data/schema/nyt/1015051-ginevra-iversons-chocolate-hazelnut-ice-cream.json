{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ginevra Iverson\u2019s Chocolate Hazelnut Ice Cream", "description": "This recipe came to The Times from Ginevra Iverson, a chef and former owner of Calliope in New York. To make this luscious ice cream, she melts a few tablespoons of butter along with the gianduja (hazelnut-imbued chocolate) before whisking it into the custard. The only potentially tricky part is combining those two mixtures; the custard and melted gianduja need to be the same temperature, otherwise you could break the two emulsions and the whole thing will contract and curdle. Feel free to substitute plain old Nutella for the gianduja, and when folding the roasted hazelnuts in, mind the nut dust you sometimes get from peeling them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/21/dining/dj-take/dj-take-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 pints", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dessert, gianduja, hazelnut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 37}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup hazelnuts", "6 ounces gianduja (chocolate-hazelnut) paste (about 3/4 cup)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup half-and-half", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "Pinch salt", "1 vanilla bean, split and scraped", "6 egg yolks", "2 cups heavy cream", "Melted bittersweet chocolate, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and spread hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet.
