Well, what do biscuits mean to the South, or green chiles to the people of New Mexico? Mofongo, which in its most traditional form is a fried-and-mashed fusion of plantains, pork rinds, garlic and peppers, symbolizes the island\u2019s soul food. It is beloved, even if sometimes misunderstood; it can be vexingly heavy, but when it\u2019s executed properly there\u2019s a righteous balance of crispness and fluff. \nFor this recipe we went to Jose Enrique, the Puerto Rican chef who\u2019s gaining attention for giving Caribbean cuisine an extra layer of refinement. We asked him for a mofongo for the Thanksgiving table, standing at the ready to soak up gravy and meet your turkey on the tip of a fork.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19PUERTORICO/19PUERTORICO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "garlic, plantain, tomatoes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 566, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "13 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "4 garlic cloves, chopped", "1/4 cup chopped cubanelle peppers (about 1/2 pepper)", "1/4 cup chopped aj\u00ed dulce peppers (about 3 small peppers)", "1 aj\u00ed caballero pepper (or use 1 fresno chile)", "12 ounces tomatoes, chopped (about 2 tomatoes)", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "2 tablespoons butter", "Vegetable oil, for frying", "4 green plantains, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 pounds)", "1 ounce pork rinds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
