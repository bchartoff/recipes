{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Shrimp With Chard, Chiles and Ginger", "description": "Spicy saut\u00e9ed chard with chiles and ginger is full of flavor, easy and pleasing with pretty much any protein. Here, it moves to the center of the plate with plump, seared shrimp. Any kind of chard can be used for this dish, but rainbow or red will be prettier than white-stemmed Swiss chard. That\u2019s because those stems go right into the pan along with the leaves. It\u2019s not only less wasteful, but the stems also add a pronounced, succulent texture to the mix. \n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/09/dining/09Dinner/09Dinner-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "chard, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 237}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1210 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds cleaned extra-large shrimp ", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more for seasoning the shrimp ", "2 bunches red or rainbow chard, rinsed (about 1 pound) ", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil ", "4 cloves garlic, minced ", "1 hot chile like Thai or Hungarian wax, seeded if desired and thinly sliced ", "1 long mild or sweet chile like Italian frying, thinly sliced ", "1 shallot, chopped ", "1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root ", "2 teaspoons light brown sugar ", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ", "1 to 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, to taste ", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season shrimp generously with salt.
