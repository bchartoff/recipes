{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tahini-Glazed Carrots", "description": "A little sweet from date syrup, creamy from tahini and very tangy from plenty of lemon juice, this roasted carrot dish \u2014 adapted from Adeena Sussman\u2019s cookbook \u201cSababa\u201d \u2014 has charisma to spare. It\u2019s also extremely easy to make. While the carrots roast with olive oil and cumin, all you do is whisk together a simple glaze from pantry ingredients. If you don\u2019t have the date syrup on hand, maple syrup works just as well, making the dish slightly sweeter but no less compelling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/dining/mc-tahini-carrots/mc-tahini-carrots-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, vegetables", "keywords": "carrot, cumin, lemon, tahini, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 198}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds slender carrots (or thick carrots, halved lengthwise), peeled", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup tahini", "3 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, to taste", "3 tablespoons silan (date syrup), or maple syrup", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
