{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Best Clam Chowder", "description": "This is a basic New England clam chowder, though with leeks used in place of the traditional onions, and a splash of wine to add a floral note. Also: thyme. Very continental! It is shockingly delicious and deserves its title as best. Bacon will add a smoky note to the stew. If you use it, it may be worth it to go the whole distance and get expensive double-smoked bacon instead of the standard supermarket fare. The salt pork, which is not smoked, will take the meal in the opposite direction, emphasizing the pure flavor of the clams.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/03/dining/COOKING-BEST-CLAM-CHOWDER2/COOKING-BEST-CLAM-CHOWDER2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1307}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 398, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "544 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["24 medium-size quahog clams, usually rated \u2018\u2018top neck\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018cherrystone,\u2019\u2019 rinsed", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1/4 pound slab bacon or salt pork, diced", "2 leeks, tops removed, halved and cleaned, then sliced into half moons", "3 large Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "3 sprigs thyme", "1 bay leaf", "2 cups cream", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1/4 cup chopped parsley."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the clams in a large, heavy Dutch oven, add about 4 cups water, then set over medium-high heat.
