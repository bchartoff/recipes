{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Fennel and Farro Salad", "description": "This salty-sweet grain salad is filled with bits of caramelized roasted fennel, sweet dates and briny olives, and is bolstered by orange, red-pepper flakes and herbs. It\u2019s substantial enough to be a light meatless dinner on its own, or it can be served as a hearty side with simply roasted or saut\u00e9ed chicken or fish. It holds up well, and any leftovers will be a boon to future lunches. The feta topping is optional and adds a creamy tanginess, but the mix of roasted vegetables, dried fruit and grains is just as good without it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/28/multimedia/18apperex1-fennel-qltc/18apperex1-fennel-qltc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "dates, farro, fennel, feta, fresh herb, grain bowl, green olives, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 fennel bulbs (about 1 1/4 pounds without fronds), halved lengthwise, cored and sliced \u00bd-inch thick (about 3 cups)", "4 thyme sprigs", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 cup pearled or semi-pearled farro", "1 bay leaf", "1 orange", "3 tablespoons red-wine vinegar, plus more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed", "1 cup mixed herbs, such as parsley, dill, cilantro and mint", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped pitted green olives", "1/4 cup thinly sliced pitted dates", "3 scallions, thinly sliced", "1/3 cup crumbled feta (optional)", "1/2 cup toasted sliced almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
