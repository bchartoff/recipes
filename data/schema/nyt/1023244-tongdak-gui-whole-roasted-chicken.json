{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tongdak Gui (Whole Roasted Chicken)", "description": "This recipe draws inspiration from the old-fashioned rotisserie chickens sold along Seoul\u2019s streets in the 1970s \u2014 before Korean fried chicken entered the scene in the next decade. Cornish game hens are an excellent substitute for the smaller, younger birds often used in South Korea for this succulent poultry dish. A simple soy-sauce brine, made even more fragrant with ground white pepper, ensures inimitably juicy, tender meat that, after roasting in the oven for an hour, truly falls off the bone. A nod to pa dak (\u201cscallion chicken\u201d), an early-2000s trend in which shaved scallions were served atop fried chicken to cut the fattiness, this recipe calls for lightly dressed scallions for a verdant counterpoint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/15ESSENTIALSrex8/merlin_207587424_1730c41c-1a37-47f8-b174-41ae93baae5c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "cornish game hens, scallion, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup coarse kosher salt or 1/2 cup kosher salt, such as Diamond Crystal, plus more for the scallions", "1/4 cup granulated sugar, plus more for the scallions", "1 teaspoon ground white pepper", "2 Cornish game hens (about 3 \u00bd pounds total)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "4 scallions, cut into 4-inch segments, then very thinly sliced lengthwise", "1 tablespoon rice vinegar", "Steamed white rice, for serving", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022369-yangnyeom-sauce\">Yangnyeom sauce</a>, for dipping (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a gallon-size resealable plastic bag in a large bowl.
