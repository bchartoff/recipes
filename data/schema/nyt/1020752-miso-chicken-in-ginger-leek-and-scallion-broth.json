{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso Chicken in Ginger, Leek and Scallion Broth", "description": "This chicken dish gets most of its flavor from miso, the traditional Japanese paste made from fermented soybeans or other grains, and relies on boneless, skinless thighs, which are nearly impossible to overcook. First simmered in water (or chicken broth for depth), the thighs are then slathered with a seasoned miso mixture and roasted until the miso forms a beautiful glaze. Use light miso (yellow or white) for a mild, nutty flavor, or dark miso (red or brown) for a deeper rustic quality. Both kinds keep up to a year in the refrigerator.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/03/dining/03tanisrex2-chicken/merlin_166404972_c5cb4ffd-42c2-4542-90eb-3dc321da4019-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, ginger, gochugaru, leeks, miso, rice wine vinegar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 213}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)", "Salt and pepper", "2 large garlic cloves, smashed but not peeled, plus 1/2 teaspoon grated garlic", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeled and thickly sliced, plus 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger", "1 small onion, thinly sliced", "6 cups chicken broth (optional)", "1/4 cup mirin", "4 tablespoons yellow or red miso", "1/2 teaspoon gochugaru (Korean red-pepper flakes)", "2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 cups leeks, white and tender green parts, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put chicken thighs in a large pot, seasoning well with salt and pepper on both sides.
