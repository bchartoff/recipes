{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Joanne Chang\u2019s Maple-Blueberry Scones", "description": "These scones, created by Joanne Chang for her Flour Bakery & Cafe in Boston, are studded with fresh blueberries, sweetened with maple syrup and made with a blend of whole-wheat and all-purpose flours \u2014 but don\u2019t think of them as health food. They\u2019ve also got cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and plenty of butter. They\u2019re big. They\u2019re glazed. And they\u2019ve got a singular texture: tender, like a layer cake, but also flaky, like a traditional scone. It wasn\u2019t until I made them myself that I realized that their texture is different because the technique is different: Most scone recipes call for the butter to be rubbed into the flour mixture until it\u2019s coated with flour. In Ms. Chang\u2019s recipe, half the butter gets this treatment, which makes the scones characteristically flaky. The other half of the butter is beaten into the dry ingredients so that it becomes the coating for the flour, making the scones tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/05/magazine/05mag-eat/05mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 scones", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, dessert", "keywords": "blueberries, butter, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, maple syrup, scone, whole wheat flour, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2520}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 2/3 cups/240 grams whole-wheat flour", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), cold, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/2 cup/120 grams cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, Greek yogurt or sour cream, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters maple syrup", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature", "1 large egg yolk, at room temperature", "1 cup/125 grams fresh blueberries", "1/2 cup/60 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 to 3 tablespoons maple syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, briefly mix both flours, the baking powder, baking soda and salt on low speed.

Stop the mixer, and mix the rest of the loose flour into the dough by hand: Gather and lift the dough with your hands and turn it over in the bowl several times until all the loose flour is mixed in.
