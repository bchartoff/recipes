{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quick Jambalaya", "description": "This recipe makes quick work out of jambalaya by using leftover rice, and it tastes great with freshly cooked grains, too. To make this meal meatless, use vegan andouille sausage or stick with pork sausage, if you prefer. Either option, along with creole seasoning and the classic trinity of creole cooking \u2014 onion, celery and green bell pepper \u2014 result in a dish that is unmistakably Louisianan. Though many jambalaya recipes skip tomatoes, this version uses a blend of tomato paste and diced tomatoes to add bulk, and an acidity that helps lighten up the otherwise hearty one-pot meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/20/dining/VL-quick-jambalaya/merlin_200470107_1d85e661-c3b5-42c8-ba00-cedb8f07b161-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, celery, rice, sausage", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 751}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium yellow onion, diced", "2 links pork or vegan andouille or chorizo sausage (6 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 celery stalks, thinly sliced", "1 green bell pepper, diced", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 cups cooked long-grain white rice", "1 tablespoon creole seasoning", "Salt and black pepper", "1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes", "1 tablespoon hot sauce, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons sliced scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium.
