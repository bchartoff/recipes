But is it Italian?\u201d Florence Fabricant set out to find out in a 1996 column. She spoke to a number of experts on Italian food, but came away with few answers. Some insisted it was an Italian-American dish, with roots in New York, specifically Long Island or Little Italy, while others pointed to Naples. She included this recipe, adapted from \u201cLobster at Home\u201d by Jasper White, the executive chef of the Legal Sea Foods chain. His version is served on bread, but this adaptation is served on pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "linguine, lobster, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 10}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1009, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "99 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "93 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1960 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped fine", "1 tablespoon garlic chopped fine", "1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 cup fish or seafood stock", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 bay leaf", "1 28-ounce can Italian plum tomatoes", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste", "2 lobsters, each 1 3/4 pounds, cut up", "Salt", "1 pound linguine", "1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy 3-quart saucepan.
