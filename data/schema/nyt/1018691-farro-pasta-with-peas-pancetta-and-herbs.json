{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro Pasta With Peas, Pancetta and Herbs", "description": "This quickly made, exceedingly delicious recipe is a springtime celebration of peas: snow peas, sugar-snap peas and garden peas, all freshly shucked. (Of course, you can use only one kind, if you prefer.) A touch of pancetta adds a salty umami to the peas' sweetness. Good ham or thick-sliced bacon also work, and, for a vegetarian version, you can  use roughly chopped green olives. Here, the rustic, nutty flavor of whole-grain farro pasta provides a lovely contrast. Look for dried farro spaghetti or, if you can find them, fresh farro pappardelle or fettuccine. But if farro pasta is unavailable, whole-wheat or buckwheat noodles are also quite pea-friendly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05KITCHEN1/05KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "lemon zest, mint, pancetta, parsley, peas, sage, scallion, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 30}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 523, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "547 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 ounces pancetta, about 2 thick slices, cut crosswise into lardons", "1 pound farro spaghetti or another pasta shape", "1 1/2 cups chopped scallions, about 2 trimmed bunches", "1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped sage", "1 1/2 cups shucked garden peas, about 8 ounces", "1 1/2 cups snap peas, about 8 ounces, trimmed", "2 cups snow peas, about 6 ounces, trimmed", "2 tablespoons butter at room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped mint", "1/4 cup crumbled ricotta salata or mild feta cheese, about 2 ounces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large pot of well-salted water over high heat and bring to a boil for the pasta."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large, wide skillet over medium-high heat.
