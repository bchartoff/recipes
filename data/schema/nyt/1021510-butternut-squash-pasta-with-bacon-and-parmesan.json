{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butternut Squash Pasta With Bacon and Parmesan", "description": "In this cozy weeknight meal, roasted butternut squash and Parmesan are combined for a dish that\u2019s flavorful but not too heavy. A bit of thick-cut bacon adds crunch and smokiness. If you don\u2019t have thick-cut on hand, you can certainly use thin-cut, but keep an eye on it, as it will cook through faster. Be prepared to pluck it from the oven once crisp and allow the vegetables to finish cooking at their own pace. A handful of chopped fresh herbs added just before serving gives this comforting dish a bit of brightness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/dining/ya-butternut-squash-pasta/merlin_178752225_6c0547c3-c015-4cf6-8f4c-ae2b5f90646e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pastas, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "bacon, butternut squash, parmesan, pasta, red onion, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1554}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds butternut squash, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces (about 4 cups)", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 medium red onion, cut into 1-inch dice", "5 slices thick-cut bacon (about 5 ounces)", "12 ounces short, twisty pasta, like campanelle or cavatappi", "3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan (about 1 1/2 ounces)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 375 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the butternut squash to a large baking sheet.
