The beans will change from firm and bright to limp and gray. But right around the two-hour mark, they'll transform again, into a dark, tangled mess, soft but defined. They'll taste extraordinarily rich, deliriously sweet and dense with flavor. All it takes is time and courage. Use this technique with almost any vegetable. It works particularly well with the shunned, the fibrous and the forgotten-in-the-fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/magazine/27eat1/27eat1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4-6", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "basil, romano beans", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 249}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "8 cloves garlic, peeled", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 large shallot, thinly sliced", "3 anchovy fillets, optional", "2 pounds Romano beans, green beans, wax beans or filet beans", "2 tablespoons water", "20 large basil leaves, divided", "Kosher or fine sea salt", "1/2 of 1 lemon", "Ricotta salata, pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese, for serving, optional", "2 3/4 pounds broccoli (about 3 large heads or 6 smaller ones).", "2 pounds summer squash (about 6 medium zucchini), trimmed and cut into 1-inch long pieces on a bias.", "2 pounds cauliflower or broccoli romanesco (about 1 large head or 2 smaller heads).
