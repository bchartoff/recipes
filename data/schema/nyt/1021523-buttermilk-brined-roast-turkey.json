The trickiest step will be pulling out your kitchen scale to weigh out the salt, but it's worth doing if you can to ensure a properly seasoned turkey. The acid in the buttermilk leads to moist, tender meat throughout, while the sugars result in a gorgeous golden-brown skin. This turkey is spatchcocked, which might sound like a lot, but it\u2019s just another way to simplify the recipe: By removing the backbone before brining, you\u2019ll be able to fit the turkey, placed in a 2-gallon plastic resealable bag, in the fridge more easily. And you\u2019ll get a lot more of that beautiful lacquered skin in about half the cooking time. It\u2019s a total win-win situation. Just make sure you don\u2019t skimp on the brining time; 48 hours is essential to make sure the bird gets seasoned through and through.
