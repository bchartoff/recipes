{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oklahoma Onion Burgers", "description": "Homer Davis and his son Ross invented what he called the Depression burger at the Hamburger Inn in El Reno, Okla., as a means to add inexpensive bulk to their burgers. Rather than toasting, the buns are steamed in onion-scented vapor. That the technique \u2014 cooking the patties smashed-style with a huge amount of thinly shaved onions and steaming the buns \u2014 and restaurant remain popular to this day is a testament to the burgers\u2019 deliciousness. If you prefer, you can take the cooking (and the accompanying lingering onion aroma) completely out of the house by heating the skillet or griddle directly over a very hot grill and cooking outdoors (see Tip).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
