{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Babka Rugelach", "description": "These festive, fudgy confections are a mash-up of two traditional Jewish favorites: rugelach and chocolate babka. They have a tender, flaky pastry wrapped around a bittersweet truffle-like filling that\u2019s sprinkled with chopped nuts or cocoa nibs for a contrasting crunch. A topping of Demerara sugar adds texture, and a little flaky sea salt cuts the sweetness perfectly. These are best served within five days of baking (store them in an airtight container at room temperature). They also freeze well for up to one month, with parchment or waxed paper between layers.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08cookiesrex16-rugelach/merlin_198260691_9e52c301-efe9-4468-9371-4b8ff525f734-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 dozen rugelach", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, christmas cookie, cocoa powder, cream cheese, freezer friendly, make-ahead, christmas, hanukkah", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 469}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (8-ounce/225-gram) block cream cheese, softened", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pans, if you like", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "6 tablespoons/88 milliliters heavy cream", "Pinch of fine sea or table salt", "3 ounces/85 grams extra bittersweet chocolate, preferably 66 to 74 percent cocoa, coarsely chopped", "1/4 cup/61 grams unsalted butter, diced, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/63 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons/45 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons/11 grams cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "4 1/2 tablespoons/64 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/2 cup/75 grams finely chopped toasted nuts, such as pistachios, walnuts, or pecans, or use cocoa nibs", "2 tablespoons Demerara sugar, for sprinkling", "Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling\u00a0", "Milk, for brushing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a hand-held electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter on medium speed until smooth and well blended.
