{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pan Shrimp Scampi With Crispy Gnocchi", "description": "The best part of shrimp scampi is arguably the garlicky sauce, usually poured over pasta or mopped up with bread. This recipe offers another take: Pillows of potato gnocchi are crisped in a skillet that is then used to cook the shrimp. The gnocchi add heft, and their soft yet chewy texture goes nicely with the springiness of the shrimp. Serve this with a big green salad to round out the meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/26/dining/19apperex-scampi/merlin_215115261_245ab5df-fe2a-4aad-822c-e49b9a747e30-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, pastas, seafood, main course", "keywords": "dry white wine, garlic, gnocchi, italian american, shrimp, skillet", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1033}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 pound gnocchi (fresh, frozen or shelf-stable)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1/2 cup dry white wine (or clam juice, or broth)", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and freshly ground black pepper", "1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "1 pound large or extra-large shrimp, shelled (deveined, if you like)", "1 lemon", "1/2 cup chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, preferably nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high.
