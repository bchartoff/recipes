{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach Poundcake", "description": "This recipe proves that the perfect summer pound cake takes no special equipment or skill to pull off. Once you\u2019ve prepared the peaches, this is essentially a dump-and-whisk cake. Pur\u00e9ed peaches (plus an extra egg yolk) keep the cake from drying out. Diced peaches add bursts of fresh fruit,  and a peach glaze lends another layer of flavor. Use sweet, ripe peaches for best results, but frozen work fine here, too. If you\u2019re looking for a spin on classic peaches and cream, serve a slice with lightly sweetened whipped cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/28/dining/jg-peach-pound-cake/jg-peach-pound-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "1 (9-by-5-inch) cake", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "butter, flour, peach, vanilla, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2812}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/230 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), melted and cooled to room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan", "3 medium, ripe, red-hued peaches (about 1 pound), pitted (see Note)", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "3 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk, beaten", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 cup/125 grams unsifted confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more as needed", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
