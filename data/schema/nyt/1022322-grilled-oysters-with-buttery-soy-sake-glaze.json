Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt first saw the pairing of oysters with sweet soy and sake sauce as a cook at Uni in Boston. It\u2019s based on kabayaki, Japanese-style grilled freshwater eel. Eel is much richer than oysters, so adding a touch of butter to the sauce before spooning it over the grilled oysters helps balance the flavors. The sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks.
