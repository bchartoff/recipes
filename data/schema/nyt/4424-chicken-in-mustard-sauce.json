{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken in Mustard Sauce", "description": "This healthy yet elegant weeknight chicken dish came to The Times in 1988, courtesy of Jacques P\u00e9pin. It's simple but loaded with flavor, and you can throw it together in about a half hour. Just saut\u00e9 the chicken until golden, then make a quick sauce from onions, water and mustard and reduce until thick. Serve with rice to soak up the sauce, and a crisp green salad. If white meat is not your thing, it would be equally delicious made with boneless chicken thighs (just be sure to add a few minutes of cooking time).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacques P\u00e9pin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/15/dining/15RECIPE17DIN/15RECIPE17DIN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "chicken breast, dijon mustard, onion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1663}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "241 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 5-ounce chicken breasts, skinless and boneless", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1 cup onion, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons flour", "2 cups water", "1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sprinkle the meat with the salt and pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
