{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Florida Lime Pie", "description": "Jane Nickerson was the food editor of The New York Times from 1942 until 1957, when she moved with her family to Lakeland, Fla. There, she eventually became food editor of The Ledger, in Lakeland, then owned by The Times. Her successor in New York was Craig Claiborne, whose star eclipsed hers for, among other things, systemic reasons we wrestle with still. But Ms. Nickerson was a hugely influential force in American home cooking, introducing ingredients and recipes from chefs and home cooks to a nation that met her first on a wartime footing and grew to find itself on a prosperous one. In Florida, she embraced local ingredients and foodways, and in 1973 published \u201cJane Nickerson\u2019s Florida Cookbook,\u201d an invaluable guide to the state\u2019s appetizing abundance. Her lime pie is a little richer than the more well-known Key lime pie. I like that about it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/11/magazine/11mag-eat/11mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 (9-inch) pie", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "birthday, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, new year\u2019s day, butter, flour, lime, lime juice, sweetened condensed milk, whipped cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 719}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "3 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed", "5 large egg yolks, plus 3 large egg whites, all at room temperature", "1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "2/3 cup fresh lime juice (from about 4 to 5 limes)", "1 tablespoon finely grated lime zest, plus more for garnish", "Whipped cream, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.
