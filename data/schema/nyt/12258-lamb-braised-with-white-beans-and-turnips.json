{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Braised With White Beans and Turnips", "description": "Bordeaux is more distinctive for wines than food, though its vinously sauced dishes are famous, as is its lamb from Pauillac. Indeed, while tasting, it struck me that succulent lamb, with slightly gamy fat, would best unpin the tight embrace of the 2008 vintage from the M\u00e9doc. I braised chunks of lamb shoulder in wine, gave the dish an edge with lemon zest and white turnips, and added buttery white beans, a classic partner for lamb. If you like canned beans, rinse and drain them, and add in place of the cooked beans, with the turnips, during final simmering.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/04/dining/04PAIR_SPAN/04PAIR_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, dry white wine, lamb, turnip, white beans, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 29}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1179, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "81 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "64 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "sodiumContent": "1813 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup dried white cannellini, Tarbais or great northern beans", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "3 pounds lamb shoulder in 2-inch chunks, with bone", "Salt and black pepper", "8 medium white turnips (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and quartered", "1 cup (about 2) finely chopped leeks", "4 large cloves garlic, sliced", "Grated zest of 1 lemon", "1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves, plus sprigs for garnish", "1 1/2 cups dry white wine", "1 1/2 cups veal or chicken stock (a bit more if reheating; see Step 5)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place beans in a bowl, cover with water to a depth of 2 inches and soak 8 hours or overnight."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil on medium-high in a 4-quart stovetop casserole or deep saut\u00e9 pan.
