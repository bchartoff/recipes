Saut\u00e9\u00a0celery, zucchini and scallions with a glug of olive oil, then add canned beans and cook until warmed. If you prefer a thicker sauce, add the beans at the beginning of cooking so they break down as they\u2019re stirred. Serve with grilled bread, pearl couscous or farro. Soft herbs like basil or parsley, tender greens like arugula or m\u00e2che, or pesto or salsa verde would all make for a lovely garnish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/19/dining/aw-celery-white-bean-ragout/aw-celery-white-bean-ragout-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, for one, for two, lunch, quick, weekday, beans, soups and stews, vegetables", "keywords": "cannellini beans, celery, pesto, scallion, zucchini, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 337}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup vegetable stock, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "4 stalks celery, thinly sliced on an angle, leaves reserved", "2 medium zucchini (about 7 ounces each), trimmed, quartered lengthwise then cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 scallions, thinly sliced on an angle", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, mascarpone or sour cream, for serving", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2653-basic-pesto\">Pesto</a>, for serving", "Cooked pearl couscous or grilled bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the stock, oil, celery, zucchini and scallions in a large, deep skillet; season generously with salt and pepper.
