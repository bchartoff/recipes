But when used properly, it\u2019s a useful tool ideal for crisping chicken skin, charring vegetables and melting cheese. Broiling is also a great method for perfectly cooking salmon: It yields a deeply browned crust and a tender center that isn\u2019t overcooked. All broilers are different, and knowing the strength of yours and being aware of any uneven \u201chot spots\u201d help maximize the efficiency of it. (As your dish cooks, look to see if it\u2019s cooking evenly across the surface, which will tell you if you need to move things around.) In this recipe, soy-and-mustard-coated salmon and asparagus cook under the broiler, and are topped with an herb salad for a hit of brightness, freshness and acidity.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/18/dining/yf-broiled-salmon-and-asparagus/merlin_205522569_97e09b1c-8af7-4a62-b775-6bfe805c6a0e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, herbs, salmon, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 690}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch cilantro, leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped", "1 bunch parsley, leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped", "1 small bunch mint or dill, leaves picked, roughly chopped", "4 scallions, light green and white parts, sliced", "1/4 to \u00bd teaspoon red-pepper flakes, according to taste\u00a0", "3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus more as needed", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "Salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 large bunch asparagus, woody ends trimmed", "4 (4- to 6-ounce) salmon fillets, at least \u00be-inch thick"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium serving bowl, toss together the herbs, scallions, red-pepper flakes, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
