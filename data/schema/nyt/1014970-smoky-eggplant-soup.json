{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Eggplant Soup", "description": "I am a fan of eggplant soup, and this one is a winner, creamy-textured and bright tasting. Charring the eggplant gives it a smoky flavor, but as opposed to some rustic versions, the soup has a smooth texture and a lovely pale color. It gets a good squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of the Middle Eastern spice mixture za\u2019atar, made with wild thyme and sesame, now widely available. Make sure to choose small, firm eggplants. Serve the soup chilled or hot, in small portions.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/14/dining/14KITCH2/14KITCH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, eggplant, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 559}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 173, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1066 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds small firm eggplants", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "2 cups sliced white or yellow onion", "Salt and pepper", "6 garlic cloves, minced", "Pinch cayenne", "6 cups chicken broth or mild vegetable broth", "3 to 4 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "1 tablespoon za\u2019atar, available in Middle Eastern groceries", "2 teaspoons chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Poke 2 or 3 holes in eggplants with a paring knife, then place on a baking sheet under hot broiler, about 2 inches from flame.
