For the most robust peanut flavor, use well-stirred natural, unsweetened peanut butter. You can also use a sweetened variety, if that\u2019s what you have on hand, but bear in mind that the ice cream and honey lend this cake enough sweetness. The savory dry-roasted peanuts add a wonderful depth of flavor, but make sure to look for a brand without onion or garlic powder listed among the ingredients.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/20/dining/ss-salty-peanut-pretzel-cake/merlin_156441087_06106b14-47b9-4011-9e53-54483e195f34-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dessert, honey, ice cream, peanut butter, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 208}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/88 grams mini pretzels", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/42 grams salted peanuts (preferably dry roasted)", "2 tablespoons/25 grams light brown sugar", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "2 quarts/1.9 liters high-quality vanilla ice cream", "3/4 cup/205 grams natural, unsweetened peanut butter, well stirred", "2 tablespoons honey", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
