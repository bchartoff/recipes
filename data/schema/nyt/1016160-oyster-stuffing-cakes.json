{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oyster Stuffing Cakes", "description": "When you get your hands on ice-cold oysters straight from the Chesapeake Bay, it would be foolish to do anything beyond shuck and slurp. But in the 19th century, oysters were so plentiful in eastern Virginia and Maryland that they burrowed their way into the region's cooking traditions. Most were smoked and salted, roasted over fire, dropped into chowders and stews and used in stuffings. The chef Peter Woods at Merroir in Topping, Va., serves this crisp, savory treat in fall and winter as an appetizer, or as a main course with a big winter salad of bitter greens, pears or dried fruit and toasted nuts.<br /><br />Try to buy the oysters for this recipe at a fish store with high turnover and have the counterman shuck them for you; if you can't, even packaged shucked oysters will do fine. They are chopped up small in this recipe so they melt into the bread and herbs, and their briny liquor binds the mixture. You taste umami and butter and salt, but nothing screams \"Oyster!\"", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/23/dining/23OYSTER_395/23OYSTER_395-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bacon, bread, oyster", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 28}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 272, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "386 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pint (about 2 dozen) Eastern (virginica) shucked oysters with their liquor, finely chopped", "12 ounces stale bread cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "3 ounces (about 1/3 cup) freshly grated Parmesan", "1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter", "3 slices bacon, chopped", "4 stalks celery, chopped", "1 onion, chopped", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock, plus extra for binding", "2 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped fine, or 1 tablespoon dried", "2 tablespoons fresh thyme, chopped fine, or 1 tablespoon dried", "6 fresh sage leaves, minced", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "Coarse salt", "Black pepper", "Neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola, for pan-frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine oysters and their liquor, bread and cheese.
