{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meat and Potato Skillet Gratin", "description": "This hearty, wintry dish is a cross between a shepherd's pie and potato gratin. It's got a layer of browned ground beef spiked with onions, sage and spinach on the bottom, with a luscious, cheese- and cream-slathered root vegetable topping that turns golden and crisp-edged in the oven. If you aren't a rutabaga fan, you can use all potatoes, or a combination of white and sweet potatoes. This gratin reheats very well, so feel free to make it ahead and reheat it uncovered in a 350-degree oven. And although it qualifies as a one-pan meal (with meat, green vegetable and starch altogether), a fresh and tangy green salad on the side would round things out nicely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/20/multimedia/clark-meat-pie/clark-meat-pie-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "beef, potato, rutabaga, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 859}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 410, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "499 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 garlic cloves", "1 cup heavy cream", "2 thyme branches", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1 pound ground lean beef ", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "1 cup thinly sliced onion", "3 ounces baby spinach (3 packed cups)", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1/2 pound rutabaga", "1/2 pound russet potatoes", "4 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, grated (1 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Crush and peel 2 garlic cloves.
