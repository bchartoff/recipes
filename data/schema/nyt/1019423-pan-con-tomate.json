{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan Con Tomate", "description": "Some version of tomatoes on toast \u2014 a juicy American B.L.T. or Italian tomato-topped bruschetta \u2014 is always a good idea, but that's especially true during high summer, when tomatoes are at their peak. One superior combination comes from Barcelona, where a slice of toast is rubbed with garlic and juicy ripe tomatoes, then anointed with olive oil. Most Catalan cooks simply cut the tomato crosswise and vigorously massage the toasted bread with the cut side. Others grate the tomato flesh and spoon it over the bread. This version adds tomato slices and a scattering of cherry tomatoes for a substantial first course.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/25/dining/25Kitchrex/merlin_140281260_8ed91524-a231-443c-88ba-bed9b26a7448-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, weekday, finger foods, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "basil, cherry tomatoes, sourdough, tomatoes, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 794}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 282, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "597 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 or 4 very ripe medium tomatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "1 pint cherry tomatoes (about 12 ounces)", "4 to 6 large slices sturdy sourdough bread, about 1/2-inch thick", "4 to 6 garlic cloves, peeled", "Salt and pepper", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Basil leaves, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut 2 tomatoes in half crosswise.
