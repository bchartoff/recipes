Sumac doesn\u2019t get a lot of love in American kitchens, even though edible sumac species grow wild throughout America and are essential in the Indigenous American kitchen. Dr. Cynthia Greenlee wrote about how <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/dining/black-foragers-nature-alexis-nelson.html\"> foraging is back in style</a> for a new generation of Black Americans. If you want to forage for the wild variety of sumac and dry and prepare the spice at home, the fall season is the time to do it. Look for sumac with red berry clusters, such as staghorn sumac. Be sure to avoid berries of any other color, which may be poison sumac.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nicole Taylor"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/08/dining/06JuneteenthREX4-Strawberry-Sumac-Cake/merlin_207642174_32f709d5-7eff-4f62-9d4d-4ed2bc95e7d2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "strawberries, sumac, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 304}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup chopped hulled strawberries (1-inch pieces), plus 1 cup strawberries, halved\u00a0", "1 teaspoon ground sumac", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "\u00bd teaspoon almond extract", "1 cup/240 milliliters plus 1 tablespoon olive oil\u00a0", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/152 grams stone-ground yellow cornmeal", "\u00bd teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "\u00bd teaspoon baking soda", "\u00bd teaspoon baking powder\u00a0", "3 large eggs", "1 cup/200 grams plus 2 tablespoons/25 grams granulated sugar", "\u00bd cup/120 milliliters half-and-half", "\u00bc teaspoon ground sumac"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the strawberries: Combine the chopped strawberries, sumac, sugar and almond extract in a small bowl and set aside to macerate, a process of letting the berries soften and release their juices."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, prepare the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
