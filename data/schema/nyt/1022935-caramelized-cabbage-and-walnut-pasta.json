{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Cabbage and Walnut Pasta", "description": "A single, modest cabbage goes a long way in this recipe. Green cabbage (though you could also use Savoy) becomes jammy and sweet when cooked with aromatic leeks and garlic for 15 minutes, a practically effortless concoction to toss with pasta. Cumin seeds add just the right amount of earthiness along with a subtle citrus tone; add more if you want a pronounced flavor, or substitute with fennel seeds or caraway. The walnuts balance out the sweetness of the cabbage and leeks, and introduce a slight bitterness and crunch. Store-bought roasted walnuts are a time saver here, but if you want them extra dark and crispy, toast them for 6 to 8 minutes in a 325-degree oven until deeply golden. If you have chives or scallions on hand, toss these in at the end for a lively finish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/25/dining/hm-cabbage-leek-walnut-pasta/merlin_200287722_fc9201ff-c6c4-458f-8df2-0ad0b8a5a1b5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "green cabbage, leek, pecorino, spaghetti, walnut, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1934}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "3 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "2 leeks, white and tender green parts, thinly sliced into rings", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 pounds finely sliced green cabbage", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 pound spaghetti or other long pasta", "4 ounces pecorino, grated, plus more for serving", "2 to 3 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed", "3 to 4 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)", "1 to 1\u00bd cups toasted walnuts, roughly chopped", "Handful of chopped chives (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large Dutch oven or pot over medium.
