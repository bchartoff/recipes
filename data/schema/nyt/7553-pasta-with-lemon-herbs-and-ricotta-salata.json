It's easy yet elegant; perfect for a impromptu weeknight dinner party. If you can get your hands on a Meyer lemon, do so and use that, but the recipe works just as well with a standard lemon from the corner deli.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/16/dining/ricotta-salata-pasta/ricotta-salata-pasta-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "lemon, pasta, ricotta, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 406}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 530, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "92 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "728 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "1 clove garlic, peeled and lightly smashed", "Grated zest of 1 lemon (Meyer, if available)", "Juice of 1 lemon (Meyer, if available), plus more to taste", "Coarse sea salt or kosher salt", "1 pound pappardelle, broken into 2-inch pieces, or fusilli", "3 tablespoons chopped mint", "2 tablespoons chopped marjoram", "1 tablespoon chopped fennel fronds or tarragon", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for sprinkling", "6 ounces ricotta salata", "Coarsely ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large pot with water and add enough salt so that you can taste it.
