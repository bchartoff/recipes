{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Bean Cakes With Harissa, Lemon and Herbs", "description": "This recipe embraces any beans you\u2019ve got in your pantry. Canned beans are easiest, but fresh shelled beans can be ready to go with a quick blanching, and dried beans can be used, too, if they\u2019ve been soaked and cooked in advance. Toss the well-drained beans with harissa (or any red chile paste), scallions, herbs, lemon zest, cornstarch and a lightly whipped egg white. (The egg white and cornstarch give these bean cakes their crispness.) Shape them into patties for frying, and slice some lemon wedges for serving. Eat the patties as a vegetarian main dish, a side to roast chicken or fish, or as a snack with a dash of harissa.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/06/dining/yk-crispy-bean-cakes/yk-crispy-bean-cakes-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings (10 bean cakes)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, beans, vegetables, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cilantro, coriander, cumin, dill, egg, harissa, lemon, scallion, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2071}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (15-ounce) cans beans, such as black-eyed peas, chickpeas, pinto, kidney or black beans, drained (about 3 cups)", "1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, chopped, plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped, plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup sliced scallions", "3 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 tablespoon harissa, plus more for serving", "3/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 lemon, zested and cut into wedges", "1 egg white", "6 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "Labneh or full-fat Greek yogurt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the drained beans in a large bowl and crush using a fork or your fingers until coarsely mashed.
