{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sugar Snap Peas With Yogurt, Feta and Dill", "description": "Much of the appeal of sugar snap peas comes from their juicy, sweet crunch, which means you\u2019ll want to take care when blanching them. They turn from perfectly crisp-tender to soft in seconds. The key is to have a bowl of salted ice water next to the stove and a slotted spoon at the ready. The salt in the ice water seasons the peas, and the ice stops them from overcooking. In this savory salad, they\u2019re tossed with a garlicky dressing for brightness, and a creamy feta-yogurt sauce for richness. Serve them with crusty bread as a summery appetizer, or as a side dish for grilled fish or meats.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/17/dining/12apperex/merlin_173401746_5f81ca8f-38e4-46f9-a29c-54aab354360f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "dill, fennel, feta, scallion, snap peas, yogurt, spring, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 397}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for water and to taste", "1/2 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed (about 3 cups)", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "Freshly ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 cup thinly sliced fennel, or use radish or cucumber", "1/2 packed cup roughly chopped fresh dill, or use a combination of dill and fennel fronds", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "1/3 cup plain whole-milk yogurt (if using Greek, thin it down with milk or water until pourable)", "1/2 cup crumbled feta (about 2 ounces)", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "Torn soft herbs, such as mint, basil, parsley, tarragon, chives, cilantro or a combination, for serving", "Crusty bread, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
