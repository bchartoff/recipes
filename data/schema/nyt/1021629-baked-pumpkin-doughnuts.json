{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Pumpkin Doughnuts", "description": "These fuss-free (no electric mixer needed!) pumpkin doughnuts are flavored with cinnamon and nutmeg, classic spices we associate with fall. But they\u2019re also loaded with pumpkin pure\u00e9, which makes them moist and flavorful and gives them their orangey hue. They\u2019re finished with a simple \u2014 and forgiving \u2014 vanilla glaze that sets beautifully. If your glaze is too thick to dip, just add a little more milk. If your glaze is too thin and runs off the doughnut, add a little more confectioners\u2019 sugar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/09/dining/vl-pumpkin-doughnuts/vl-pumpkin-doughnuts-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "12 doughnuts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "cinnamon, doughnut, oil, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, fall, halloween, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 297}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 2/3 cups/215 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters vegetable oil", "2 large eggs", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup/240 milliliters canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whole milk", "1 cup/100 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more if needed", "2 tablespoons whole milk, plus more if needed", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 375 degrees.
