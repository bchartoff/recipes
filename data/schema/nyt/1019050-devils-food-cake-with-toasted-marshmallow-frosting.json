The cake looks intimidating at first, but Ms. Parks's technique involves simply stirring all the ingredients together in a single 5-quart pan and then pouring it into 3 pans. Once they're cooled, level the puffy tops with a bread knife and put them together with marshmallow frosting for a true showstopper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/19/magazine/19feast3/19feast3-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cocoa powder, coffee, dark chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 221}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 627, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "97 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "442 milligrams", "sugarContent": "78 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups (340 grams/3 sticks) butter", "1 1/2 cups (354 milliliters) black coffee", "1 cup (85 grams) Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "1 1/4 cups (170 grams) finely chopped dark chocolate (about 72 percent)", "2 packed cups plus 1 tablespoon (453 grams) light-brown sugar", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt", "6 large eggs", "3 large egg yolks", "2 cups (255 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking soda", "1 cup (226 grams) egg whites", "1 3/4 cups (340 grams) sugar", "1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place oven rack in the middle position, and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
