{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta Primavera With Asparagus and Peas", "description": "This simple pasta primavera uses a combination of the earliest vegetables available in spring \u2014 asparagus, peas and spring onions \u2014 making it a true celebration of the season. The sauce works best with springy egg pasta, preferably homemade or a good purchased brand. Make sure not to overcook it; you need the chewy bite to stand up to the gently cooked vegetables. If you can\u2019t find good fresh English peas, you can substitute frozen peas, but don\u2019t add them until the last minute of cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/dining/13BIGAPPETITE2/13BIGAPPETITE2-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, pastas", "keywords": "asparagus, english peas, fettuccine, snap peas, spring onions, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1985}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 553, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "576 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 pound sugar snap peas, stems trimmed", "1/2 pound asparagus, ends snapped", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3/4 cup fresh English peas", "1/4 cup thinly sliced spring onion, white part only (or use shallot)", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, more as needed", "Black pepper, more as needed", "12 ounces fettuccine or tagliatelle, preferably fresh (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017391-fresh-egg-pasta\">see recipe</a>)", "2/3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, at room temperature", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or whole milk Greek yogurt, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley", "1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over medium-high heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "While the water is coming to a boil, slice snap peas and asparagus stems into 1/4-inch-thick pieces; leave asparagus tips whole."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
