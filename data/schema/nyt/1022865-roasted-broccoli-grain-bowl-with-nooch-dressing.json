{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Broccoli Grain Bowl With Nooch Dressing", "description": "This nutty, savory and deeply satisfying \u2014 not to mention vegan \u2014 grain bowl stands out because of a stellar sauce made of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/dining/nutritional-yeast-nooch.html\">nutritional yeast</a> (also known as \u201cnooch\u201d), lemon, mustard and garlic powder that provides umami, brightness and spunk. The sauce works especially well on roasted brassicas like broccoli, cauliflower and brussels sprouts, likely because the combination is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019106-broccoli-and-cheddar-soup\">broccoli-Cheddar soup</a>. Keep a jar of the stuff on hand for grain bowls on demand. (It keeps for three days in the fridge.) Cook any cold-weather vegetables, use any leftover grains, incorporate any crunch, and maybe even add dill, apples or celery for freshness. The sauce will tie it all together.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/05/dining/as-broccoli-grain-bowl/merlin_195505161_600c7e9d-511b-4a91-aed3-da9a67f256cf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, grain bowl, grains, nutritional yeast, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1740}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds broccoli, cauliflower or a combination, cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch-long florets, stem sliced 1/4-inch-thick, leaves reserved", "1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved", "3/4 cup olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup nutritional yeast", "Zest and juice of 1 large lemon (about 1 teaspoon zest and 3 tablespoons juice)", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "4 cups cooked whole grains (such as farro, quinoa, or wheat berries), warm or room temperature", "1/4 cup roasted, salted almonds, coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven, and heat the oven to 450 degrees.
