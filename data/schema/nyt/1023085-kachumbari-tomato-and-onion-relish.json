Twitty explores the varied cuisines of the global Jewish diaspora. Kachumbari, the Swahili word that means \u201cpickle,\u201d can be traced to Kenya and other East African countries where the tomato and onion mix is served as a salad or relish. This dish exemplifies a tradition of hospitality: Appetizers or snacks\u00a0 \u2014 salatim in Israel, kemia in North Africa and mezze in the Middle East \u2014 are offered to house guests. After tasting the small plates, the visitors then decide if they would like to stay and enjoy the main meal. This deeply flavored kachumbari can be served with nearly any fish or other protein-based dish, and can also be offered alongside plantains, or with hummus and pita.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kayla Stewart"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/06/dining/05passoverrex2/merlin_204759438_113af34b-7d8d-45cd-8ab0-8c4e0436286f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "red onion, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 50}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ripe but firm tomatoes, very thinly sliced", "2 medium red onions, halved then very thinly sliced", "1 carrot, peeled and sliced", "1/2 cucumber, peeled and sliced", "1 lemon, juiced (4 to 5 tablespoons)", "1 tablespoon chrain (beet horseradish) or regular prepared horseradish\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon garam masala or curry powder", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the sliced tomatoes, onions, carrot and cucumber in a bowl.
