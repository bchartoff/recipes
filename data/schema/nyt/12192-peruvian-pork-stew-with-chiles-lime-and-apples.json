{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peruvian Pork Stew With Chiles, Lime and Apples", "description": "Spicy and sweet, this Peruvian stew is rich with apples and onions and scented with chiles, lime and cloves. It\u2019s not at all difficult to make, and it takes less time than you would think, about two hours from start to finish. As you brown the pork on all sides in a pot, saut\u00e9 the onions and apples with the chiles, bay leaves and cloves in another. Combine everything and braise until the pork is very tender and falling apart. If you\u2019d like to make it in a slow cooker, put everything into the crock after browning and saut\u00e9ing and turn the cooker on high. It will be ready in four to six hours.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/Peruvian-pork-stew/Peruvian-pork-stew-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "at least 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "south american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "main course, pork shoulder, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 972}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 635, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "306 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "3 to 4 pounds trimmed boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch pieces", "2 large white onions, chopped", "4 large apples, peeled, cored and roughly chopped", "3 snipped and seeded ancho or other mild dried chiles", "3 bay leaves", "Pinch of ground cloves", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice", "4 cups chicken stock", "Steamed rice for serving", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet and brown the pork in it on all sides; you may have to do this in batches for the most efficient browning.
