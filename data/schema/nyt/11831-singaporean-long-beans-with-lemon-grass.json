Fold the sides of the foil over to form a small parcel, then flatten into a disk 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Set a gas burner to medium-low or an electric burner to medium-high. Using tongs, place the sealed parcel directly on the heat source. Toast until the paste begins to smoke and release a toasted-shrimp smell, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. With the tongs, turn the parcel over and toast for another 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let cool for a minute. Carefully unwrap the foil; the edges of the disk should be black-brown, and the center should be golden with some black-brown patches.
