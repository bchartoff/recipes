{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Double Chocolate Cookies", "description": "With plenty of cocoa powder and big wells of dark chocolate, these double chocolate cookies are so fudgy that a tall glass of cold milk is not only delicious, but essential \u2014 especially when they are served hot from the oven. Just like David Leite\u2019s impeccable chocolate chip cookies, they bake up even better after the dough has had time to rest in the fridge. The extralong chill gives the dough a chance to hydrate fully and firm up, which yields more uniformly baked cookies, with the perfect amount of crunch around the edges and chew in the center. Thin chocolate discs or wafers, which are widely available, are used here. They melt into lovely chocolate layers as the cookies bake. But if you can\u2019t find them, chocolate chips make a fine substitute; there's no need to adjust the baking time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/05/dining/05COOKING-CHOCOLATECHIPCOOKIES1/05COOKING-CHOCOLATECHIPCOOKIES1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "9 to 10 big cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "cocoa powder, semisweet chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 868}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 442, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "235 milligrams", "sugarContent": "47 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/145 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/75 grams Dutch-process cocoa powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "10 tablespoons/141 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/150 grams dark brown sugar", "2/3 cup/133 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "2 cups/305 grams semisweet or bittersweet chocolate discs (or use 2 cups/340 grams chocolate chips)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda.
