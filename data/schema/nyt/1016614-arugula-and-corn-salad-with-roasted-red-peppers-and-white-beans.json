{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arugula and Corn Salad With Roasted Red Peppers and White Beans", "description": "Canned beans can also be used in this composed salad with a base of sweet corn and pungent arugula. Since you don\u2019t need a broth for this composed salad, canned beans will work, though I always prefer the flavor of beans I\u2019ve cooked myself. I like to use a white bean, either a cannellini or a navy bean. I\u2019ve always loved sweet corn with pungent arugula. I combine the two for a salad bed, which I top with the roasted peppers and beans. So the dish is really two salads, one on top of the other.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/01/science/04recipehealth/04recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, high protein, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 95}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 339, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "544 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ear sweet corn", "3 cups baby or wild arugula", "2 red bell peppers, roasted", "1 1/2 cups (1 can) cooked white beans, such as cannellini or navy beans, rinsed if using canned beans", "1 tablespoon chopped chives", "1 tablespoon slivered fresh basil (more to taste)", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "Salt to taste", "1 small garlic clove, pureed or put through a press", "1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/4 cup shaved Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam corn for 4 to 5 minutes, until just tender.
