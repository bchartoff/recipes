{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sausage Rag\u00f9", "description": "Meat sauce is one of the recipes many American home cooks start with. It seems so easy; brown some hamburger, pour in a jar of marinara, and presto! Meat sauce. Not so fast, friends. Made that way, your sauce may be thin-tasting, sour, sweet, or \u2014 worst of all \u2014 dry and chewy. Meat sauce with deep flavor and succulent texture isn\u2019t harder to make; it just needs more time and a low flame. This recipe from the New York chef Sara Jenkins, who grew up in Tuscany and has cooked all over Italy, shows how it\u2019s done. Caramelization is involved; dried pasta and canned tomatoes are best practice; and pork, not beef, is the meat of choice. \u00a0If your sausage meat seems timidly flavored, feel free to add chopped garlic, chile flakes, fennel seed and/or dried herbs like oregano and sage to the meat as it browns.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/01/multimedia/recipe-lab-ragout/recipe-lab-ragout-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "main course, sausage, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1539}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 276, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "321 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound sweet Italian sausage or bulk sausage", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 onion, minced", "1 carrot, minced", "1 celery stalk, minced", "1/4 cup minced flat-leaf parsley, plus extra for garnish", "1 28-ounce can whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano, with its juice", "1 large sprig fresh thyme", "1 large sprig fresh rosemary", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "Salt", "Ground black pepper", "1 pound tubular dried pasta such as mezzi rigatoni, paccheri or penne", "Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish, optional\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "With the tip of a small, sharp knife, slit open the sausage casings.
