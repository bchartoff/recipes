Black beans shine in a deep-red mixture of fried garlic, caramelized tomato paste, smoked paprika and cumin. The whole skillet gets coated in a generous sprinkling of sharp Cheddar or Manchego cheese, then baked until melted. The final result is what you hope for from a really good chili or stew, but in a lot less time. For a spicier rendition, add a pinch of cayenne with the paprika, or douse the final skillet with hot sauce. Serve with tortillas, tortilla chips, rice, a baked potato or fried eggs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/20/dining/as-black-bean-bake/as-black-bean-bake-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, beans", "keywords": "black beans, cheddar, cumin, garlic, smoked paprika, tomato paste, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2386}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "5 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced", "1/4 cup tomato paste", "1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 (14-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed", "1/2 cup boiling water", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 cups grated Cheddar or Manchego cheese (from about a 6-ounce block)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 475 degrees.
