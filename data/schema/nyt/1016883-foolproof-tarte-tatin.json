With just four ingredients, it's all about the apples: the lovely taste and shape of the fruit are preserved by sugar and heat, with a buttery-salty crust underneath. This recipe from Gotham Bar and Grill in New York has a couple of tricks that make it easier to pull off than others: dry the apples out before baking; start by coating the pan with butter instead of making a caramel; use tall chunks of apple and hug them together in the pan to prevent overcooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/29/dining/29COOKING-TARTTAITIN1/29COOKING-TARTTAITIN1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pies and tarts", "keywords": "apples, puff pastry, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1335}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 242, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "78 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 to 8 large, firm-fleshed apples, preferably Braeburn, or use a mix of Honeycrisp and Granny Smith", "6 tablespoons/80 grams salted butter, very soft", "2/3 cup/135 grams granulated or light brown sugar", "1 sheet all-butter puff pastry, about 8 ounces (store-bought is fine)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "At least one day before you plan to cook the tart, prepare the apples: Slice off the bottom of each apple so it has a flat base.
