{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Tofu", "description": "Pouring hot marinade over tofu slices encourages faster absorption of flavors, eliminating the need to marinate overnight. In a pinch, this method yields tasty results in three hours, but the recommended six hours deliver a much more complex, richer flavored tofu. Grilled, it makes a versatile side dish and is delicious warm or at room temperature. Pair it with steamed rice and a simple green salad, or turn the tofu into satisfying vegetarian sandwiches by tucking it into pita bread with lettuce and avocado.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/07/dining/kc-grilled-tofu/merlin_188793726_1f3be280-a783-4157-ae41-c8a64a8785b7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, beans, main course", "keywords": "extra-firm tofu, plan-ahead, soy sauce, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1176}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) block extra-firm tofu, sliced crosswise into eight equal slices (about 1/2-inch thick)", "2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil, plus more for greasing grates", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons turbinado sugar", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "2 tablespoons chopped scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange sliced tofu in a single layer on a paper towel-lined plate.
