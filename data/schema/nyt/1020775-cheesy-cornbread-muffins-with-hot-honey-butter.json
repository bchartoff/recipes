{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Cornbread Muffins With Hot Honey Butter", "description": "Smoky chipotle takes these muffins into savory territory, but this recipe can be used purely as a blueprint: Want them a bit sweeter? Lose the minced chipotle chiles, and increase the sugar by a couple of tablespoons. Need them to hold up to a heavily spiced pot of chili? Double the chipotles en adobo, add 1/4 cup minced red onion and a dash of ground cumin, onion powder or garlic, perhaps. Whatever you add, don\u2019t overmix: Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined (a few lumps are O.K.) before folding in the cheese for muffins that are rich but not dense.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/01/dining/aw-cornbread-muffins/merlin_166828473_2710d142-94cd-451b-a259-8ff45b86cf27-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads, quick breads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, cheddar, chipotles in adobo, cornmeal", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 229}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), softened", "3 tablespoons honey", "1 1/2 teaspoons chipotle en adobo sauce", "Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan", "1 1/4 cups/195 grams medium cornmeal", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/4 teaspoons black pepper", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick)", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters sour cream", "2 large eggs", "2 tablespoons minced chiles en adobo (optional)", "1 cup/115 grams grated sharp white Cheddar (about 3 ounces)", "3 tablespoons very thinly sliced scallions or chives", "Sliced jalape\u00f1o, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the hot honey butter: In a small bowl, stir 1/2 cup/1 stick softened butter with the honey and chipotle en adobo sauce.
