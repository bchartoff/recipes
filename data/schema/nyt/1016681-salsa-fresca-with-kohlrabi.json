{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salsa Fresca with Kohlrabi", "description": "Kohlrabi, with its crisp texture, is a pleasant surprise diced into this tomato salsa. It goes well with chips, nachos, tacos and quesadillas, or with fish and chicken. For the past month, I\u2019ve been a guest on the New York Times\u2019s Motherlode Blog, helping out Renee Ruder and her family in Bend, Ore., put more vegetarian meals on the table using produce they receive in their community-supported agriculture basket each week. She received kohlrabi one week and was at a loss as to what to do with it. I had some suggestions for ways to use the vegetable in main dishes, and now I\u2019ve come up with a way to use it in a side. The kohlrabi has a crisp texture much like that of jicama, with a nice cruciferous flavor. This salsa fresca would be welcome with just about any tostada, nacho or taco, with chips, or as a condiment with fish or chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/29/science/29recipehealth/29recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "About 2 1/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low calorie, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, vegan, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 27, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "294 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup finely chopped red or white onion", "1/2 medium kohlrabi (about 1/2 pound), cut in small dice (1 cup)", "1 pound ripe tomatoes, diced (2 cups)", "1 to 2 serrano or jalepe\u00f1o chiles (or more, to taste), minced", "1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped cilantro (to taste)", "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (to taste)", "Salt to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place onion in a small bowl and cover with cold water.
