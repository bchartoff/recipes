{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Wild Rice and Roasted Squash Salad With Cider Vinaigrette", "description": "Toothsome wild rice, caramelized roasted veggies and crisp radicchio all shine in this generous salad, which can be served as a hearty side or satisfying lunch. Radicchio adds a pop of color and a punch of bitterness, but a peppery green like arugula would also make a great substitute. This salad is tossed with a generous batch of mustard-cider vinaigrette. If you decide to double the dressing or have any left over, it pairs beautifully with just about any grain or hearty green, and will keep refrigerated for up to three days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/23/dining/ya-wild-rice-salad/merlin_178752171_3966ca16-dea6-42a3-a37e-d55c86283193-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "apple cider, butternut squash, radicchio, smoked paprika, wild rice, fall, winter, thanksgiving, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 374}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup uncooked wild rice (about 5 ounces)", "3/4 pound peeled kabocha or butternut squash, cut into 3/4-inch pieces (about 3 cups)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1/2 small head radicchio, thinly sliced", "1/2 cup sweetened dried cherries", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves and tender stems", "1/3 cup toasted chopped walnuts", "Flaky sea salt", "1 cup fresh apple cider", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar", "1 teaspoon minced shallot", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the center of the oven."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the rice: Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.
