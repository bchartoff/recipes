Homemade pastry always tastes better. Make it the day before. You can even roll it out, line the tart pan and keep it frozen until you\u2019re ready to bake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/dining/Short-Crust-Pastry/Short-Crust-Pastry-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "One 9 and 1/2-inch tart crust", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "butter, flour, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 290}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1268, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "95 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "93 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "58 grams", "sodiumContent": "658 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "4 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["145 grams all-purpose flour (about 1 cup)", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 stick cold unsalted butter (1/4 pound), cut in 1/8-inch pieces", "3 tablespoons ice water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer or food processor.
