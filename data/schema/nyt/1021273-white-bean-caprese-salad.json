{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Bean Caprese Salad", "description": "Beloved pantry white beans add substance to this take on caprese salad, which comes together in no time. It\u2019s a perfect side for grilled chicken or fish, and can be easily doubled to work as a main course when it\u2019s too hot to turn on the oven. If you\u2019re so inclined, a handful of spicy arugula, thinly sliced roasted red peppers or ribbons of prosciutto \u2014 or all three \u2014 would also be nice additions. This dish is easily transportable and tastier when eaten while sitting in a lawn chair.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/25/dining/ch-white-bean-caprese-salad/ch-white-bean-caprese-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "basil, cherry tomatoes, grape tomato, mozzarella, picnic, salad, white beans, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2461}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) can white beans, such as cannellini, rinsed", "5 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, halved", "5 ounces ciliegine (small mozzarella balls), at room temperature, halved lengthwise, or good-quality fresh mozzarella, torn into bite-size pieces", "1/4 cup loosely packed basil leaves, torn if large", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 teaspoons good-quality balsamic vinegar, plus more as needed", "Flaky salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine the beans, tomatoes, cheese and half the basil.
