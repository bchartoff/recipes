{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Sausages With Caramelized Shallots and Apples", "description": "In this rustic sheet-pan dinner, apples and shallots roast slowly alongside pork sausage, becoming fragrant and caramelized in the process. A quick toss with whole-grain mustard and apple cider vinegar adds a savory edge, making the apple and shallot mixture almost reminiscent of chutney. This recipe works equally well with both sweet and hot pork sausage, as well as any crisp apples, though a mix of red and green apples looks particularly nice. Serve with French green lentils and a green salad, with plenty of Dijon mustard on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/27/dining/27SheetPan-sausage-w-apples-and-shallots/merlin_180213297_7f1818a7-cb80-4951-8786-ddea42a4941e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, sausages, main course", "keywords": "apple, mustard, sausage, shallot, sheet-pan, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3126}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 shallots, trimmed on both ends and peeled (about 6 ounces)", "2 crisp apples (preferably one tart, like Granny Smith, and one sweet, like Fuji)", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound sweet or hot Italian sausages", "3 fresh rosemary sprigs", "1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard", "1 to 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar, to taste", "Chopped fresh parsley, for serving\u00a0(optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
