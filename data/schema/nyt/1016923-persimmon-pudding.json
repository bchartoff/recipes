{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Persimmon Pudding", "description": "Wild persimmons start to blush along the country roads of Indiana in late September, stealing the colors of sunset and weighing down their trees like Christmas balls. They are native to the landscape, unlike the Chinese and Japanese varieties cultivated in California and found in grocery stores. Foraging carries on through November, when the fruit claims a place at the Hoosier Thanksgiving table in the form of a dark gold pudding, distant kin to the sweet persimmon bread offered to early colonials by the Cherokee.\nThis recipe comes from Alverta S. Hart of Mitchell, Ind. This fall, the town hosted its annual Persimmon Festival and as always, the most suspenseful event was the persimmon pudding contest. Ms. Hart submitted her first pudding in 1962 as an 18-year-old bride, and re-entered every year for nearly four decades until she became a judge, then chairwoman of the event, winning on and off and collecting every color of ribbon along the way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19INDIANA/19INDIANA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, custards and puddings", "keywords": "persimmon, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 167}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 478, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "85 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "443 milligrams", "sugarContent": "42 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/56 grams butter, melted, plus more for the dish", "5 Fuyu persimmons (about 2 1/4 pounds), trimmed and chopped", "2 eggs, beaten", "2 cups/400 grams sugar", "1 teaspoon/8 grams baking soda", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "2 1/2 teaspoons/12 grams baking powder", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1/4 teaspoon/ 1 1/2 grams salt", "1/2 teaspoon/3 milliliters vanilla extract", "Dash of cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees and butter a 2-quart baking dish.
