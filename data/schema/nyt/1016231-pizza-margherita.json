{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pizza Margherita", "description": "Here is the archetype of a thin-crust pizza pie, a pizza margherita adorned simply in the colors of the Italian flag: green from basil, white from mozzarella, red from tomato sauce. This pizza is adapted from the recipe used by the staff at Roberta\u2019s restaurant in Brooklyn, who make their tomato sauce simply by whizzing together canned tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. The ingredients offer in their proportions what appears to be a kind of austerity \u2014 not even 3 ounces of cheese! But the result is home-cooked pizza to beat the band, exactly the sort of recipe to start a career in home pizza-making, and to return to again and again.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/09/dining/09JPPIZZA2/09JPPIZZA2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, mozzarella, pizza dough, tomato sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1089}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 453, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1052 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 12-inch round of pizza dough, stretched <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016230-robertas-pizza-dough\">(see recipe)</a>", "3 tablespoons tomato sauce (see note)", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 3/4 ounces fresh mozzarella", "4 to 5 basil leaves, roughly torn"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn heat to its highest setting.
