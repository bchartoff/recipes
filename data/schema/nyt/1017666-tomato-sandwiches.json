This version, based on pan con tomate, involves rubbing the guts of a ripe tomato all over garlicky toasted bread. More tomato slices are added on top, along with slivers of onion and mayonnaise, and bacon if you'd like. It\u2019s a supremely messy sandwich best munched over the sink, or with plenty of napkins nearby.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/02/dining/tomato-sandwich-reshoot/tomato-sandwich-reshoot-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy, lunch, quick, sandwiches", "keywords": "main course, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 470}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 slices crusty country bread", "1 fat garlic clove, halved crosswise", "1 ripe and soft tomato, halved", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "Flaky sea salt", "Mayonnaise, as needed", "1 ripe but firm tomato, sliced", "Thinly sliced white onion", "4 slices cooked bacon (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toast the bread.
