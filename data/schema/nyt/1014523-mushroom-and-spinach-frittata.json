Drop a bit of egg into the pan and if it sizzles and cooks at once, the pan is ready. Pour in the egg mixture, scraping all of it in with a rubber spatula. Swirl the pan to distribute the eggs and filling evenly over the surface. Shake the pan gently, tilting it slightly with one hand while lifting up the edges of the frittata with the spatula in your other hand, to let the eggs run underneath during the first few minutes of cooking. Once a few layers of egg have cooked turn the heat down to low, cover (use a pizza pan if you don\u2019t have a lid that will fit your skillet), and cook 10 minutes, shaking the pan gently every once in a while. From time to time remove the lid and loosen the bottom of the omelet with a spatula, tilting the pan, so that the bottom doesn\u2019t burn. It will however turn golden. The eggs should be just about set though there will be a layer on the top that is not. "}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, heat the broiler. Uncover the pan and place under the broiler, not too close to the heat, for 1 to 2 minutes, until the top sets, watching very carefully to make sure the top doesn\u2019t burn (at most, it should brown very slightly and puff under the broiler). Remove from the heat, shake the pan to make sure the frittata isn\u2019t sticking and allow it to cool for at least 5 minutes and for up to 15. It can be a little runny in the middle if you like it that way. Loosen the edges with a spatula. Carefully slide from the pan onto a large round platter. Cut into wedges.
