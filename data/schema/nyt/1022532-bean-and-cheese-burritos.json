{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bean and Cheese Burritos", "description": "Mexican refried beans are a cinch to make at home on a weeknight thanks to some staple pantry items and a few basic fresh ingredients. Buttery canned pinto beans are perfect in this dish, breaking down into a creamy, silky mixture. (Black beans would also work great.) While the beans are often fried in lard or bacon drippings, this vegetarian version builds flavor with caramelized onion, bell pepper, garlic and smoked paprika instead. Pico de gallo adds a touch of tang to counter the rich beans. Pan-frying the wrapped burritos guarantees a golden, irresistibly crispy exterior and an interior that oozes with melted cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/03/dining/kc-bean-and-cheese-burritos/kc-bean-and-cheese-burritos-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 burritos", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "burrito, flour tortillas, pinto beans, sharp cheddar cheese, tortilla, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3604}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup safflower or canola oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion (from 1/2 medium onion)", "1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper (from 1/2 pepper)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 (15-ounce) cans pinto beans, 1/2 cup of bean liquid reserved and the rest drained", "1/2 cup store-bought or homemade pico de gallo or salsa", "1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika", "6 (9- to 10-inch) flour tortillas", "2 cups (8 ounces) shredded sharp Cheddar", "Sour cream and hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium.
