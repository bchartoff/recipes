{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "April Bloomfield's Clam Chowder", "description": "Fish chowder is the type of dish you might find in England at a country pub or in a fishing village. But the addition of Quahog clams and intensely flavorful Long Island sweet corn makes this particular chowder unmistakably American, and, with its hearty vegetables, bacon, potatoes and cream, a great dish for the Thanksgiving table. I usually like to start cooking early on Thanksgiving and potter around the kitchen, enjoying the warm steamy kitchen and the smells of chowder and pumpkins roasting. It reminds me of what I give thanks for every year: the warmth and comfort of family and friends, who gather around the pot with their bowls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "April Bloomfield"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/27/dining/27MEMBLOOMFIELD1/27MEMBLOOMFIELD1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, clams, corn", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 67}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 507, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "788 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2  onion, sliced", "3 cloves garlic, smashed", "3 to 4 bay leaves", "1 1/2 cups dry white wine", "30 large (15 to 20 pounds) quahog clams, scrubbed", "2 cups heavy cream", "2 cups whole milk", "1 cup diced Yukon Gold or russet potato", "1/4 cup olive oil, plus additional as needed for finishing", "2 slices smoked bacon, cut into 1/4-inch strips", "1 large carrot, cut into 3/4-inch pieces", "2 medium celery stalks, cut into 1/4-inch pieces", "1 large Spanish onion, cut into 3/4-inch pieces", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "2 dried pequin chilies, crumbled, or a pinch or red pepper flakes", "1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels, defrosted", "1/4 cup roughly chopped celery leaves", "Maldon salt or other flaky sea salt", "1/2 lemon", "1/4 cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam the clams: In a large stockpot, combine the olive oil, onion, garlic, bay leaves and wine.
