{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soba Noodles With Chicken and Snap Peas", "description": "A simple sesame-soy dressing coats chewy soba noodles, tender chicken and crisp sugar snap peas in this dish that's good at room temperature or cold. It\u2019s a great way to use leftover or store-bought rotisserie chicken, but also works well without. You can double up on the snap peas instead or fold in other vegetables, like grated carrots, shredded cabbage or thinly sliced bok choy. The quick daikon pickles add a bright tangy crunch, but you can skip them and still enjoy this one-bowl meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/dining/gk-soba-noodles-with-chicken-horizontal-2/gk-soba-noodles-with-chicken-horizontal-2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, noodles", "keywords": "chicken, daikon, sesame seeds, snap peas, soba noodles, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 559, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "761 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons rice vinegar", "3 tablespoons honey", "Kosher salt", "1 cup very thinly sliced peeled daikon radish", "8 ounces sugar snap peas, strings removed (3 cups)", "2 bundles soba noodles (8 to 9 ounces)", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons sesame oil", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "3 cups shredded cooked chicken", "Sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.
