{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Korean Fried Cauliflower", "description": "Long before the Cheesecake Factory made this dish popular in the United States, it was made at Yardbird in Hong Kong by the Canadian chef Matt Abergel. Food that is \u201cKorean-fried\u201d combines the thin, crisp crust of Japanese tempura with the fire of Korean gochujang, a spicy staple available in any Asian market. The Yardbird version also includes tempura mix and red yuzu kosho, a tart Japanese condiment made of red chiles, yuzu and salt. If those are out of reach, feel free to substitute your own favorite flavors \u2014 many versions of the sauce include a little ketchup \u2014 and use any tempura batter that you like. Just don\u2019t leave off the toasted sesame seeds; they add a nutty crunch at the very end.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/14/dining/kfc-recipe/kfc-recipe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 side-dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cauliflower, gochujang, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 177}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 772, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "164 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "193 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)", "1/2 cup sugar", "6 cloves garlic, pur\u00e9ed", "3 tablespoons red yuzu kosho", "1/4 cup mirin", "1 cup/140 grams tempura flour or tempura batter mix", "1 large egg yolk", "1 scant cup/150 grams potato starch", "1 cup plus 3 tablespoons/150 grams Japanese wheat flour or karaage ko", "Canola oil, as needed for deep-frying", "1 head cauliflower, cut into 2-inch florets", "Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish", "Lime wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the gochujang, sugar, garlic, yuzu kosho, mirin and 1 cup water.
