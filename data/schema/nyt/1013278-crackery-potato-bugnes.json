In another bowl, whisk the butter and salt together until smooth. Add the egg and whisk until the egg is beaten. (The mixture will look curdled, almost like egg-drop soup, but that\u2019s fine.) Add the dry ingredients and whisk to moisten as much of the mixture as you can. The dough will have lumps and clumps and a few flakes. Pour 3 tablespoons hot water over the dough and whisk (or mix with a rubber spatula) until the dough comes together. If it looks dry, add a little more water drop by drop (3 tablespoons is usually enough). You should have a soft, moist dough. Knead the dough a couple of times, divide it in half, pat it into a rectangular shape and wrap each half well. Chill the dough for at least 1 hour or for as long as overnight."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a baking sheet with wax paper.

Don\u2019t worry about rolling the dough into a perfectly even shape; you just want it to be very thin. If you flour it well enough, it will be easy to get that thinness."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a ruler and a pastry wheel (one with a zigzag edge is nice for this job) or pizza cutter, cut long strips 1 to 1\u00bd inches wide, then cut the strips at 2-inch intervals. (Again, size isn\u2019t really important and the shape is flexible \u2014 you can make long strips, triangles or squares.) Using the tip of a paring knife, cut a lengthwise slit about \u00be inch long in the center of each piece. Lift the pieces onto the baking sheet. When you\u2019ve filled the sheet, just cover the dough with another piece of wax paper and keep going. Roll and cut the other half of the dough and place these pieces on the baking sheet as well, separating the layers with wax paper. You should have about 60 bugnes. Chill for at least 1 hour or for as long as overnight. (When the dough is firm, you can pack the pieces airtight and freeze them for up to 2 months; they can be cooked without defrosting.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When you\u2019re ready to fry the bugnes, line a baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels. Pour 1 to 1\u00bd inches of olive oil into a deep saut\u00e9 pan or a Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot \u2014 it should measure 300 degrees on a deep-fat-frying or candy thermometer \u2014 drop a few pieces of dough into the pot. Don\u2019t crowd the pot; you want the oil to bubble around each piece of dough. Fry until the bugnes are lightly browned around the edges and golden in the center, about 2 minutes, then turn and brown the other side, about 1 minute more. Lift out of the oil with a slotted spoon, allowing the excess oil to drip back into the pot, and transfer them to the lined baking sheet. Pat off the excess oil, sprinkle with salt and continue frying the remaining pieces."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Serve the bugnes just warm or at room temperature, solo or with a little cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (or sour cream) and salmon roe or caviar."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013278-crackery-potato-bugnes"}
