{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry-Marsala Cake", "description": "Joe Trivelli, the head chef of the River Caf\u00e9 in London, has a recipe for an apple cake in his 2018 cookbook, \u201cThe Modern Italian Cook.\u201d It\u2019s simple to prepare but complex in flavor, because its batter includes vin santo and brown butter. Both the fruit and fortified wine are ingredients associated with Northern Italy. In Sicily, Marsala would be the spirit of choice; it has more depth than its counterpart thanks to a subtle savory quality, and is often used for macerating strawberries. It\u2019s a perfect pairing, improved upon when baked into this cake, especially when berries are in season.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Charlotte Druckman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/dining/23marsalarex3/merlin_153389490_6460e22c-7d27-43ee-93d7-09bf5b96b59c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, marsala, strawberries, superfine sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 290}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 407, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "93 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["9 tablespoons/125 grams unsalted butter, plus more for greasing", "1 1/4 pounds/565 grams fresh strawberries", "3/4 cup/150 grams superfine sugar, plus more as needed", "4 extra-large eggs, whites and yolks separated", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters sweet Marsala", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/150 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "Heaping 1/8 teaspoon fine salt", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting", "Freshly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brown the butter: Melt the 9 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling it occasionally.
