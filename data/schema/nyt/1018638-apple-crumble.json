{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Crumble", "description": "Apple crumble is one of those desserts all cooks should have in their back pockets. It\u2019s a no-fuss favorite that works as well for dessert with a big scoop of ice cream as it does for breakfast with some plain, whole-milk yogurt. This recipe starts with a hefty crumb mixture, studded with pecans and old-fashioned rolled oats. Plenty of butter and sugar ensure the crumb stays crisp after baking, creating a delightful textural contrast between topping and tender fruit. Using a mix of sweet and tart apples that soften at slightly different rates also keeps this recipe interesting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/dining/27COOKING-APPLE-CRUMB-ICECREAM1/27COOKING-APPLE-CRUMB-ICECREAM1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner", "keywords": "apple, oats, pecan, dessert, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 985}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 504, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "73 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "201 milligrams", "sugarContent": "45 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for buttering the pan", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cup/300 grams packed dark brown sugar, divided", "1 cup/80 grams old-fashioned rolled oats", "1 cup/113 grams pecans, chopped", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 1/2 pounds mixed apples, such as Granny Smith, Macintosh, and Pink Lady, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch wedges (about 8 medium apples)", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
