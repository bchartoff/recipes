{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Nopales en Chile Rojo", "description": "Learning the art of despining and cleaning nopales, edible cactus paddles, is practically a rite of passage for many who grow up in Mexican households. If nopales grow wild somewhere in the yard, they\u2019re gripped with tongs and sliced off the plant with a sharp knife. Once their prickly shield of armor is removed, they\u2019re cooked until they achieve their unique soft texture. (Groceries sell nopales despined, cleaned and ready to cook.) Often, charred nopales are then drowned in a guisado \u2014 here, it\u2019s a little spicy from chiles and saucy from tomatoes. The mild, slightly tangy nopales stained red from the chile guisado pair perfectly with fresh tortillas. This abuelita-approved dish is great with a side of pinto frijoles de la olla.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/16/dining/jr-grilled-nopales/merlin_188895633_0356d4b9-566f-4302-a3b8-a88ca230331d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "tacos, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "beefsteak tomatoes, guajillo chiles, nopales, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 96}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds nopales (6 to 8 large paddles)", "7 medium dried guajillo chiles, stemmed, seeded and rinsed", "2 medium beefsteak tomatoes, quartered", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "Salt", "1 tablespoon neutral-flavored oil, plus more if needed", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 cup pepitas, toasted", "1/4 cup cilantro leaves", "Sal de colima or flaky finishing salt, for serving", "12 corn tortillas, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Most markets sell nopales already despined and cleaned.
