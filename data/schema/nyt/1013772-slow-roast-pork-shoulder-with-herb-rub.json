Prepare a triple layer of aluminum foil large enough to comfortably enclose the pork. Put the rolled pork on the foil, skin/fatty side up.

For very tender meat that can be sliced, it should be 160 degrees and will probably take 10 hours. Check more often if needed. For a \u201cpulled pork\u201d consistency, the internal temperature should be 200 degrees and it will take about 12 hours."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rest the meat 20 minutes before unwrapping completely.
