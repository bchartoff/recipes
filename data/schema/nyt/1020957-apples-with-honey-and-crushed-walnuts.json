For me, that\u2019s charoset. Classically, it\u2019s an apple-walnut mixture (occasionally including a touch of cinnamon or dried fruit, or a combination) that ranges from chunky-relish to chunky-paste, and it\u2019s never been my favorite thing on the table. I\u2019ve always wanted it tangier, crunchier and, well, I wanted a salad. This is that salad. It\u2019s meant to be more acidic than sweet, but adjust with vinegar and honey as needed to suit your preference. A note: Nearly everyone who ate this salad said it was their favorite part of the whole meal, which bruised my matzo ball ego, but I thought you should know.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/dining/30Romanrex3-apples/merlin_170265360_e1d1216e-e198-463f-80bd-66ed3b881d29-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "apple, honey, walnut, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup raw walnut pieces or halves", "4 Honeycrisp or Pink Lady apples, or a comparable sweet-tart variety", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, plus more to taste", "Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons honey, plus more to taste", "Olive oil, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
