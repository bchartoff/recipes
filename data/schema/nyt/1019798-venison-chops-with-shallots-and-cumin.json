Try venison instead of the more common roasts. A rub of cumin and pepper gives these chops warmth, while bacon adds a whiff of smoke and some fat with which to baste the lean meat. This recipe avoids the usual tart-fruit component, so the spices have less competition. Instead, seared shallots go alongside. For venison, the rack is the easiest cut to prepare. and in a hot oven it is quickly done and cut into chops. The meat is hearty and succulent, with the merest hint of gaminess. Be sure to cook it only to medium rare or it will toughen. Since most venison that\u2019s available (unless you know a hunter) is ranch-raised in America or New Zealand and carries a hefty price tag, you do not want disappointment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/19/dining/19pairingrex1/merlin_147610527_2405dee1-ee79-4bd4-b56c-0c46e36155eb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "dry red wine, rack of venison, shallot, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 191, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "355 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces smoked bacon (4 thick strips)", "1 rack of venison, about 2 1/2 pounds, frenched", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Salt", "6 large shallots, quartered lengthwise", "1/2 cup beef or veal stock", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1 tablespoon grainy mustard", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "1 tablespoon soft unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a heavy skillet large enough to accommodate the rack of venison, fry the bacon.
