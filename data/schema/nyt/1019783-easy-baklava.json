Like traditional baklava, they are shatteringly crisp, gooey and sweet in all the right places, but much less work. Her original recipe calls for raw peanuts, but roasted work just fine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/05/dining/05books6/05books6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 50 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "pastries", "keywords": "dessert, peanut, phyllo, pistachio, walnut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 66}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 186, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "45 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/405 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters honey", "1 (3-inch) strip orange zest, cut with a vegetable peeler", "1 cardamom pod", "1/4 teaspoon rose water (optional)", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/90 milliliters neutral oil (such as grapeseed)", "8 ounces/225 grams raw or roasted peanuts", "8 ounces/225 grams raw pistachios", "8 ounces/225 grams raw walnuts", "1/2 cup/60 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 teaspoon rose water (optional)", "1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom (preferably freshly ground from the seeds of about 2 pods)", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 (1-pound/454-gram) package frozen phyllo dough, thawed completely"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the syrup: Combine sugar, 1 cup water, honey, orange zest and cardamom in a saucepan.
