{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Goat Cheese, Roasted Pepper, and Greens Sandwich", "description": "The title of this recipe was getting very long, so I left the last option \u2013 roasted artichoke hearts \u2013 out of it. I included them in my sandwich because I had some shriveling artichokes in my produce bin (along with the shriveling red pepper I used) and it didn\u2019t take very long to trim and roast them. But it\u2019s not a must; the peppers and goat cheese with the greens are what really stand out. I stir everything together and spread it on the bread. It\u2019s always a good idea to have a roasted pepper on hand for quick dinners like this.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/27/science/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "american, french, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 58}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 372, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "539 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 red pepper, roasted (you\u2019ll  need only half of it for 1 sandwich)", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 trimmed artichoke heart, quartered if small, sliced about 1/2 inch thick if large and tossed with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and salt and pepper to taste (optional)", "1 tablespoon chopped blanched greens, such as beet greens, chard, or spinach", "1 ounce goat cheese (about 1/4 cup)", "2 slices whole-grain country bread", "1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 clove garlic (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dice roasted red pepper  small  and toss with salt, pepper and a teaspoon of olive oil.
