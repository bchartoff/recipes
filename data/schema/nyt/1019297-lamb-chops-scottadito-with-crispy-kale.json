{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Chops Scottadito With Crispy Kale", "description": "The word scottadito means burned fingers in Italian; these lamb chops are best eaten with one's fingers soon after they come off the grill. The recipe comes from\u00a0Rachael Ray, who serves these at her homes in upstate New York and Manhattan. The lamb chops are best if they marinate for several hours, but turn out just fine with an hour or two under the anchovy and garlic paste. Ms. Ray's method for preparing kale produces crispy leaves; key elements are the lightest spray of oil, and baking racks to get them really crisp. They need to be made in batches, but a hot oven makes the job quick, and they can also be done a little bit ahead of time and served at room temperature. Don\u2019t skip grilling the lemon: the slightly charred, acidic flavor adds an essential layer.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/dining/09rayrex1/09rayrex1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, barbecues", "keywords": "kale, lamb chops, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 63}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 lamb rib chops", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper", "6 anchovy fillets", "1/4 cup capers in brine, drained", "2 lemons, zested and cut in half", "4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed", "24 fresh sage leaves, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 large bunch lacinato or Tuscan kale, stems removed and leaves left whole", "Grapeseed or other oil suitable for high heat, for preparing the grill"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a mallet, pound each rib chop to 1/4-inch thickness.

After flipping the lamb to cook on the second side, place the lemon halves on the grill and char until caramelized and browned, about 2 to 4 minutes.
