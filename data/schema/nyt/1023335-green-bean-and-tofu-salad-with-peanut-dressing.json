{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Bean and Tofu Salad With Peanut Dressing", "description": "Inspired by the combination of peanut sauce with vegetables in southeast Asia, found in dishes such as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021341-gado-gado\">gado gado</a> in Indonesia and summer rolls in Vietnam, this streamlined salad would work just as well as a vegetarian main dish to eat with rice or noodles. The green beans are cooked for only a short while so that they stay crunchy. If you prefer floppy beans, you can cook them longer. And if you want something more refreshing and don\u2019t want to turn on the stove, you can skip the beans altogether and use cut-up cucumbers and tomatoes instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/GK-Green-Bean-Salad-With-Peanut-Dressing-15SALADREX/merlin_209704521_6c566886-80f4-4394-859e-bcf573432b94-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "green beans, hoisin sauce, peanut butter, tofu, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 475}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter", "2 tablespoons hoisin sauce", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for sprinkling", "12 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch lengths", "1 (14-ounce) box extra-firm tofu, drained and cut into 1-inch cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil.
