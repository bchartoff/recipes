You eat it on a foam plate with a plastic fork or chopsticks. It\u2019s a mound of chicken nearly afloat in a bath of dark, spicy sauce that contains star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, chile, garlic, cilantro, a few mystery ingredients and potatoes.  Those of you who live in or visit New York should eat this dish whenever you can, but it can absolutely be prepared at home. It\u2019s not precisely a simple recipe. But it\u2019s an excellent project one. And you can improve on the ingredients. At Spicy Village, both MSG and Budweiser are ingredients. We managed to make do without the MSG and used Negra Modelo beer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/17/magazine/17eat/mag-17Eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "at least 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, project", "keywords": "beer, chicken legs, chicken thighs, sichuan peppercorns, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 404}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken \nthighs and legs", "2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste", "2 teaspoons, plus 1 tablespoon black \npepper, plus more to taste", "1 12-ounce beer", "1 pound new potatoes", "1 to 2 quarts vegetable oil", "2 tablespoons sliced garlic", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds", "2 teaspoons fennel seeds", "1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, roughly chopped", "1 star anise, left whole", "2 dried chiles, minced", "1 1/2 tablespoons Sichuan hot bean sauce", "2 tablespoons dark rice wine (preferably Fujian Cooking Wine)", "3 to 4 cups chicken stock or water", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "Cilantro, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "With a cleaver, chop the chicken into 2-inch pieces, and toss with 2 teaspoons salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper.
