I\u2019m sure of that. I\u2019m less sure, because I can\u2019t find it online, that the book gives a variation that calls for rubbing the meat with fennel and coriander seeds, among other spices. I wanted to try some version of that on a chicken and came up with the idea of grafting those seasonings, as I remembered them, onto a classic Marcella Hazan recipe for chicken alla diavola. Hazan has you <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/dining/100000003069750/cooking-techniques-spatchcocking.html\">butterfly the chicken</a> and rub it with cracked black pepper before grilling or broiling it. Just by faking and misremembering, I stumbled on a weeknight dinner that\u2019s faster than roast chicken and fragrant with mysteriously harmonious spices. It may not be the devil\u2019s chicken, but it could be the work of one of his minor demons.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pete Wells"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/13/dining/13COOKING-BUTTERFLIED-CHICKEN2/13COOKING-BUTTERFLIED-CHICKEN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, times classics", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 91}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 562, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "560 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 chicken, around 3 pounds", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 teaspoons fennel seed", "1 teaspoon coriander seed", "1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns", "1/4 teaspoon cumin seed", "2 teaspoons coarse sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon hot paprika or piment\u00f3n", "Lemon halves or fat wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Light a grill or set your broiler on high and give it a 15-minute head start."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/dining/100000003069750/cooking-techniques-spatchcocking.html\">Butterfly (or spatchcock) the chicken</a>: Cut out the chicken\u2019s backbone with poultry shears, a cleaver or a sharp, heavy chef\u2019s knife (or ask a butcher to do this).
