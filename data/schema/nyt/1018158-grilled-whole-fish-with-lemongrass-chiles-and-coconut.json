{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Whole Fish With Lemongrass, Chiles and Coconut", "description": "Spicy, herbal and a little sweet from the coconut milk, these grilled whole fish are perfumed with lemongrass and spiked with tiny, potent Thai chiles. I like dorade here, but you can use any small whole fish (1 pound or so). Have your fishmonger clean them but leave in the bones. They help keep the fish moist on the grill and add great flavor. You can also roast the fish instead of grilling; place them on a rimmed baking sheet and roast at 425 degrees until the fish is cooked through, usually 10 to 15 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/03/multimedia/clark-grilled-dorade/clark-grilled-dorade-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "cilantro, coconut milk, dorade, fish sauce, lemongrass, mint, Thai chile, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 147}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 615, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "86 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "495 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (1-pound) whole dorade, branzino or trout, cleaned", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, more as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "1 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil, softened or melted", "3 limes", "2 small shallots, peeled", "1 bunch cilantro, leaves and stems separated (about 2 cups leaves)", "2 small stalks lemongrass, halved lengthwise and cut into 3-inch pieces", "1 cup mint leaves, more for garnish", "1 Thai chile or 1 to 2 serrano chiles, seeded and coarsely chopped", "2 small garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced", "1/4 teaspoon Asian fish sauce, more to taste", "1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk", "1 tablespoon safflower or grapeseed oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season cavities and outside of fish with salt and pepper.
