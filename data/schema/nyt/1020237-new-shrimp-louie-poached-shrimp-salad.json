From there, you can add any number of raw or lightly blanched vegetables, like shaved radish, sliced avocado or blanched green beans. To make things easy and efficient, the shrimp, eggs and green beans can all be cooked in the same pot of boiling water, so it\u2019s not much of a fuss.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/dining/20Romanrex/merlin_154781400_28fde81b-638c-4968-a091-e2821f68ef96-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, salads and dressings, seafood", "keywords": "avocado, egg, green beans, lettuce, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 317}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "8 ounces green beans, tails trimmed", "1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, shell on, deveined if you like", "4 large eggs", "1 small shallot, sliced", "2 tablespoons fresh tarragon leaves, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 large head romaine lettuce or 3 heads Little Gem lettuce, torn or cut into large pieces", "1 medium watermelon radish or 3 regular radishes\u00a0(or a mix of both), thinly sliced", "1 avocado, thinly sliced", "Olive oil, for serving", "1 cup <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020051-zuni-cafes-small-batch-aioli\">aioli</a> or mayonnaise, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
