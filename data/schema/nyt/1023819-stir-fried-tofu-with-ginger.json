{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Tofu With Ginger", "description": "Tofu and ginger share equal billing in this easy, economical weeknight stir-fry. The ginger is sliced into fine slivers and added towards the end of cooking so that it retains a fresh, slightly raw bite, while also adding texture to the dish. The bouncy and juicy texture of the tofu is achieved by lightly dusting the tofu with cornstarch which absorbs excess moisture, helps the tofu stay intact and ensures that the sauce clings to every surface. To make sure that your tofu doesn\u2019t stick to the pan use a very well-seasoned wok or cast-iron pan and heat it well, until you can see smoke rising from the surface of the pan. (Or use a non-stick pan, and there\u2019s no need to heat until smoking.) If you do find a lot of the tofu stuck to the pan after Step 3, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water to deglaze it before adding the ginger, scallions and sauce.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/13/multimedia/hm-tofu-ginger-stir-fry-bhjf/hm-tofu-ginger-stir-fry-bhjf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, beans, main course", "keywords": "chile crisp, chile oil, cornstarch, extra-firm tofu, five spice powder, fresh ginger, scallion, shaoxing, soy sauce, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 379}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (14-ounce) packages extra firm tofu, drained", "4 tablespoons soy sauce\u00a0", "2 tablespoons cornstarch\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon five spice powder\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon white or black pepper\u00a0", "Neutral oil (such as canola or sunflower)\u00a0", "1 bunch scallions (about 8 stems), trimmed, white and green parts separated and cut into 2-inch segments", "3-inch piece ginger (about 3 ounces), peeled and finely julienned (\u00bd packed cup julienned ginger)", "Toasted white sesame seeds, to serve", "Rice, to serve", "2 tablespoons light soy sauce", "2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine or dry sherry", "2 teaspoons chile oil or crisp\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the tofu.
