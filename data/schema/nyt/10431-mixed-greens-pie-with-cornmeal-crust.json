Grease a 10-inch straight-sided skillet or baking pan with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. In a deep-sided saut\u00e9 pan at least 12 inches wide, heat 1/3 cup olive oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until they have softened but not colored, about 10 minutes. Add as many of the greens as can fit in the pot, along with 1 teaspoon salt. Stir and cover until the greens have wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the remaining greens, stir, and cover until they have wilted, another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the scallions, dill and parsley.

Whisk in the cornmeal and 1 teaspoon salt. Continue stirring as the mixture thickens into an almost unstirrable paste. Remove from the heat. With lightly floured fingers, press half of the mixture into a thin layer across the bottom of the prepared pan. Top with the greens and cheese filling, spreading each evenly to the edges. Stir about 1/2 cup water into the remaining cornmeal to make a milkshake-thick batter (there will be a few lumps). Pour the thinned batter across the filling (some greens will poke through). Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of olive oil across the top of the pie. Bake until firm and golden brown around the edges, about 1 hour."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Serve warm or at room temperature, with Greek yogurt on the side."}]}
