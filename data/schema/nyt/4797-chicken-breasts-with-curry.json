{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Breasts With Curry", "description": "Here, standard weeknight chicken breasts are transformed into a dish that's fragrant and spicy. It's very easy to prepare: just make a quick stew of butter, onions, celery, garlic, apple, tomatoes and curry powder. Blend that together in a food processor until it forms a thick sauce, then combine with chicken breasts that have been lightly browned. Simmer until heated through, and enjoy with a snowy pile of rice. It beats takeout curry by a mile.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/27/dining/27COOKING-CURRY-CHICKEN-BREASTS2/27COOKING-CURRY-CHICKEN-BREASTS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "apple, chicken breast, coriander, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 423}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 322, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "731 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons butter", "1/2 cup chopped onions", "2 teaspoons chopped garlic", "1 apple, cored and finely cubed, about 1 cup", "1/2 cup finely chopped celery", "2 tablespoons curry powder", "1/2 cup canned crushed tomatoes", "3/4 cup chicken broth, more as needed", "1 bay leaf", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves, about 1 1/4 pounds total", "4 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a saucepan.
