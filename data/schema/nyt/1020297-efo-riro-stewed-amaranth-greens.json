It is rich enough that the starches it accompanies \u2014 various pounded starches called fufu, fluffy steamed rice, boiled plantains or yams, to name a few \u2014 can come very much unadorned. While the leafy, hearty amaranth greens form the traditional base, mature spinach is a great substitute, and, though rare in Nigerian cuisine, collards or kale can also be used. It is crucial to blanch fresh greens and squeeze out as much liquid as possible before adding to the obe ata base of pur\u00e9ed tomatoes, peppers and onions. If using frozen greens, defrost ahead of time and repeat the squeezing process. The last thing you want to do is dilute all those incredible flavors you\u2019ve spent time building.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/24Nigerianrex5/merlin_156460131_f61465f7-598a-45ac-8df1-63eac1cc19f8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "amaranth greens, red palm oil, smoked mackerel, turmeric, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 19}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes with their juices", "1 medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and roughly chopped", "1/2 medium red onion, peeled and roughly chopped", "4 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "1 red habanero chile, stemmed", "2 tablespoons canola or other neutral oil", "Kosher salt", "3 pounds fresh amaranth greens (also known as tete or callaloo) or mature spinach, or 2 pounds frozen whole-leaf spinach, thawed", "2 tablespoons canola\u00a0or other neutral oil", "1 medium onion, peeled and minced", "1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped", "1 tablespoon dried crayfish or 2 tablespoons tiny dried shrimp", "1 tablespoon fermented locust beans (or fermented black beans), rinsed, soaked in warm water for 10 minutes to rehydrate, then drained", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 tablespoon red palm oil", "3 smoked mackerel or smoked white fish\u00a0fillets\u00a0(about 3 ounces each), skin and bones removed and fillets flaked (about 1 1/2 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all the obe ata ingredients except the canola oil in a blender and pur\u00e9e on high until smooth, working in batches if needed.
