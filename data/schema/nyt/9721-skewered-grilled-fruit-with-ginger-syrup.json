The sauce is a simple sugar syrup -- half sugar, half water, boiled together until the sugar melts -- and is infused with a lot of ginger. You could use other flavors instead (mint, lemon verbena, thyme, even chili), but ginger seems perfect to me.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/11/dining/video-grilledfruit/video-grilledfruit-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "banana, pineapple, starfruit, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 10}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "75 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "4 milligrams", "sugarContent": "56 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup sugar", "1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh ginger (don't bother to peel it)", "4 unpeeled bananas (not overripe)", "1 small pineapple", "1 starfruit (carambola), optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a gas or charcoal fire; it should be quite hot, with the rack positioned 4 to 6 inches from the source of heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the sugar, fresh ginger and 1/2 cup of water in a small saucepan over medium heat.
