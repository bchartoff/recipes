{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cod and Clams in Coconut Nage", "description": "This dish needs only 20 minutes of attention at the stove. The coconut nage delivers a whisper of sweetness, ginger-chile heat and a splash of lime, and the broth is light enough to suit a summer dinner with plenty of chilled wine. I paired it with the best of M\u00e2connais, wines that express citrus and minerals balanced by a touch of grapy richness. I served saut\u00e9ed sugar snap peas alongside, on separate plates.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/04/dining/04PAIR_SPAN/04PAIR_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "clams, coconut milk, cod, dairy-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 473, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "974 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds fresh skinless cod fillets, in 6 pieces", "3 tablespoons lime juice", "Salt and ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons grapeseed oil", "6 cloves garlic, slivered", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and slivered", "1 1/2 cups thinly sliced fennel bulb", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "18 littleneck clams, scrubbed", "1 14-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk, stirred", "3 cups steamed jasmine rice", "12 mint leaves, slivered"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place cod on a platter, pour 2 tablespoons lime juice over it and season with salt and pepper.
