They are ready for action the minute the fragrances of ginger, coriander and lemon grass waft from the kitchen.This recipe follows the template for many Thai dishes: it starts with a curry paste that is heated and becomes the foundation for a stir-fry. The dish does require some shopping, though most of the ingredients have become mainstream. Asparagus cues the season.
