{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Polenta With Wild Mushrooms and Marinara Sauce", "description": "Years ago, I abandoned the traditional stir-until-you-get-a-blister-on-the-inside-of-your-thumb method for making polenta and became a convert to the easy oven-baked version. But then I began working with polenta freshly milled from heirloom varieties of corn, and went back to the top-of-the-stove method because the results were exceptionally creamy and fragrant.\n\nThis was at the urging of Kay Rentschler, who is the creative director of the Anson Mills website and writes its recipes. She is very specific about the best way to cook the mill\u2019s products, so I followed her instructions for polenta, which are shared here. The flavor of the corn is heavenly, and once it begins to thicken, you don\u2019t have to stir continuously, so it is not tedious to make.\n\nYou could serve polenta as a side, but I like to show it off and serve it as a main dish (a boon for those who now eschew pasta). It\u2019s a wonderful vehicle for any number of toppings, but my favorite is a simple tomato sauce embellished with pan-cooked mushrooms, preferably meaty, flavorful varieties like oysters or maitakes. If you want to be extravagant, throw a few chanterelles into the mix.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/24/science/recipehealthmushrooms/recipehealthmushrooms-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 144}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 416, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "649 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup fine yellow or white polenta", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, more to taste", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan, more to taste and for garnish", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound wild mushrooms, like oysters or maitakes, cleaned and torn into small pieces if large", "2 shallots, minced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme", "1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary or sage", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley", "1 cup Simple Marinara Sauce (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017178-simple-marinara-sauce\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the polenta, place it and 3 1/2 cups water in a heavy 2 1/2- or 3-quart saucepan with a lid, and stir to combine.
