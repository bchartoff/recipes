While many dairy-free pasta recipes look to pur\u00e9ed, soaked cashews for their creaminess, this one cuts corners by using store-bought cashew butter. A spoonful of miso adds depth, and tangy nutritional yeast adds umami. Toasting the peppercorns boosts their flavor and softens them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/17/dining/aw-vegan-cacio-e-pepe/aw-vegan-cacio-e-pepe-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "cashew butter, lemon, nutritional yeast, peppercorns, spaghetti, white miso, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 817}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1/3 cup nutritional yeast", "1/4 cup cashew butter", "2 tablespoons white miso paste", "1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns", "16 ounces dried spaghetti", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1/2 lemon, squeezed as needed (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high.
