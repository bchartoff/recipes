{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken With Cumin, Paprika and Mint", "description": "Chicken shawarma, a rotisserie favorite heady with spice and flavor, is usually cooked on a spit, then shaved into sandwiches and salads. But it also belongs on a bed of rice, cooked in a pan for a filling family meal that\u2019s easy to return to again and again. White rice does a fine job rounding out this meal, and cooks quickly. But, if brown rice is more your speed, look for the sprouted short-grain variety, which cooks faster than regular brown rice and reaches al dente just as the chicken begins to split into tender morsels. (To cook the rice even faster, soak it while you marinate the chicken.)\u00a0Cooking this on the stove yields crisp rice bits along the bottom of the pan, especially nice against the tender, flavorful chicken. Since even the best shawarma is only as good as its bright flavors, be generous with mint, parsley, yogurt and lime: the more, the better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/dining/sc-chicken-shawarma/sc-chicken-with-orzo-dill-and-feta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thighs, cinnamon stick, raisin, white rice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 615}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 887, "unsaturatedFatContent": "34 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "860 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 lemons, juiced", "1/3 cup olive oil", "6 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "2 teaspoons ground paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 4)", "1 yellow onion, peeled and chopped", "1 1/2 cups long-grain white or sprouted short-grain brown rice", "2 3/4 cups boiling water", "1 cinnamon stick", "1/2 cup raisins", "1/2 cup chopped fresh mint, for serving", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, for serving", "Plain yogurt, for serving", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the lemon juice, 1/4 cup of the olive oil, the garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, cumin, paprika and turmeric in a large resealable plastic bag along with the chicken pieces.
