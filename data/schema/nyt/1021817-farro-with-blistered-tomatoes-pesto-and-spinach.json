{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro With Blistered Tomatoes, Pesto and Spinach", "description": "Here is an Italian-inspired recipe that uses store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2653-basic-pesto\">homemade pesto</a> to season farro, which is then tossed with fresh spinach, roasted tomatoes, red onions and mozzarella for a complete vegetarian meal. Make it with fresh-from-the-market cherry tomatoes when they\u2019re in season, but during the rest of the year, use grape tomatoes, as they tend to be more flavorful than cherry during the colder months. If you\u2019d like, substitute arugula, or cooked broccoli rabe or kale, for the spinach. It tastes delicious warm or cold the next day \u2014 and topping it with shrimp, chicken or scallops can make it feel new again. Before reheating, add a bit more spinach, drizzle it with a little olive oil and give it a good stir.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/25/dining/yf-farro-with-blistered-tomatoes/merlin_181550163_266e538c-4dc6-4ffe-a524-60f9d0ba49e8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, weeknight, grains and rice, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, farro, grape tomato, make-ahead, pesto, spinach, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2384}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup farro, rinsed", "2 pints cherry or grape tomatoes", "1 small red onion, peeled, quartered and cut into 1-inch wedges", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for the farro", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/4 cup store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2653-basic-pesto?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=1\">homemade pesto</a>, plus more to taste", "1 lemon, zested (about 1 tablespoon) and juiced (about 2 tablespoons)", "2 packed cups baby spinach", "1 (4-ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, torn into chunks, or 1/2 cup ricotta salata, crumbled (optional)", "1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley or basil leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
