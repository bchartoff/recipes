{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Endive Tarte Tatin With Burrata", "description": "A savory take on the classic apple tarte Tatin, this version features unexpected bitter endive, which mellows and sweetens as it cooks. The tart slices are served topped with milky burrata to complement the caramelized endive and buttery pastry, but they\u2019re equally as lovely without it. The tart can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature, making it a perfect make-ahead entree or side for entertaining.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/16/dining/kc-endive-tarte-tatin-with-burrata/merlin_197633073_53b98e13-c401-4e32-8bc3-a44a91c2e15b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "burrata, endive, puff pastry, fall, winter, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 494}, "recipeIngredient": ["All-purpose flour, for surfaces", "1 (14-ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons turbinado sugar or granulated sugar", "6 large endive (1 1/2 pounds), halved lengthwise through the core", "Salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/4 cup chopped chives, plus more for garnish", "2 (8-ounce) balls burrata cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
