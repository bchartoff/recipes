{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spam Macaroni and Cheese", "description": "This decadent yet simple recipe pairs creamy macaroni and cheese with crispy, salty-sweet diced Spam for a dish that bridges Puerto Rico and the South. It\u2019s much quicker than most homemade macaroni and cheese recipes (which often require making a roux and cream sauce), without sacrificing texture or flavor. It is also incredibly adaptable, because it will work with most cheeses. If you have the time and the will, sprinkle the finished macaroni with extra cheese and bake under a low broil for 5 to 10 minutes until toasted. During tough times, a box of instant mac and cheese and a can of Spam will also yield delicious results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/dining/26resiliencerex1/merlin_177593415_6b0acdb5-2f59-418e-921b-01165996e76e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, meat, noodles, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cheddar, cheese, macaroni, milk, monterey jack cheese", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (12-ounce) can Spam, cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "Kosher salt", "1 pound dried macaroni", "3 cups whole milk", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "4 1/2 to 5 cups shredded cheese (about 20 to 24 ounces), preferably a combination of Monterey Jack and sharp yellow Cheddar", "1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil over high heat in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high, then add Spam and fry for about 10 minutes, stirring often, until the meat is evenly browned and crispy.
