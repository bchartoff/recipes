{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thai-Inspired Coconut Chicken Breasts With Vegetables", "description": "This fast but fabulous chicken dish pairs Thai-inspired flavors with French technique. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts have weeknight appeal, largely because they cook so quickly, but that also means they can dry out and become tough if you\u2019re not careful. Here, the chicken is gently cooked for about 10 minutes, then simmered in a ginger-scented coconut sauce studded with green beans and corn, resulting in tender and juicy chicken. Slicing the breasts before serving allows the sauce to coat each piece, adding more moisture and flavor. If you want more heat, sprinkle thinly sliced serrano chile over the top before serving. The best part is the entire meal comes together in about a half-hour: If you\u2019re quick, you can get all the vegetable prep done while the chicken cooks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/dining/ss-thai-chicken/ss-thai-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, grains and rice, poultry, vegetables", "keywords": "chicken, chicken cutlet, cilantro, ginger, green beans, serrano chili, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 674}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each)", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as vegetable, canola or grapeseed oil", "1 large shallot, peeled and thinly sliced into rings", "1 large or 2 small garlic cloves, finely grated", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, finely grated (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)", "1 small serrano chile or jalape\u00f1o, finely chopped, or more to taste", "1/2 cup chicken stock", "1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened, full-fat coconut milk", "6 ounces green beans, trimmed and halved crosswise", "1 ear fresh corn, kernels removed, or 1 cup frozen corn kernels", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish", "2 limes (1 zested and juiced; 1 cut into wedges)", "Fish sauce (optional)", "Jasmine rice, for serving", "16 Sungold or other cherry tomatoes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt.
