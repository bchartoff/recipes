{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Hot Fudge Sundae", "description": "There is a reason a hot fudge sundae is such an enduring classic: That combination of warm, rich chocolate fudge mixing with frozen ice cream and melting it slightly is absolutely irresistible. Of course, if  you have homemade fudge sauce and homemade ice cream, it gets even better. Vanilla ice cream is the standard here, but feel free to use your favorite flavor, or a combination of flavors. And if you like nuts, by all means use them here. The added crunch is marvelous against all the rich creaminess.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/12/dining/00Icecream11/00Icecream11-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dessert, dutch-processed cocoa powder, heavy cream, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 24}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 756, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "81 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "sodiumContent": "215 milligrams", "sugarContent": "74 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup packed light brown sugar", "1/3 cup light corn syrup or honey", "3 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed", "7 ounces finely chopped bittersweet chocolate", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 tablespoon brandy or rum", "1 cup chilled heavy cream", "1 tablespoon superfine sugar, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 pints your favorite flavor ice cream", "Chopped toasted nuts, such as almonds, peanuts, or pecans (optional)", "Cherries, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream, sugar, corn syrup or honey, cocoa, and salt to a simmer, whisking until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "\u00a0Stir in the chocolate and let cook until the chocolate melts.
