{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Japanese Milk Bread", "description": "When panko, Japanese bread crumbs, first appeared here, American cooks leaped to embrace their spiky crunch. (The first article about it in the New York Times appeared in 1998.) But how could breadcrumbs arrive from Japan, a land without bread?  The answer is here, in the lofty, feathery white bread that is a staple at bakeries in Asia \u2014 and in Asian bakery chains like Fay Da and Paris Baguette. (Panko is often made from the heels of the loaf, called the \u201cears\u201d in Japanese.)  Milk bread was developed in Japan in the 20th century, using tangzhong, a warm flour-and-water paste traditionally used in China to make buns with a soft, springy texture and tiny air bubbles. <br /><br />Surprisingly, milk bread with an incomparable crumb and buttery taste is a snap to make at home, using supermarket ingredients.  Once the tanzhong is cooked and cooled \u2014 a matter of 10 minutes at the stove \u2014 you have an easy and immensely rewarding dough.  It can be shaped into coils or round rolls, like pull-aparts, instead of loaves, or you can paint it with cinnamon sugar or dulce de leche or strawberry jam when you roll it out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/23/dining/23WHITE2/23WHITE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 loaf", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, bread, milk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 679}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 279, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "217 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/45 grams bread flour", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "2 1/2 cups/325 grams bread flour", "1/4 cup/60 grams sugar", "2 teaspoons/7 grams active dry yeast (1 packet)", "1 teaspoon/4 grams salt", "1 egg", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters warm whole milk, plus extra for brushing on the unbaked loaf", "4 tablespoons/60 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces and softened at room temperature, plus extra for buttering bowls and pan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the starter: In a small heavy pot, whisk flour, milk and 1/2 cup water (120 milliliters) together until smooth.
