{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Corn, Zucchini And Tomatoes", "description": "The two things I love most about this dish of summer vegetables and pasta are the crunch of the corn against the tenderness of the pasta and the fact that I cannot seem to settle on a combination of flavorings that I think is best. Chile powder, a little bit of cayenne, perhaps some cilantro are all excellent choices. But with pasta this seems too heretical even for a culinary atheist like me, so I usually go in a tamer direction: a suspicion of garlic with some fresh tarragon or basil. It is flexible not only in its flavorings but in its ingredients. You can use onions, garlic or shallots, singly or in combination; add string beans (or even fresh limas) to the mix; substitute eggplant for the zucchini. Think of it as a delicious m\u00e9lange of whatever is on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/14/dining/14COOKING_PASTITOMATOES1/14COOKING_PASTITOMATOES1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, pastas", "keywords": "corn, pasta, zucchini, main course, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 509}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 615, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "101 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "661 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and pepper", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or 2 tablespoons oil and 1 tablespoon butter", "1 cup corn kernels (from 2 or 3 ears)", "1 cup diced zucchini or summer squash (from 2 or 3 small vegetables)", "1 medium onion or 3 or 4 shallots, diced", "1/4 teaspoon minced garlic, optional", "1 or 2 sprigs tarragon", "4 plum or 2 large tomatoes, diced", "1 pound cut pasta, like penne"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a large pot of water to boil and salt it.
