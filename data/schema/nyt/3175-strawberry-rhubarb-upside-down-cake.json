{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry-Rhubarb Upside-Down Cake", "description": "This humble dessert would never win a beauty contest when pitted against a towering layer cake swirled with frosting, but what it lacks in looks, it makes up in flavor and simplicity of preparation. The cake itself is light yet moist and soaks up the juice released by the strawberries and rhubarb while baking. Sliced almonds add a gentle crunch. It can be a bit tricky to unmold, so don't forget to line the pan with parchment and grease it generously with butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/18/dining/18COOKING-STRBRYRHUBARBCAKE1/18COOKING-STRAWBERRYRHUBARBCAKE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, flour, rhubarb, strawberries, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 415}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 372, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "214 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus 1 to 2 teaspoons for greasing the pan", "3/4 cup light-brown sugar", "1/3 cup sliced almonds", "1 pint strawberries (about 12 ounces), stemmed, hulled and halved", "3 cups rhubarb, trimmed, cut across into 1/4-inch-thick slices, blanched for 2 minutes and drained well", "1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened", "1 cup sugar", "2 eggs", "1/2 cup milk", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
