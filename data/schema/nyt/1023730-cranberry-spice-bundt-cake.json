{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry Spice Bundt Cake", "description": "This tall and tender Bundt cake pulls off the trick of being cozy and zingy at the same time. It gets its soft crumb from yogurt (although you could use sour cream or buttermilk) and its pop from puckery fresh cranberries and a mix of cardamom, coriander and ginger. It\u2019s festive with a cranberry icing and classic with a dusting of powdered sugar. And it\u2019s a cake that can go through the seasons \u2014 think about swapping the cranberries for dried fruit in the winter and berries in the summer. It\u2019s great with blueberries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/14/multimedia/09CAKESREX2-cranberry-bundt-1-6a2e/12CAKES-REX2-cranberry-bundt-1-6a2e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "Bundt cake, cardamom, cranberry, ground coriander, make-ahead, yogurt, christmas, thanksgiving, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1001}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut into chunks (plus more for the pan if not using nonstick baker\u2019s spray)", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour (plus more for the pan if not using nonstick baker\u2019s spray)", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/4 teaspoons ground cardamom", "3/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "Finely grated zest of 1 orange or 2 small tangerines", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters neutral oil", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1 cup/235 grams plain Greek yogurt, at room temperature and drained of excess liquid, if necessary", "2 cups/200 grams fresh or frozen (unthawed) cranberries, coarsely chopped", "2 1/4 cups/275 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (maybe a bit more) cranberry or pomegranate juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven and heat it to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Butter a large (12- to 13-cup) Bundt pan, dust the interior with flour and tap out the excess, or coat the pan with nonstick baker\u2019s spray."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda and then whisk in the cardamom, coriander and ginger; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large mixing bowl that will work with an electric mixer.
