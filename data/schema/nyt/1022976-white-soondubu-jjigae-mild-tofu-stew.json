{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Soondubu Jjigae (Mild Tofu Stew)", "description": "This Korean stew features velvety silken tofu in a clear, savory broth that allows the nutty flavor of the tofu to shine. Dried kelp, radishes and shiitake mushrooms build the base of the soothing soup: Radishes impart sweetness, while the kelp and mushrooms add earthy notes. Sesame seeds give each spoonful an extra toasty flavor and crunch. Traditionally, the stew is finished with eggs that have been gently poached, with runny yolks that enrich the broth. If desired, crack four eggs into the stew once the tofu is warmed through and let them simmer gently for three minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/10/dining/kc-white-soondubu-jjigae/merlin_201238995_1f920e65-b580-418e-94e7-2cfb6e2ad184-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "weekday, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "kelp, shiitake, tofu, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 241}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (6-inch) square dried kelp (also labeled as dashima or kombu)", "8 ounces Korean radish or daikon, peeled and sliced \u00bc-inch thick, then cut into 1-inch pieces (2 cups)", "3 dried shiitake mushrooms", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "4 scallions, thinly sliced", "Salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds", "1 teaspoon minced ginger", "1 large zucchini (8 ounces), halved lengthwise and sliced into \u00bc-inch-thick half-moons (2 cups)", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1 1/2 pounds silken tofu, broken into large pieces with a spoon", "1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "Steamed rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, combine kelp, radish, dried shiitakes and 5 cups of water, and bring to a simmer over high heat.
