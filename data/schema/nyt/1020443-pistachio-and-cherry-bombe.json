Don\u2019t be afraid to mix the biscotti dough by hand and play around when you are shaping it into your bowl. It won\u2019t look perfect, but the bombe will be pristine. Confectioners\u2019 sugar, cherries and grated pistachios are your allies to make this dish scream of delight. This bombe is frivolity at its finest, so don\u2019t take the process of making it too seriously.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clare de Boer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/29/dining/Clare-de-Boer-Bomb/merlin_158698995_49437d7a-57bb-45da-82e1-837375b1ec9f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "16 to 20 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, ice creams and sorbets, project", "keywords": "cherries, honey, pistachio, vanilla ice cream, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 144}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 cups/750 grams shelled, raw unsalted pistachios", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "3 lemons, zested (about 2 1/2 tablespoons)", "2 tablespoons honey", "6 egg whites", "1/2 pound sweet cherries, pitted (about 1 1/2 cups)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "3 1/2 pints vanilla ice cream, softened", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for serving", "Shelled, raw unsalted pistachios, for garnish", "Cherries, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, grind the pistachios and granulated sugar into a fine meal."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Transfer pistachio meal to a medium bowl; add the zest, honey and egg whites and combine the ingredients using your hands until fully integrated."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, pressing evenly until about 1/3-inch thick, and bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes.
