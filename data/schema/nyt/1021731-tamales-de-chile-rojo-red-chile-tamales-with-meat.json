{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tamales de Chile Rojo (Red Chile Tamales With Meat)", "description": "Tamales are often served with complementing salsas and soups, but Claudia Serrato serves her exquisite tamales de chile rojo \u2014 made with freshly ground nixtamalized blue corn and filled with tender, braised bison \u2014 plain, exactly as they are, with nothing else on the plate. The tamal is so deeply flavored, so perfumed with corn and chiles, that it doesn\u2019t need a thing to hold your attention. Eat these the day you steam them, when they\u2019re still piping with steam from the tamalera, and the next day, fry leftover unwrapped tamales in a hot pan for a perfect holiday breakfast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/23/dining/18Tamalesrex2/merlin_181221021_efd57f54-ddd2-445c-80a2-5c93c8d58b09-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "About 20 tamales", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "corn husks, masa de maiz azul, vegetable shortening", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "recipeIngredient": ["40 dried corn husks (from about 1 pound)", "4 cups harina de ma\u00edz nixtamalizado azul (blue corn masa flour); see Notes", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "2 cups meat or vegetable broth or water; see Notes", "1 pound vegetable shortening (2 1/4 cups)", "1 tablespoon coarse sea salt", "3 3/4 cups Carne con Chile Rojo, for filling <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021732-carne-con-chile-rojo-chuck-braised-in-chile\">(see recipe)</a>"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sort through the husks to get 20 large ones and place in a large bowl, along with 10 additional smaller husks.

Using the back of a spoon or a small palette knife, spread about 1/3 cup masa (2 ounces) in a rectangle (about 5- by 6-inches) in the center, leaving a few inches empty on the long sides. Add 3 tablespoons meat filling (2 ounces) in a line down the center of the masa. Wrap the tamal: Hold the long sides of the husk and bring them together, so the masa meets in the center and encloses the filling, then fold those sides of the husk together over and around the enclosed filling. Fold the pointed end over the tamal to secure and place on a sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, stacking the folded tamales on the pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To steam the tamales: Place a few coins in the bottom of a tamalera or other deep steamer pot and add enough water to come to the bottom of the steamer insert and no higher so the water won\u2019t touch the tamales. The coins will stop clattering if your water runs low and let you know that you need to replenish with more hot water. Arrange the tamales upright in the steamer, open-side up, leaving a space in the center. The tamales should be touching. Cover the tops with the remaining corn husks, then cover the steamer with the lid. Bring the water to a boil and steam for 1 hour, pouring in more water through the empty center as needed."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To test for doneness, remove one tamal, unwrap and cut through the center. There should be no raw masa remaining, and the tamal should peel away easily from the husk as you unwrap it. If not, continue steaming, checking for doneness every 15 minutes. When cooked, remove from the heat and let stand in the steamer for 15 minutes before serving. The tamales can be kept warm in the steamer off heat for up to an hour. Steamed tamales can be cooled completely, wrapped tightly, and frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then steam again in husks or unwrap and pan-fry until heated through, about 15 minutes."}], "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021731-tamales-de-chile-rojo-red-chile-tamales-with-meat"}
