{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fry Duck With Mushrooms and Broccolini", "description": "The last time I was in Chinon, I had lunch at a charming restaurant, Au Plaisir Gourmand. The name is fitting: Chinon was the birthplace of Rabelais, who valued indulgence at the table. We began with andouilles (tripe sausages) and continued with li\u00e8vre \u00e0 la royale (hare stuffed with foie gras), as we poured more than one bottle of Chinon. I have never made either dish. But with these wines I still want something bold, earthy and luscious. Did someone say Asian? Starting with duck breast, sliced thick enough to be succulent in a stir-fry, I added mushrooms, broccolini and musky oyster sauce. Unless you worship at the table of Rabelais, the recipe is more than ample for two.
