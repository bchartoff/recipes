Here, a small part of the batter is baked in the baking dish, then the berries, ginger and the rest of the batter is layered on top to prevent the blueberries from sinking and burning. For maximum lemon flavor, zest the lemon over the batter in Step 3. You can substitute any type of fresh fruit \u2014 berries, grapes, or cherries; just remember to adjust the amount of sugar you add accordingly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/13/dining/ns-clafoutis/merlin_187482114_f3297270-bfc0-423b-a6ec-9ce3b9578639-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "blueberry, ginger", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1217}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened, for greasing the pan", "2 cups/480 milliliters whole milk, at room temperature", "3 large eggs", "1 cup/200 grams plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon ground green cardamom", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 cups/280 grams fresh or frozen blueberries", "1/4 cup/55 grams crystallized ginger, chopped small", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for finishing (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack at the upper level and a second in the middle of the oven.
