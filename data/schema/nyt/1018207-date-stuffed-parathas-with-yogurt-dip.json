{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Date-Stuffed Parathas With Yogurt Dip", "description": "This recipe plays fast and loose with the buttery, layered Indian flatbreads called parathas. Traditionally, a flour-and-water yeastless dough is brushed with clarified butter or oil, then folded over onto itself so that the breads puff in the pan when fried. If you\u2019ve ever seen them stuffed, it\u2019s generally with something savory \u2014 potatoes, onions or ground meat and the like, which give them heft and depth. In this version, sugary sliced dates are folded into the layers, then the breads are grilled rather than fried. (But they can be fried if you prefer.) They are sweeter and smokier than the usual parathas, but just as good for scooping up dips of all kinds. Here, they\u2019re paired with a variation on raita, an Indian yogurt, cucumber and mint mixture that\u2019s been garnished with crushed walnuts for crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/07/multimedia/clark-grilled-parathas/clark-grilled-parathas-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 flatbreads", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, cucumber, dates, greek yogurt, whole wheat flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 453, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "284 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/65 grams whole-wheat flour, more for dusting", "1/2 cup/60 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/142 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more as needed for the bowl and brushing", "1/2 cup/80 grams sliced pitted dates (4 to 5 large pitted)", "Olive oil, as needed", "1 cup/236 milliliters Greek yogurt, preferably whole milk", "2 Persian cucumbers, coarsely grated (1/2 cup)", "1 small garlic clove, grated on a Microplane or minced", "2 tablespoons finely chopped mint, plus torn whole leaves for garnish", "Fine sea salt, to taste", "1/4 cup/30 grams toasted walnuts, chopped", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Crushed dried rose petals, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the parathas: In a large bowl, whisk together flours and salt.
