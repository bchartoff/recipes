{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pickled Deviled Eggs", "description": "Before they are deviled, these hard-cooked eggs are pickled in rice vinegar, brown sugar and garlic, along with slivered red onions. The pickling brine dyes the egg whites deep pink, and the onions turn pungently sweet and sour, making a terrific garnish for the deviled eggs. And after the eggs are gone, you\u2019ll still be left with plenty of pickled onions that will last for weeks in the refrigerator. Add them to salads, tacos, grilled meats and sandwiches. You won\u2019t be sorry to have them on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/28/dining/28POTLUCK4/28POTLUCK4-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, dijon mustard, eggs, mayonnaise, red onion, rice vinegar, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 123}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 230, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "272 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 large eggs", "1 1/2 cups rice vinegar", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "2 1/2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "1 large red onion, halved and very thinly sliced", "1 cup mayonnaise", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put eggs in a large pot of cold water and bring to a boil.
