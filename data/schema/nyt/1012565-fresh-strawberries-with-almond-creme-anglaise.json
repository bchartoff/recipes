{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Strawberries With Almond Cr\u00e8me Anglaise", "description": "Strawberries, like asparagus, peaches, corn and a few other joys of summer, are perhaps best enjoyed unadulterated, at least at the beginning of the season, when the thrill of their newness is fresh. Later on, when you\u2019re on your 10th quart, it\u2019s time to tinker. I craved a kind of cr\u00e8me anglaise, a cooked but marginally thickened custard. But I wanted something a little more exciting than the standard vanilla-scented one. By jolting the custard with toasted almonds, I met that need, and with only a tad more work than in the original version. \n\nStrain out the cooked almonds if you want a creamy sauce (and you should). Served warm, over good strawberries, with slivered almonds as a garnish, this is almost as good an option as shortcake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/01/dining/strawberry/strawberry-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "dessert, eggs, milk, strawberries, gluten-free, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 100}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 363, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "29 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup chopped almonds plus 1/2 cup lightly toasted slivered almonds", "1 cup milk", "1 cup cream", "1/2 cup sugar", "4 egg yolks", "6 to 8 cups strawberries, washed, hulled and quartered"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put chopped almonds in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
