{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Oven-Fried Rice With Gochujang and Fried Eggs", "description": "This crunchy, tasty, not-really-fried rice gets a big umami punch from gochujang, the fermented Korean red-pepper paste that\u2019s worth keeping in your fridge to perk up all sorts of dishes. As with any fried rice, you can add raw or cooked vegetables according to what you have on hand (though you\u2019ll want to add cooked vegetables a little later in the cooking process). If you don\u2019t have brussels sprouts, you could use any type of cabbage. Broccoli or cauliflower would be great substitutes for broccolini, and butternut squash can replace the carrots. The fried egg on top makes it feel like a more substantial meal, but you can leave it out for a lighter dinner. If you are a vegetarian, leave out the sausage, or add some smoked tofu. The dish is endlessly customizable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/dining/ss-fried-rice/ss-fried-rice-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, grains and rice, vegetables", "keywords": "broccolini, brown rice, brussels sprouts, carrot, gochujang, sausage, shiitake, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 422}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups uncooked short-grain brown rice, or 4 cups cooked, chilled white rice", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as vegetable, canola or grapeseed oil", "2 links turkey or pork sausage (about 6 ounces total), removed from casings", "2 carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick coins", "4 scallions, sliced, green and white parts separated", "1/4 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced", "1/4 pound brussels sprouts, thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "2 large stalks broccolini, chopped (about 1 cup)", "Kosher salt", "1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean red-pepper paste)", "2 tablespoons low-sodium tamari or soy sauce", "4 fried eggs, for serving (optional)", "Dark sesame oil, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using uncooked rice, combine the rice and 2 1/2 cups water in a small, deep saucepan and bring to a boil.
