{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gochujang Barbecue Sauce", "description": "The chef Tory Miller dreamed up this spicy, sweet barbecue sauce during the pandemic when he was running his Miller Family Meat & Three pop-up in Madison, Wis. It\u2019s an ode to his family\u2019s love of grilling and his Korean heritage, which, as an adoptee, he has been exploring more in recent years. Mr. Miller uses this as he would any other barbecue sauce: for basting meats as they finish grilling and for dipping nuggets. He loves the smokiness the bacon adds to the sauce, but here it\u2019s optional. (Though if using, you can add the drained bacon to a sandwich with white bread, coleslaw and pickles, or simply keep in the sauce).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Elyse Inamine"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/03/dining/03Korean-Adoptees-Rex2/merlin_206814057_41417709-2903-470a-b6e5-da44f08d2ed3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "About 1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "american, korean", "recipeCategory": "barbecues, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "brown sugar, gochujang, ketchup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 121}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (\u00bc-inch-thick) slice smoky bacon (optional)", "1 cup ketchup", "1/3 cup brown sugar", "2 tablespoons molasses", "2 tablespoons gochujang", "2 tablespoons cider vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons yellow mustard", "3/4 teaspoon onion powder", "3/4 teaspoon granulated garlic", "3/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper", "3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper sauce", "Pinch smoked paprika"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using the bacon, cook in a small skillet over medium heat until crisp, 6 to 8 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, combine the remaining ingredients in a medium saucepan with \u00bc cup water and bring to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the crisped bacon to the saucepan, if using.
