{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brussels Sprouts With Pickled Shallots and Labneh", "description": "Pickled onions and labneh lend brightness to this brussels sprouts dish that\u2019s full of flavors and textures, making it a show-stopping addition to the Thanksgiving table. (But why limit yourself there?) This recipe calls for date syrup, available at Middle Eastern grocery stores or online, or pekmez, a type of molasses made from grapes (and sometimes other fruit) used in Turkish cooking. If you can\u2019t find either, use the same amount of maple syrup or honey. Some of the fruity and woody flavors will be missing, but these substitutes will provide much-needed sweetness to the rest of the dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/dining/11brussels-sprouts/ns-brussels-sprouts-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, date syrup, garlic, labneh, fall, thanksgiving, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1497}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup apple cider vinegar", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large shallot, peeled and sliced into rings", "1 pound brussels sprouts", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing", "Fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 cup labneh", "1 garlic clove, peeled and grated", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons date syrup or pekmez (or even maple syrup or honey), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pickled shallots: In a small jar or bowl, mix the vinegar, sugar, black pepper and salt.
