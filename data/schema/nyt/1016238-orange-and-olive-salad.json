{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orange and Olive Salad", "description": "Temple oranges are shiny, spongy to the touch and deeply rutted with pores, like a cartoonist\u2019s idea of an orange. The temple orange, which arrives at stores in the winter, is worth seeking out. Start with the peel, which is thin and tight to the pulp yet zippers off as cleanly as that of the tangerine. The segments have little pith, and though their skin is delicate, they separate neatly, sparing your shirt. Pop a sector, fat and pulpy, into your mouth, and the thing just bursts. Temples are far juicier than most oranges, with a tarter, more complex taste. This is a recipe, adapted from \u201cJane Grigson\u2019s Fruit Book\u201d (Atheneum, 1982), that showcases their sweetness, set off by bitter greens, salty olives and black pepper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Patrick Farrell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/10/dining/templeorange-still/templeorange-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 165, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "414 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 temple oranges", "4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon wine vinegar", "Salt and pepper", "2 medium heads chicory or curly endive", "3/4 cup kalamata or oil-cured olives, chopped", ""], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate the zest of 2 oranges.
