{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Summer Fruit Tart", "description": "Use this crunchy, flaky tart recipe as a template for any ripe summer fruit you have, adjusting the sugar and cornstarch depending on how sweet and juicy the fruit is (see Tip). Made from store-bought puff pastry that\u2019s been coated in Demerara sugar, the crust caramelizes as it bakes, turning shiny and crisp enough to shatter when you bite down. And feel free to change up the seasonings and substitute 1/2 teaspoon ground spices or grated lemon zest for the vanilla. It\u2019s an easy, fuss-free dessert that seems like a lot more work than it actually is. For maximum flakiness, serve this on the same day that it\u2019s baked.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/28/dining/23apperex1/merlin_186703752_a2e41c34-cc86-4f90-b20e-f1b028e8f53c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "berries, puff pastry, stone fruit, fourth of july, mother\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 649}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons Demerara sugar, plus more as needed", "2 to 5 tablespoons granulated sugar (see Tip)", "2 to 3 tablespoons cornstarch (see Tip)", "Pinch of kosher salt", "4 cups berries, or pitted and sliced stone fruit (peaches, nectarines, apricots, plums), or rhubarb (or use a combination of stone fruit and berries)", "1 tablespoon lemon juice or mild vinegar, such as rice wine vinegar or balsamic", "1 tablespoon honey, plus more as needed", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "All-purpose flour, for dusting the work surface", "1 (14-ounce) package puff pastry, preferably made with butter, thawed if frozen, but still very cold", "Whipped cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or ice cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 400 degrees.
