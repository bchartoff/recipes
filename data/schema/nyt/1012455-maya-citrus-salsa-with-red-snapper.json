The combination here \u2014 orange, grapefruit, lemon \u2014 is not traditional to Mayan cooking, nor is it a mandate. Add lime if you have it, a bitter orange if you can find it. Don\u2019t skip the minced habanero, though, which adds a bit of heat and yet more flavor. The fish starts on the stove for a few minutes, and is soon moved to the oven to finish cooking, for a total time of less than 10 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/11/dining/11snapper/11snapper-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "citrus, red snapper, dairy-free, gluten-free, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 178}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 242, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "585 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 orange", "1 small grapefruit", "1 large lemon", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "1/2 habanero or other chili, seeded and minced, or to taste", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons oil", "4 red snapper fillets, 4 to 6 ounces each, preferably skin on (and scaled)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
