{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Pork With Citrus and Mint", "description": "In this recipe for a Thai-inspired salad, made for a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker, crispy pork, flavored with fish sauce and lime, is paired with sweet and juicy pomelo (or use grapefruit) and heady fried garlic chips. If you\u2019d rather make this in a slow cooker, you can; it'll take 5 to 7 hours on high. (You can also make it in a stovetop pressure cooker, by trimming a few minutes off the cooking time. The stovetop versions tend to operate at a slightly higher pressure, cooking food more quickly.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/01/dining/01APPE2/01APPE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "cucumber, fish sauce, grapefruit, jalape\u00f1o, lime, mint, pork shoulder, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 418}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 480, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "665 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons honey", "Finely grated zest of 2 limes", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "4 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2 or 3 pieces", "1 tablespoon peanut oil, more as needed", "1 bunch of cilantro, leaves and stems separated", "3 tablespoons Asian fish sauce", "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar", "1 small red or green chile, sliced", "1 pomelo or 3 grapefruits", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lime juice", "1/4 teaspoon honey", "6 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced (about 4 cups)", "Leaves from 1 bunch of cilantro", "Leaves from 1 bunch of mint", "1 to 2 jalape\u00f1os, thinly sliced, seeds removed or not, to taste", "Fine sea salt, to taste", "Cooked rice or rice noodles, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate 1 garlic clove into a small bowl, then stir in honey, lime zest, salt and pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut 1-inch deep slits all over pork.
