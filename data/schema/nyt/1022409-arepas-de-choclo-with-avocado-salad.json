{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arepas de Choclo With Avocado Salad", "description": "Arepas, corn cakes that are a cornerstone of Colombian and Venezuelan cuisines, come in many guises, depending on the region, the season and the available ingredients. This slightly sweet, cheese-filled version, called arepas de choclo, is adapted from \u201cColombiana\u201d (HarperCollins, 2021), a cookbook by the Colombian food stylist Mariana Vel\u00e1squez. The dough, which uses a combination of fresh corn kernels and yellow masarepa (precooked cornmeal), fries up into rich, moist, golden cakes that are like a more delicate version of the mozzarella-stuffed arepas found at street fairs. Ms. Vel\u00e1squez pairs these with a lemony tomato and avocado salad to offer a soft and juicy contrast to the crisp-edged cakes. Perfect for a summery brunch, these also make an excellent light lunch or dinner. If you can\u2019t find masarepa (P.A.N. is one brand available in large supermarkets), Ms. Vel\u00e1squez recommends substituting instant polenta. But don\u2019t use masa harina, which is a different product altogether.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a> newsletter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/21/dining/16apperex/merlin_190467327_eaa91f4b-de2c-467b-96f1-40a47dc642cd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "avocado, cast iron, cherry tomatoes, colombian, corn, food processor, ricotta, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 772}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup corn kernels (fresh or frozen, thawed)", "1 cup precooked yellow cornmeal, such as masarepa or instant polenta (see Tip)", "1 cup quesito or whole-milk ricotta", "1/2 cup grated Manchego or Parmesan (2 ounces)", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "3/4 cup whole or 2 percent milk", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus 3 tablespoons for frying", "2 medium Hass avocados, pitted, peeled and cubed", "2 cups halved cherry tomatoes", "Juice of 1 lemon", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup torn fresh cilantro, for garnish", "1/2 cup crumbled quesito or queso fresco, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, process corn until kernels break down and mixture is smooth.
