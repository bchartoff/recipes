{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate-Chip Banana Bread", "description": "This recipe uses four bananas, which is more than is typical for a single loaf. The natural sugars from the ripe, brown bananas keep the bread incredibly moist for up to one week, even sliced. The high moisture of the batter can make it tricky to determine doneness, so take care not to underbake the the loaf. It should have a dry, shiny, cracked surface, and a tester inserted into the thickest portion should come out with a few moist crumbs attached. Serve this banana bread for breakfast or brunch, or even as a simple dessert, topped with a scoop of coffee ice cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/25/dining/em-chocolate-chip-banana-bread/em-chocolate-chip-banana-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, cakes", "keywords": "banana, brown sugar, chocolate, greek yogurt, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 498}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick spray, as needed", "4 very ripe medium bananas, peeled", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters plain Greek yogurt", "1 cup/220 grams light or dark brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/135 grams finely chopped chocolate or mini chocolate chips (see Tip)", "3/4 cup/130 grams coarsely chopped toasted nuts, such as almonds, walnuts or pecans (optional)", "Coarse sanding or turbinado sugar, as needed for finishing (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
