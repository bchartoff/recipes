{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach Soup With Coriander, Cinnamon and Allspice", "description": "This soup was inspired by a Syrian recipe, a spice-laced pan-cooked spinach that is served with yogurt and walnuts on top. This recipe uses the same spices in a pur\u00e9ed spinach soup. It works beautifully. Half of the yogurt is stirred into the soup, contributing a tart flavor that\u2019s a great finishing dimension to the soup. The rest is drizzled onto each serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/03/health/03recipehealth/03recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian, main course, spinach, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 137}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 291, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1152 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "1/3 cup finely diced celery", "Salt to taste", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 cup medium-grain rice", "6 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock", "A bouquet garni made with a bay leaf and a couple of sprigs each thyme and parsley", "1 1/2 pounds fresh spinach, stemmed and washed thoroughly in 2 changes of water", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/8 teaspoon ground clove", "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 scant teaspoon coriander seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "2 cups drained yogurt or Greek-style yogurt", "1 small garlic clove (optional)", "1/4 to 1/3 cup chopped walnuts for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, heavy soup pot or Dutch oven, and add the onion and celery.
