{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Microwave-Steamed Eggs", "description": "The reward for this delightful steamed egg dish, smooth and savory, will seem much too high for the effort. Reminiscent of Chinese zheng shui dan, Japanese chawanmushi and Korean gyeran jjim, this streamlined recipe cooks entirely in the microwave. The key to that perfect, soft-set wibble-wobble texture (think silken tofu) is using your microwave at around 500 watts \u2014 or half its power on a 1,000-watt machine. This lower heat lets the eggs and broth steam together gently until they cohere into something ethereal, existing somewhere between liquid and solid. More slurpable than chewable, it tastes fantastic as a light starter or breakfast on its own, or for lunch or dinner alongside steamed rice and other dishes to complete the spread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/29/dining/EK-microwave-steamed-eggs/merlin_195007317_11c416b4-5607-44f7-8781-de6af1c64076-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, easy, for two, lunch, quick, snack, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "dashi, eggs, maple syrup, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2022}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large eggs", "1 cup instant or kombu dashi (see Tip), vegetable or chicken broth, or water", "Pinch of salt", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1 teaspoon maple syrup", "1 tablespoon finely snipped chives or scallion greens, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium, microwave-safe shallow cereal bowl, whisk together the eggs, dashi and salt until very well combined, at least 30 seconds.
