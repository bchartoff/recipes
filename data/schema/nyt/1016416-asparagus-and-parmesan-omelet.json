Add 2 teaspoons of the olive oil. When the oil feels hot when you hold your hand above it, pour in the eggs, scraping every last bit into the pan. Swirl the pan to distribute the eggs evenly over the surface. Shake the pan gently, tilting it slightly with one hand while lifting up the edges of the omelet with the spatula in your other hand, to let the eggs run underneath during the first few minutes of cooking. As soon as the eggs are set on the bottom, sprinkle half the asparagus down the middle of the eggs, then jerk the pan quickly away from you then back towards you so that the omelet folds over on itself. If you don\u2019t like your omelet runny in the middle (I do), jerk the pan again so that the omelet folds over once more. Cook for a minute or two longer. Tilt the pan and roll out onto a plate. Repeat with the remaining eggs, Parmesan herbs, and asparagus, and serve."}]}
