{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Minestrone With Kale and Pasta", "description": "This one-pot springtime minestrone combines asparagus, peas and kale with a healthy dose of fresh ginger. The ginger is optional, but it energizes the broth. This recipe is fairly flexible overall: You can swap green vegetables according to taste, use vegetable or chicken stock and toss in any type of short pasta. The pesto and Parmesan swirled in at the end provide brightness and richness, but you could also finish the soup with tapenade, sour cream, ricotta or even a splash of your favorite hot sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/23/dining/kc-spring-minestrone/merlin_171317157_6ffc6409-8fa0-4a58-87bb-add496e38272-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, pastas, soups and stews, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, celery, ginger, kale, pasta, peas, pesto, vegetable broth, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1275}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large shallots or 1 small onion, thinly sliced", "2 celery stalks, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger (optional)", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "2 quarts low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock", "1 cup ditalini or other small shaped pasta (about 5 ounces)", "8 ounces asparagus, trimmed and sliced into 1/2-inch pieces (1 1/2 cups), thinly sliced zucchini or chopped broccoli", "1 cup fresh or frozen peas", "5 ounces baby kale, baby spinach or torn spinach (about 4 cups)", "Storebought pesto and grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a heavy soup pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium.
