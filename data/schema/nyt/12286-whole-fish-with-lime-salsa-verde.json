{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Fish With Lime Salsa Verde", "description": "Think of roasting a whole fish the same way you might think of roasting a whole chicken: an easy and delicious preparation that all cooks should have in their arsenal, and one that takes well to whatever ingredients you want to introduce. Here, those extra flavors are electric. The fish is stuffed with slices of lime and jalape\u00f1o, cilantro and scallion bottoms. An accompanying salsa is composed of more jalape\u00f1o, scallion tops, cilantro, lime juice and zest, as well as a dose of capers and garlic. The fish itself is simply oiled and seasoned, then roasted at 450 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, until it is opaque and flakes when pressed gently with a fork. (Each person you\u2019re feeding should get his or her own fish, weighing about one or one and a half pounds apiece.) Spoon the salsa on top, a streak of bright, spicy flavor for the delicate, moist fish.
