{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "\u200b\u200bCrisp Roast Duck", "description": "A golden-skinned roasted duck is a festive main course for any special meal. In this recipe, the bird is doused with boiling water before being scored all over. The boiling water helps pull the skin taut, making it easier to score in a crosshatch pattern. That, in turn, allows the fat to render out as everything roasts. The result is a perfectly cooked duck with pink, juicy meat and burnished, crunchy skin. Serve the bird as is, or with some kind of sauce \u2014 either sweet or pungent \u2014 such as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015626-red-wine-cranberry-sauce-with-honey\">cranberry sauce,</a> <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12286-whole-fish-with-lime-salsa-verde\">salsa verde</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018994-soy-dipping-sauce\">a spicy soy dipping sauce.</a> And save the duck fat at the bottom of the pan. It will keep for at least three months in the refrigerator and is excellent on roasted vegetables, especially potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/15/dining/10Appe-rex/merlin_198330969_23004ba5-8cb2-4b4d-95f4-13d1a8777d67-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "christmas, new year\u2019s day, plan-ahead, whole duck", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 735}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (5- to 6-pound) whole duck", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "2 large garlic cloves, finely grated, passed through a garlic press or finely minced", "1 tablespoon chopped thyme or rosemary leaves, or a combination, plus more sprigs for the cavity", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon or orange zest, or a combination", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander or a spice mix, such as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021923-garam-masala\"> garam masala </a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021924-baharat-blend\">baharat</a>(optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a full kettle or medium pot of water to a boil (at least 2 quarts)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, remove giblets and neck from the duck cavity and reserve for another use.

After piercing the skin, use the knife blade to score the duck breast in a crosshatch pattern (making deep cuts into the skin only, and not into the breast meat).
