Instead, the lamb is moistened with a yogurt-based marinade laced with fresh mint, orange zest and cardamom. The yogurt keeps the surface of the lamb from drying out and \u2014 if you let the lamb sit for a while after you\u2019ve smeared it with the marinade (and you should) \u2014 it permeates the meat a bit with the flavors of the marinade. This needs no accompaniment, but if you\u2019re in the mood for some heat, a dab of harissa wouldn\u2019t be out of place.\n\nDon't know <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/magazine/100000000773719/carving-lamb.html\">how to carve a lamb</a>?
