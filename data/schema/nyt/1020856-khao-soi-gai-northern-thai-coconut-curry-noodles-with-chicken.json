{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Khao Soi Gai (Northern Thai Coconut-Curry Noodles With Chicken)", "description": "You\u2019ll find khao soi, a deeply fragrant, coconut milk-based stew, throughout Southeast Asia, but the dish is a specialty of Chiang Mai, a city in Northern Thailand. Chicken is simmered in a creamy, spicy-sweet broth, then served over boiled egg noodles and garnished with crunchy fried noodles. (When made with beef, the dish is called khao soi nuea.) This version is adapted from Noree Thai, a restaurant in Los Angeles, which Noree Pla owns with her partner, the chef Fern Kaewtathip. Ms. Pla serves the khao soi she learned from her mother, which requires more than a dozen ingredients, but once you have the ingredients prepared, the dish comes together in less than an hour. For a lighter broth, use about half of the curry paste; for a more pungent khao soi, use it all.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Daniela Galarza"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/04/dining/dg-khao-soi/merlin_168064230_287d5cd1-0926-4bce-a9b8-bb9eb33b7ddd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, curries, noodles, poultry", "keywords": "chicken legs, coconut milk, egg noodles, lime leaves, thai chili, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 dried red Thai chiles (or chiles de \u00e1rbol)", "2 fresh or dried makrut lime leaves (optional)", "15 cilantro stems with leaves (about 1/4 bunch)", "2 large shallots or 1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped", "2 (1 1/2- to 2-inch) pieces fresh, unpeeled turmeric, scrubbed and roughly chopped (or 2 tablespoons ground turmeric)", "1 (4-inch) piece lemongrass, from the base of the stalk, sliced", "1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped", "4 large garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "1 teaspoon shrimp paste or 2 teaspoons fish sauce (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest (preferably from a fresh makrut lime)", "3 cups neutral oil", "1 (16-ounce) package dried, flat Chinese-style egg noodles, or dried tagliatelle pasta nests", "Kosher salt", "2 (13-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk (not shaken or stirred)", "2 cups chicken broth (preferably low-sodium)", "Kosher salt", "8 chicken leg drumsticks (about 2 pounds)", "2 to 4 tablespoons fish sauce", "2 to 4 tablespoons palm sugar or brown sugar", "1/2 cup homemade or store-bought Yunnanese-style pickled mustard greens, for serving", "1 shallot, peeled and thinly sliced, for serving", "Chile paste or chile oil, for serving", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the curry paste: Bring 1/4 cup of water to a boil in a\u00a0small saucepan.
