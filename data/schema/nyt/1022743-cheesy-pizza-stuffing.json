{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Pizza Stuffing", "description": "Imagine Thanksgiving stuffing, but with the red-sauce flavors of cheese pizza. Tomato paste and dried oregano, bloomed in buttery onions, do the heavy lifting in this comforting dish, as does an ivory shower of shredded mozzarella, which melts and gets gooey in spots. Stale bread works best, so dry out the bread the night before you plan to make this, or bake the torn pieces in a 250-degree oven until they\u2019re brittle. You can also assemble the stuffing the night before Thanksgiving; just keep it covered in the refrigerator and bake it the next day while the turkey is resting. Serve this warm, while the cheese is still molten.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15BEGINNERREX2-STUFFING/15BEGINNERREX2-STUFFING-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "stuffing and dressing, side dish", "keywords": "bread, mozzarella, onion, oregano, tomato paste, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 442}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (12- to 14-ounce) loaf brioche or challah, torn into bite-size pieces (about 4 cups)", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more softened butter for greasing dish", "1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced", "Salt and black pepper", "1 teaspoon dried oregano, plus more for topping", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 cup vegetable stock", "1 large egg", "1 cup whole milk", "2 cups shredded low-moisture mozzarella"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The night before serving, spread the bread pieces on a sheet pan and let sit on the counter to dry out.
