{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Mashed Potatoes", "description": "This very simple recipe for silky mashed potatoes calls for roasting potatoes whole instead of chopping and boiling them, which concentrates their flavor and avoids a watery final product. The riced potatoes are light and fluffy, and just enough milk and butter are added to create rich, velvety potatoes while still  allowing pure potato flavor to shine through. The mashed potatoes can be made a few hours ahead and pressed on top with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming; rewarm over low heat before serving, adding a touch more milk if necessary.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/27/dining/kc-creamy-mashed-potatoes1/kc-creamy-mashed-potatoes1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, side dish", "keywords": "mashed potato, milk, russet potatoes, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 223}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds medium russet potatoes", "1 \u00bd cups whole milk", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Individually wrap potatoes in aluminum foil and arrange on a baking sheet.
