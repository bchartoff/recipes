{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fabrizia Lanza\u2019s Sicilian Pizza (Sfincione)", "description": "Palermo, the capital of Sicily, is street-food paradise, and among its many offerings is sfincione, a hearty pizza that\u2019s baked in a rimmed sheet pan, allowing the dough to rise to a chewy thickness, and cut into large square slices. Sfincione is smeared with a frugal tomato sauce enhanced with umami from sheep\u2019s milk cheese, onions and anchovy, along with olive oil and a handful of bread crumbs to make the cheese go further. When baked, the top is juicy, while the bottom is crisp from the generously oiled pan. Despite its origins as a street food, it is the perfect pizza to make at home. This easy and authentic recipe is from Fabrizia Lanza, proprietor of the Anna Tasca Lanza Cooking School, on the family\u2019s country estate near Palermo.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/05/dining/05kitchenrex1/merlin_147457287_3700e223-72be-4dd8-a70e-275066fd386f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "anchovy, pecorino, tomato puree, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 153}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "618 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon dry active yeast", "1/4 cup/45 grams\u00a0fine semolina", "2 cups/255\u00a0grams 00 flour or all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing pan and drizzling", "1 small onion, thinly sliced", "1 1/2 cups\u00a0plain tomato sauce\u00a0(look for passata, which is not a thick pur\u00e9e)", "Salt and pepper", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes, or to taste", "1 cup fine dry bread crumbs", "1 cup/85 grams grated pecorino or other sheep\u2019s cheese (3 ounces)", "8 anchovy fillets, cut into 1-inch pieces", "Dried oregano, preferably Sicilian"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a mixing bowl or bowl of a stand mixer, put 1 cup lukewarm water and yeast.
