It isn't exactly a quick recipe, but it's far easier than the classic dish and equally satisfying.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/26/dining/26APPE_SPAN/26APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "eggplant, ground lamb, potato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 235}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 602, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1145 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium eggplant about 2 pounds, cut into 3/4-inch cubes", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes", "1/3 cup whole milk", "1 large egg yolk", "3/4 cup grated kefalotiri or Parmesan cheese", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1 pound ground lamb (or beef)", "1 very large onion, finely chopped", "2 cinnamon sticks", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon ground clove", "2 medium tomatoes, cored and chopped", "1/2 teaspoon pepper", "3 tablespoons bread crumbs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a colander, toss the eggplant and 1 teaspoon salt.
