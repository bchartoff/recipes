{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Parmesan Eggs With Radicchio and Pea Salad", "description": "The true stars of this main course salad are the Parmesan fried eggs, which have lacy, golden edges that are almost fricolike in their crunch. As the runny yolks leak onto the radicchio and vegetables, they mix with the lemony dressing, making the whole salad creamy and rich. It\u2019s best to shred the Parmesan yourself, using the largest holes on your grater; the preground stuff is usually too fine. Then be sure to use a nonstick skillet or well-seasoned cast-iron pan to fry the eggs; otherwise, they are liable to glue themselves onto a regular pan. And if you aren\u2019t an anchovy fan but still want to add a saline bite, a tablespoon of drained capers also works well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/19/dining/14apperex1/14apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, weekday, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "cucumber, kalamata olives, parmesan, radicchio, snap peas, tomato, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "recipeIngredient": ["Fine sea salt", "1 1/2 cups sugar snap peas, trimmed", "1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons coarsely grated (not ground) Parmesan", "4 eggs", "Black pepper", "1 medium head radicchio, cored and torn into bite-size pieces (about 6 cups)", "1/4 cup sliced pitted black olives, such as Kalamata", "1/2 cup halved cherry or grape tomatoes", "1 cup sliced cucumber, preferably Persian or mini", "8 oil-packed anchovy fillets (optional)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1 small garlic clove, finely grated or mashed to a paste", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for serving", "Large pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a bowl with water and ice.
