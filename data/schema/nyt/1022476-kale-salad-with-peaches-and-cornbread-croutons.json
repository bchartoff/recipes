{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kale Salad With Peaches and Cornbread Croutons", "description": "This Southern-inspired tossed salad contrasts bitter greens with plump peaches, piquant blue cheese and crispy cornbread crumbs. Seasoned with smoked paprika, onion powder and a hefty dose of pepper, the cornbread crumbs bring serious flavor and texture. While they could be roasted in the oven, saut\u00e9eing them in a skillet allows you to better monitor their doneness, and turns the tiniest crumbs brown and extra crunchy while the larger pieces toast until golden but still tender. Sprinkle leftover croutons over salad greens, raw sliced tomatoes or any range of roasted vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/23/dining/aw-kale-salad/aw-kale-salad-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "blue cheese, cornbread, kale, peach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 229}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1/4 teaspoon onion powder", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "4 to 5 ounces store-bought or homemade cornbread, torn into small pieces (about 2 cups)", "1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced", "4 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "1 1/2 tablespoons coarse-grain Dijon mustard", "1 1/2 teaspoons honey", "1 pound curly kale, destemmed and torn into bite-size pieces (about 8 packed cups)", "2 large ripe peaches (or nectarines), halved, pitted and sliced into thin wedges", "4 ounces tender blue cheese, such as Gorgonzola, crumbled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cornbread croutons: In a medium bowl, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil with the paprika, onion powder and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper.
