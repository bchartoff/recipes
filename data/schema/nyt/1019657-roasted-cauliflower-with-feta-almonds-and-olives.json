{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Cauliflower With Feta, Almonds and Olives", "description": "Roasted cauliflower is a pure delight, but tossing it with feta, toasted almonds and olives makes it even better. The additions come together while the cauliflower roasts, allowing you to assemble this side in no time. If almonds aren't available, walnuts or hazelnuts are good substitutions. This dish works well served warm, but it's equally good at room temperature if you want to make it ahead. Serve with grilled pork chops or pan-seared chicken thighs with lemon and herbs, or fold it into cooked grains, such farro or rice, for a hearty grain salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/ch-roasted-cauliflower-with-feta-almonds-olives/ch-roasted-cauliflower-with-feta-almonds-olives-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, vegetables", "keywords": "almond, cauliflower, feta, olives, fall, spring, winter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1228}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 277, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "795 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium head of cauliflower (about 2 1/2 pounds), cut into florets", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1/4 cup roughly chopped almonds", "1/3 heaping cup/about 2 ounces crumbled feta", "1/2 cup pitted and roughly chopped green olives", "2 tablespoons finely chopped Italian parsley", "1/2 lemon, to taste", "Flaky salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
