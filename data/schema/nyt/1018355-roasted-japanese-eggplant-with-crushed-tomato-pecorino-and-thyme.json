{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Japanese Eggplant With Crushed Tomato, Pecorino and Thyme", "description": "This roasted eggplant was adapted from a recipe from the Phoenix chef Chris Bianco, who regularly showcases Arizona eggplant as an antipasto at his restaurants Pizzeria Bianco and Tratto. But it works just as well with thick sliced conventional eggplant, and tomato sauce or sweet peppers substituted for the heirloom tomato. The succulent roasted eggplant comes together with the comforting flavors of the thyme, garlic and tomato. Serve as a side, or pair with polenta or fresh bread to round out a main course.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brett Anderson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/19/dining/19PIZZA5/19PIZZA5-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings as an antipasto, or 2 as a main dish", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, japanese eggplant, pecorino, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 156}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 297, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "18 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1417 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 small Japanese eggplants", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided", "Sea salt", "Cracked black pepper", "1 large, very ripe heirloom tomato", "2 cloves garlic, crushed", "4 sprigs of fresh thyme", "2 ounces pecorino di Fossa (or Parmigiano-Reggiano), shaved or thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the eggplant and place in a roasting pan or dish.
