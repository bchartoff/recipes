{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salt-Baked New Potatoes With Pink-Peppercorn Butter", "description": "This way of cooking recently harvested new potatoes, by burying them in a plaster of damp salt and baking them, is a triple pleasure: effortless, tasty and very fun. The salt crust seasons the potatoes perfectly, just as it would if you\u2019d boiled or steamed them in salted water, but the airtight seal concentrates their special flavor and texture. They come out dense, waxy and almost creamy. Bring the pan of cooked potatoes to the table right from the oven as is, so everyone can puzzle over the curious-looking white crust, and then delight over the discovery of the piping hot little beauties revealed inside once the surface is cracked. Dig them out and swoop through the butter before popping into your mouth, their skins so paper-thin they snap when you bite into them. Their appeal is irresistible.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/magazine/04mag-Eat/04mag-Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "pink peppercorns, potato, rosemary, waxy potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1276}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds small, yellow-fleshed waxy potatoes (it\u2019s fine if skins are red or purple or yellow)", "2 pounds kosher salt", "2 tablespoons fresh rosemary needles, stripped from their branch", "2 tablespoons pink peppercorns", "1 tablespoon pink peppercorns", "1 or 2 soft, velvety branches of rosemary (versus the very stiff, broom-bristle kind)", "4 ounces salted Irish butter, tempered at room temperature until cool and waxy"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
