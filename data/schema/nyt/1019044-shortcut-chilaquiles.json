{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shortcut Chilaquiles", "description": "Chilaquiles, a traditional Mexican dish made with fried tortillas simmered in red or green salsa, has become a popular breakfast item because it begs to be topped with a couple of fried eggs. This cheater's version is made with a fresh tomato (or tomatillo) salsa that doesn't require a blender, and tortilla chips or broken tostadas instead of fried tortillas. The perfect texture here is softened but not soggy; you want to make sure the chips are tossed evenly with the sauce, but not so much that they get lost in it. Fried eggs are the perfect complement here, as the crisp-edged white provides texture and the yolk a rich sauciness. But it would be just as delicious served underneath or alongside a pile of soft scrambled eggs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/30/dining/30COOKING-CHILAQUILES-ROJOS/30COOKING-CHILAQUILES-ROJOS-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, weekday, weeknight", "keywords": "eggs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 236}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 542, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "815 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small red or yellow onion, thinly sliced into rings", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, plus more if desired", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "4 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, cored and sliced into 1-inch wedges", "1 small Serrano or jalape\u00f1o chile, seeds removed if you like, finely chopped (optional)", "6 ounces tortilla chips or tostadas, broken up into chip-size pieces", "4 large eggs", "4 ounces queso fresco, crumbled", "1 cup cilantro, tender leaves and stems", "1/2 cup crema (or sour cream, thinned with a bit of water) (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place half the onions in a small bowl and cover with lime juice.
