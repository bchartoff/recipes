{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rendang Daging (Beef Rendang)", "description": "Rendang is one of the national dishes of Indonesia, and its tender, caramelized meat is usually reserved for special events, such as weddings, dinners with important guests, and Lebaran, the Indonesian name for Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan. Bathed in coconut milk and aromatics like galangal and lemongrass then reduced until almost all moisture is evaporated, rendang can be served with turmeric rice. Rendang, a dish designed to keep for hours on a journey, has traditionally fed young Indonesians leaving home for the first time on merantau, a right of passage that teaches them about the bitterness and sweetness of life. Created by the Minangkabau, an ethnic group native to West Sumatra, this version from Lara Lee\u2019s cookbook, \u201cCoconut & Sambal,\u201d is a nod to the multiple iterations of rendang across the nation, culminating in a rich and hearty slow-cooked meal. Rendang keeps in the fridge for several day or frozen for up to three months; to reheat, cover the beef with foil and heat in the oven at 300 degrees for about 25 minutes, or until piping hot, or microwave uncovered for three minutes stirring halfway through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kayla Stewart"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/dining/27Leerex1/merlin_177925263_f70efedc-ebc2-45d8-b56c-1c35c59514b2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indonesian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, meat, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "beef, brisket, coconut milk, galangal, ginger, lemongrass, lime leaves, turmeric, eid al-fitr", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 211}, "recipeIngredient": ["7 long red chiles (about 4 ounces), such as cayenne, trimmed, sliced and deseeded if you prefer less heat", "6 shallots, preferably Thai, or 3 small banana shallots, peeled and sliced", "5 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced", "1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced", "1 (3-inch) piece fresh galangal (optional), woody stem removed then thinly sliced", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh turmeric, peeled and sliced, or 1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 1/4 pounds braising beef, such as shin or brisket", "3 1/3 cups full-fat coconut milk", "2 fresh lemongrass stalks, bruised and tied in a knot", "5 fresh makrut lime leaves (optional)", "3 fresh or dried bay leaves", "1 teaspoon sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the spice paste: In a small food processor, combine the spice paste ingredients and blend until they form a smooth paste.
