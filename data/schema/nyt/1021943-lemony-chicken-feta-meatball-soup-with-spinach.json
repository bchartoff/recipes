{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemony Chicken-Feta Meatball Soup With Spinach", "description": "Some might be suspicious of the rolled oats called for in this recipe, but used in place of breadcrumbs, they help create a light and tender chicken meatball. A half-cup more is simmered in the broth, which thickens it and provides a pleasant texture. The meatballs, made with ground chicken, feta and fresh dill, swim in a lemony, spinach-filled broth that\u2019s comforting and light, perfect for lunch or dinner. Serve any leftovers with a fresh squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the soup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/23/dining/yf-meatball-soup/merlin_183955152_0869d34c-a014-4dbe-a741-af42738d5981-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "dill, feta, ground chicken, ground turkey, rolled oats", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1668}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground chicken or turkey, preferably dark meat", "1/2 cup crumbled feta", "3/4 cup old-fashioned rolled oats", "1 small red onion, halved (1/2 diced, and 1/2 grated, then squeezed with a paper towel to remove excess liquid)", "1/3 packed cup fresh dill leaves and fine stems, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon plus 1 tablespoon ground turmeric", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "4 cups low-sodium chicken broth or water", "4 packed cups baby spinach (about 5 ounces)", "2 lemons (1 juiced and 1 cut into wedges for serving)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, add the chicken, feta, 1/4 cup oats, the grated onion, most of the dill (reserve about 2 tablespoons for garnish), the cumin, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt.
