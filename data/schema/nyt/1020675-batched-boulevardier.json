The Boulevardier \u2014 a wintertime <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020312-classic-negroni\">Negroni</a> that substitutes bourbon for gin \u2014 swings both ways. Give this blend of bourbon, Campari and sweet vermouth time to mesh in a tightly sealed bottle in the fridge and the drink\u2019s texture skews softer and more velvety. This batch recipe is lightly diluted, enough to enjoy the drink up, without ice, but not so much that it can\u2019t be enjoyed over ice. One rule to follow: If you\u2019re letting the batch sit for more than two weeks, leave the water out and add it the day you\u2019re serving. Otherwise, marry it all, let it sit and drink as desired \u2014 or needed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/dining/27batchrex1/merlin_164785218_c09c99c9-c332-4076-81df-28eefed38933-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "6 (4-ounce) drinks", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bourbon, campari, sweet vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 94}, "recipeIngredient": ["9 ounces bourbon or rye whiskey", "6 ounces Campari", "6 ounces sweet vermouth", "3 ounces filtered water (or up to to 4 1/2 ounces water, if you prefer a more diluted drink)", "Orange peels, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the bourbon, Campari, sweet vermouth and water in a spouted measuring cup or pitcher, or a medium bowl.
