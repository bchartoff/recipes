{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Roasted Breast of Veal", "description": "A whole breast of veal is a succulent, fatty, tender magnificence to enjoy, at any time, but especially so when you have holiday turkey and ham fatigue. It doesn\u2019t make immediate sense that I consider the veal \u2014 with its fat and cartilage and bone and sinew and silver skin \u2014 a light meal, but in my experience, the few bites of sticky tender meat you end up with are so outrageously succulent and hit the spot so hard you don\u2019t need more. The long, slow, low overnight cooking is perfect for both the meat and your schedule if you are trying to pull off a real, civilian party \u2014 and sit down at it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/27/magazine/27feast-recipe4-roasted-veal/27feast-recipe4-roasted-veal-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT12H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 10-20", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "fall, winter, main course, onion, potato, veal", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 31}, "recipeIngredient": ["Whole breast of veal \u2014 approximately 15 pounds", "Salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Ground juniper", "Ground allspice", "Fresh thyme", "Olive oil", "4 Yukon Gold potatoes", "1 large yellow onion", "Dry white wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Vaguely trim breast \u2014 just the fat globs on the rib cage and any especially skanky skin, if it even exists.
