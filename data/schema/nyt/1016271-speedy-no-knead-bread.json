How many novices it attracted to bread baking is anyone\u2019s guess. But certainly there were plenty of existing bread bakers who excitedly tried it, liked it and immediately set about trying to improve it. This is an attempt to cut the start-to-finish time down to a few hours, rather than the original 14 to 20 hours' rising time. The solution is simple: use more yeast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/16/dining/16COOKING-NOKNEADBREAD3/16COOKING-NOKNEADBREAD3-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 big loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, project", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, bread", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 958}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups bread flour", "1 packet (1/4 ounce) instant yeast", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "Oil as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl.
