{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn on the Cob With Green Coriander Butter", "description": "Green coriander, or the fresh seed of a cilantro plant, is known for its intensely aromatic, slightly citrusy, mildly cilantro-ish flavor. Use it anywhere you\u2019d use cilantro: marinades, dressings, hummus; in stews, soups or braises; in herbed rice; with rice noodles or soba; mixed with oil and drizzled atop poached eggs. In this recipe, a handful of traditional Southeast Asian ingredients \u2014 fish sauce, ginger, garlic, chiles and a generous amount of pounded green coriander, of course, are worked into a stick of softened butter. It\u2019s savory and spicy, fragrant and pungent, and the first thing you\u2019ll want to do is slather it all over hot grilled corn. Save the rest of the butter to toss with shellfish or roasted vegetables, or to melt into a bowl of steamed rice. For an extra special treat, brown some of the leftover butter, then toss it with pasta and scallops and a squeeze of lemon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/19/magazine/19eat/19eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "butter, cilantro, coriander seeds, garlic, ginger, serrano chile, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 228}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 serrano chiles, destemmed and minced", "3 tablespoons green coriander seeds", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "4 garlic cloves, finely pounded or grated", "1 tablespoon finely pounded or grated fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon fish sauce", "1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt", "1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro", "Fine sea salt", "4 ears corn, shucked and silk removed", "Coriander flowers, for garnish (optional)", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To grill the corn: Heat gas grill, or prepare a bed of hot coals, then heat and clean grates.
