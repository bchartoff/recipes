{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry Poppy Seed Cake", "description": "This simple one-bowl recipe highlights blueberries and poppy seeds in a fluffy vanilla- and almond-scented batter that comes together in a flash. It travels well, which makes it a perfect picnic dessert or beach snack, and it\u2019s just as good for breakfast the next day. The combination of butter and oil gives the cake great flavor, but, more important, keeps it moist for days on the counter. For those who are not fans of almond extract, feel free to leave it out and replace it with more vanilla extract.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/19/dining/ya-blueberry-poppyseed-cake/ya-blueberry-poppyseed-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch round or 8-inch square cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "blueberry, make-ahead, one bowl, picnic, poppy seeds, sour cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 469}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/62 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters canola or other neutral oil", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup/165 grams sour cream", "1 1/4 teaspoons almond extract (optional)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "3 tablespoons poppy seeds", "1 1/3 cups/186 grams fresh blueberries", "1 tablespoon turbinado sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees.
