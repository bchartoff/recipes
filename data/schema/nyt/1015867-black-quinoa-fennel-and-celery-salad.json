I began with a bulb of fennel and some celery that I had on hand in the refrigerator, the remains of a bag of black quinoa, and fresh herbs from my garden, thinking that I would need to add some unexpected ingredients to achieve something interesting. But the contrasts of textures and the crisp, clean flavors of the fennel and celery in a lemony dressing made for a salad that I can\u2019t resist. Slice the fennel and celery as thin as you can.\n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/31/health/31recipehealth/31recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "474 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium-size fennel bulb (about 10 ounces), quartered, cored and very thinly sliced", "1 long or 2 shorter celery sticks, very thinly sliced", "2 cups cooked black quinoa (about 3/4 cup uncooked)", "1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "2 tablespoons chopped chives", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 small garlic clove, pur\u00e9ed", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a salad bowl, combine the sliced fennel and celery, the quinoa, parsley and chives."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil.
