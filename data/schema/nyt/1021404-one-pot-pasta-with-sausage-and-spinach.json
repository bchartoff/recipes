{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Pasta With Sausage and Spinach", "description": "This is the one-pot recipe to make when chopping an onion feels like too much work. Cooking the pasta in a combination of passata (pur\u00e9ed raw tomatoes) and water seasoned with cumin and red-pepper flakes infuses it with flavor all the way through. Cumin adds a subtle earthiness to the dish, but you can also use the same seasonings as those in the sausage you\u2019ve chosen, like dried oregano, thyme, basil, paprika, fennel seeds or garlic. (Check the ingredients list on the package, if you're not sure.) Baby arugula, kale or other leafy greens could be substituted for the spinach, just make sure to tear or cut them into small, bite-size pieces. To make a vegetarian version, you could use mushrooms in place of the sausage at the start of the recipe, then continue with the rest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/01/dining/yf-one-pot-sausage-and-spinach-pasta/merlin_176001870_00e059d4-4eaa-44dc-a1eb-733f6a1c569c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "cumin, parmesan, pasta, red pepper flakes, sausage, spinach, tomato passata", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2117}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 sweet or hot Italian sausages (5 to 6 ounces), casings removed", "1 (24-ounce) jar passata or (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt", "1 pound cavatappi, fusilli or other small, tubular pasta", "5 packed cups baby spinach (about 5 ounces)", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a 12-inch, deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid or a Dutch oven over medium-high until shimmering.
