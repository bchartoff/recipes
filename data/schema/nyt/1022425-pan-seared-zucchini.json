{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Seared Zucchini", "description": "A zucchini and a steak may not have much in common, but, like steak, zucchini takes incredibly well to the method of quickly searing in a smoking hot pan. Zucchini has a high water content, so cooking it fast means it retains its structure and doesn\u2019t release too much water, and doing so over high heat yields a beautiful char. A quick baste with brown butter, rosemary and garlic adds even more steakhouselike flavor. The recipe calls for 1\u00bd tablespoons butter, but feel free to use a bit more if you like. Finally, choose smaller zucchini if you can; they tend to be less watery, more flavorful, and contain smaller seeds than their larger counterparts. If you can only find larger zucchini (or if you only have a 10-inch skillet), use two zucchini instead of three to avoid crowding the pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/20/dining/lh-pan-seared-zucchini/merlin_190839579_f0034b36-fac8-4d01-b69c-3746c8fe571f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "brown butter, cast iron, zucchini, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 997}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 small zucchini (6 to 8 inches each)\u00a0", "1 tablespoon grapeseed, safflower or other high-heat cooking oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more to taste", "1 garlic clove, peeled and smashed", "1 fresh rosemary sprig (or 1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary)", "Coarse sea salt, for serving", "Lemon zest, for serving", "Red-pepper flakes, for serving\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the zucchini lengthwise on two opposite sides to create flat edges.
