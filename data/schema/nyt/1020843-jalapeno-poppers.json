For a vegetarian variation, sprinkle the stuffed jalape\u00f1os with finely crumbled tortilla chips before baking to complement the crisp-tender chiles and the molten-cheese filling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/dining/aw-jalapeno-poppers/aw-jalapeno-poppers-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "24 poppers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, bacon, cilantro, cream cheese, garlic, jalape\u00f1o, lime, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 238}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 medium jalape\u00f1os (no longer than 3 inches each, about 2/3 pound total)", "8 ounces cream cheese, softened", "Scant 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro", "3 scallions, whites and greens parts,\u00a0trimmed and very thinly sliced (about 1/4 cup)", "1 garlic clove, finely chopped", "1 lime, zested (about 1/2 teaspoon), optional", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "12 thin slices uncooked bacon (thick-cut bacon won\u2019t cook as evenly), halved crosswise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
