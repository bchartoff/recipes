{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Avocado Pesto Pasta", "description": "The addition of avocado lends a lovely creamy texture to this pesto. The ripe fruit imparts richness to the sauce, while nutty roasted pepitas add a deep toasty flavor. If you can only find raw pepitas, simply toss them with olive oil and salt, then toast in a skillet over medium-low heat, stirring, until they start to pop and turn golden brown. Shower the dressed pasta with more crunchy pepitas for a nice contrast to the velvety sauce. Leftover pesto can be refrigerated for two days; press the surface with plastic wrap to avoid discoloration (any browned areas on top should be scraped off before using). The pesto also makes a tasty avocado toast, sandwich spread or crudit\u00e9 dip.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/dining/kc-creamy-avocado-pesto-pasta/merlin_174811086_0e42518e-f896-431f-926d-5c0c5a6d3c3f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "avocado, basil, olive oil, parmesan, pasta, pepitas, fall, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 789}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup roasted, salted pepitas, plus more for garnish", "1 small garlic clove", "1 medium (ripe) avocado", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 3 ounces), plus more for garnish", "3 packed cups fresh basil leaves (about 3 ounces), plus more for garnish", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound fusilli or rotini"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, in a food processor, pulse pepitas and garlic until finely chopped.
