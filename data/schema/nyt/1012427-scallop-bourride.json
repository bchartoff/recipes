{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Scallop Bourride", "description": "Bourride is a Proven\u00e7al fish stew enriched and thickened with aioli, a garlic mayonnaise. It is often made with the same types of \u201ctrash fish\u201d that go into a classic bouillabaisse. But here I use sea scallops. Their creamy sweetness makes this dish a particular indulgence. You will not need more than a green salad and a light fruit dessert to make this a satisfying dinner. A steely, minerally chardonnay can balance and tame the richness of this dish, while an oakier example will enhance its lushness. If you prefer not to make the mayonnaise, you can substitute a commercial brand, seasoned with crushed garlic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/28/dining/bourride-still/bourride-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 16}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1074, "unsaturatedFatContent": "70 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "85 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1511 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups fish stock", "Large pinch saffron threads", "12 thin slices baguette", "1 1/2 cups extra virgin olive oil", "6 large cloves garlic", "1 large egg", "Juice of 1 lemon", "Salt", "Cayenne or espelette pepper", "1 medium fennel bulb", "1 cup finely chopped leek", "1 red bell pepper, seeded, cored and finely chopped", "1 1/2 cups dry white wine, preferably chardonnay", "2 tablespoons Pernod", "28 ounces sea scallops, side tendon trimmed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat stock in saucepan, add saffron and set aside.
