{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggplant and Potato Gratin", "description": "In this side dish inspired by Indian flavors, slices of eggplant and potato sit over a bed of crushed tomatoes seasoned with garlic, cumin and nigella seeds. It\u2019s a wonderful accompaniment to seafood, particularly roasted fish. To cut the cooking time, slice the vegetables even thinner, using a mandolin or food processor. Nigella seeds are sometimes erroneously labeled as black cumin, but they look and taste quite different. They have a triangular shape and a distinct black coat, and the flavor will remind some of alliums. There is no direct substitute, but, for the same texture \u2014 if not the same taste \u2014 you could use sesame seeds.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/22/dining/ns-gratin/ns-gratin-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "cumin, eggplant, nigella seed, potato, tomato, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 200}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 Japanese eggplants (12 ounces total)", "1 russet potato (about 14 ounces)", "2 tablespoons melted ghee or oil, plus more for greasing the baking dish", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon nigella seeds", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, such as Aleppo", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Kosher salt", "1 (14-ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and grated", "2 tablespoons bread crumbs", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
