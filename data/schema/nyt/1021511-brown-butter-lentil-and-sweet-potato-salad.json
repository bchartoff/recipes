{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Butter Lentil and Sweet Potato Salad", "description": "This simple lentil salad has a little secret: a toasty, brown butter vinaigrette perfumed with sage. The dish has as much texture as it does flavor. French green lentils or black lentils are the ideal choice, as they hold their shape well after cooking, but brown lentils will work too, though they\u2019ll be a bit softer. Start testing your lentils for doneness after about 15 minutes of cooking; you want them cooked through but not mushy, and they\u2019re best if they retain some bite. Roasted until tender, the sweet potatoes add richness, but feel free to substitute just about any roasted vegetables. Carrots, beets or red bell peppers would all be delicious in their stead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/02/dining/ya-lentil-and-sweet-potato-salad/merlin_178752402_8eedee6b-ed19-4a0e-9475-53f467778287-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "brown butter, butternut squash, goat cheese, lentils, parsley, sage, sweet potato, fall, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2459}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound sweet potatoes, butternut squash or carrots, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces (about 4 cups)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup French green lentils or black lentils, rinsed", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves and tender stems", "1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese (optional)", "1 tablespoon minced fresh sage leaves", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon maple syrup", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees and set a rack in the center."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the sweet potatoes: On a baking sheet, toss the sweet potatoes with the olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.
