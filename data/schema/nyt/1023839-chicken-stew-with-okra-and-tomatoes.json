Okra is cooked over high heat with the holy trinity (onion, bell pepper and celery) to draw out its moisture and reduce any possibility of sliminess. Make sure to use bone-in chicken thighs: They take a little longer to cook, but they give this stew heft and flavor that you wouldn\u2019t get from boneless.
