{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smacked Cucumber \u2018Quick Kimchi\u2019", "description": "This is not a traditional kimchi, but it approximates the flavor profile, bypassing a lengthier fermentation and instead relying on vinegar. Considered a muchim in Korean \u2014 which can refer to any number of \u201cseasoned\u201d or \u201cdressed\u201d salads or other preparations \u2014 this dish is best eaten right away, or at least within 24 hours, while cucumber\u2019s characteristic crunch is still intact. The smacking step creates craggy edges that help better absorb the spicy, funky dressing, so don\u2019t skip it. If you can, place a bowl under the colander in Step 1 to catch the cucumber brine; it tastes fabulous in a martini. Enjoy this as a side salad alongside any grilled main dish, especially steak, or any type of barbecue. For a vegetarian option, you can swap out the fish sauce for soy sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/08/dining/02kimchirex1/02kimchirex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 2 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, pickles, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "cucumber, fish sauce, garlic, gochugaru, sesame oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 918}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound Persian cucumbers (about 5 to 7), cut into 1-inch pieces on the bias", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated garlic", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sesame oil", "1 tablespoon gochugaru", "2 teaspoons fish sauce", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Coarsely chopped chives, thinly sliced scallions, or cilantro or flat-leaf parsley leaves, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a large cutting board, position your chef\u2019s knife on its side and press the heel of the blade to crush each cucumber piece until it cracks in the center, splits in half or splinters completely into pieces.
