{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bloody Mary Mix", "description": "We\u2019ve made hundreds of thousands of bloody Marys over the decades at Prune, with 11 variations, and this classic base mix has been the stalwart, gleaming engine of them all. The lemon juice is what makes it so bright and zingy, and the Sacramento brand tomato juice is clean, with perfect body, never muddy or thick. Prepared horseradish keeps its bite and moisture just about forever, whereas fresh grated horseradish loses its potency almost immediately, leaving dead bits of pencil shavings in the glass instead \u2014 so resist the urge to \u201cimprove\u201d the recipe. Worcestershire sauce adds greater depth to the umami already inherent in tomato, and the Tabasco brand hot-pepper sauce brings vibrancy with its high acidity but very manageable heat. This bloody Mary is as refreshing as a virgin affair as it is when spiked and garnished.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/17/magazine/17mag-eat/17mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "About 8 to 14 drinks", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "celery, horseradish, tabasco sauce, tomato juice, vodka, worcestershire sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1294}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (46-ounce) can Sacramento brand tomato juice (5 3/4 cups)", "3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon Gold\u2019s Prepared Horseradish", "1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from 3 or 4 juicy lemons)", "1/2 cup Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce", "2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt", "2 teaspoons Tabasco hot sauce", "Ice", "Tito\u2019s Handmade Vodka, for spiking (optional)", "Celery ribs, pimento-stuffed olives and lemon wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together all the bloody Mary mix ingredients, transfer to a bottle and shake well just before using."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill tall glasses with ice; pour the bloody Mary mix on top."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using the vodka, mix 1/4 cup vodka with 1/2 cup bloody Mary mix in a shaker over ice; shake for 10 hard strokes, strain and pour into each ice-filled glass."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Garnish with a leafy interior rib of celery, a wooden skewer of olives and a lemon wedge."}], "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021065-bloody-mary-mix"}
