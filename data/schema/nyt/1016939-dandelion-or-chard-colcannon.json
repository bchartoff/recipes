{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dandelion or Chard Colcannon", "description": "There are two choices here for the greens. Dandelion greens are bitter and chard is not, or only slightly so. I think the potatoes taste particularly sweet against the bitter dandelion greens, but if you don\u2019t want such a profound contrast, use chard. Make sure to remove the stringy stems from the dandelion greens (which, Jennifer McLagan writes in her book \u201cBitter,\u201d is really dandelion chicory and not the wild greens that like to take over your lawn and garden). The dandelion greens will retain their tough texture even when cooked, which also contrasts nicely with the soft, comforting potatoes, but it is a good idea to chop them finely. I don\u2019t peel the potatoes; I like to mash them skins and all. Bunches of either red or green dandelion greens  will work here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/05/health/05recipehealthcolcannon/05recipehealthcolcannon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "About 4 cups, serving 6", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 171, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "378 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed", "Salt to taste", "1 generous bunch dandelion greens or 1 bunch Swiss chard", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium size leek, white and light green parts only, cleaned and chopped", "2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3/4 to 1 cup warm or hot milk", "Freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place potatoes in a saucepan and cover by an inch with water.
