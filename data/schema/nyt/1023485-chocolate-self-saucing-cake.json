{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Self-Saucing Cake", "description": "This fun and easy recipe takes inspiration from the self-saucing chocolate puddings that are popular in Britain and Australia. The basic composition is a simple chocolate cake batter topped with a sauce made from sugar, cocoa powder and hot water. While the cake bakes, the sauce magically works its way down to the bottom of the pan, so you have moist chocolate cake on top and gooey sauce on the bottom. Some recipes make a dense and fudgy cake, but this one is a bit lighter, resulting in a fluffy cake with lots of chocolate sauce to spoon over the top. Serve the cake warm, scooped from the pan, with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, if you like. This is best served the day that it is made. The cake will absorb the sauce as it sits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/07/dining/ya-chocolate-self-saucing-cake-rex/merlin_213671178_432731e2-30c1-47b6-98a2-7a0763ebdf69-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "chocolate cake, dutch-processed cocoa powder, sour cream, halloween, valentine\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1339}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "2/3 cup/60 grams Dutch-process cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus a pinch for the sauce", "3/4 cup/173 grams sour cream, at room temperature", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 cup boiling water", "Ice cream or whipped cream (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "With a rack set in the center, heat the oven to 350 degrees.
