{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Outdoor Porchetta", "description": "Porchetta is a popular Italian street food: juicy, aromatic slices of roast pork and pork cracklings stuffed into bread to make a sandwich. It's often done with a whole pig, but you can make your own porchetta for a crowd with a whole boneless pork shoulder. Here is a great way to do that in summer, or when the cut is too large for your roasting pan. You can order a shoulder from any butcher with a day or two of advance notice, or adapt the recipe for smaller pieces; any meaty roast with skin or a good layer of fat on the outside will work. The meat goes well with the unsalted bread that is typical in Umbria, where porchetta is a specialty.
