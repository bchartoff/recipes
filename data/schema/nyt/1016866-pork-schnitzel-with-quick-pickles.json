{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Schnitzel With Quick Pickles", "description": "When most people think of schnitzel, they default to veal. But pork has its merits. Pork schnitzel is not only more economical than veal, it\u2019s also richer in flavor and easier to cook (you\u2019ve got a bigger margin of error when it comes to timing because pork isn\u2019t as apt to dry out). This recipe calls for panko, which are fluffy Japanese-style bread crumbs that make the coating particularly light. But any bread crumbs will work. If you don\u2019t want to make the quick pickles, serve this with a sliced up cucumber or two and/or fennel bulb with some lime wedges on the side. And if you happen to have lingonberry jam on hand, this is a great time to use it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/10/multimedia/clark-schnitzel/clark-schnitzel-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "austrian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "cucumber, panko, pork, scallion, shallot, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 664}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 602, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1303 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 limes", "3 small Kirby cucumbers or 1 large cucumber, peeled if you like and thinly sliced", "1/3 cup very thinly sliced fennel bulb (save the fronds for garnish)", "1 large shallot or 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup flour", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne", "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "2 eggs, beaten", "1 1/2 cups panko or other unseasoned bread crumbs", "1 1/4 pounds boneless pork cutlets, pounded to 1/8-inch thick", "Coarse kosher salt and ground black pepper", "Safflower, peanut or vegetable oil, for frying", "1 scallion, thinly sliced, including greens", "Lingonberry jam, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pickles: Grate the zest from one of the limes and juice them both.
