{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb With Herb Paste and Spinach", "description": "This spring lamb offering is coated with an oil-based paste. The oil serves to give the lamb\u2019s crust a beautiful glossy appearance and helps infuse it with an herbal scent. You first make a pesto-like pur\u00e9e with a little oil, a lot of dill and parsley, a couple of cloves of garlic and a few anchovies. (The anchovies are optional but I believe invaluable.) Rub this herb paste all over the lamb and roast. When the lamb is done, and its flavorful fat has combined with the herbed oil that has run into the bottom of the pan, you use some of this fat to brown some bread crumbs, which become insanely delicious, and then to saut\u00e9 a pile of fresh spinach. Voil\u00e0: a main dish, a side dish and a crunchy garnish, all in one. It\u2019s a meal fit for a celebration, whether religious or secular. \n\nDon't know <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/magazine/100000000773719/carving-lamb.html\">how to carve a lamb</a>?
