(If your tomatoes are tasteless, your pasta will be too, so don\u2019t try this with the off-season grocery store variety.) It\u2019s inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014972-seamus-mullens-pan-con-tomate\">pan con tomate</a>, in which grated tomato and its juices are spooned onto garlic toasts. Here, with vigorous stirring, grated tomato and cold butter form a glossy, light, pretty-in-pink sauce that tastes of sweet, just-cooked tomato. The red-pepper flakes, garlic, basil and Parmesan bring out the flavor of the tomato, and while there are plenty of other ways to embellish further, you don\u2019t need to: This is lazy, easy summer cooking at its best. (P.S. Leftovers make a great room-temperature pasta salad.)\n\n\nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/10/dining/as-tomato-butter-pasta/merlin_192901398_930895d7-0ff3-4422-b8e4-41cde49d7937-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastas, main course", "keywords": "butter, pasta, tomato, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1714}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 pound wavy or ridged pasta (like cavatappi or rigatoni), or a long noodle (like fettuccine)", "2 pounds large, ripe tomatoes (about 2 to 3), halved horizontally", "4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter", "1 large garlic clove, peeled", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "Black pepper", "Torn basil leaves, for serving (optional)", "Finely grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
