The beans are simple to cook and fairly effortless, so do resist the urge to stir too often. Allow them to sit, caramelize and shrivel to bring out all of their natural sweetness. Anchovies are tossed in at the end for a bright, salty hit that complements the sweet beans and shallots. These beans can be made ahead, and are equally delicious warm or at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/01/dining/kc-charred-string-beans/merlin_188545125_ec43078b-02d3-40cc-88f2-1bdb1dc51c3b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "anchovies, green beans, olive oil, shallot", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 347}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large shallot, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 pound green beans, trimmed and patted dry", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 anchovies, minced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium.
