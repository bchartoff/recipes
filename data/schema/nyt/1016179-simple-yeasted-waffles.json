{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Simple Yeasted Waffles", "description": "Yeast-risen waffles have a lovely, complex tang that works beautifully with whatever sweet topping you apply \u2013 honey, maple syrup, fruit jam. You can make the batter the night before and let it rise in the refrigerator until breakfast time. Or, it will rise at room temperature in a couple of hours, which makes these waffles a good choice for brunch. Like all waffles, these freeze well. Once they cool, pack them in a heavy-duty freezer bag and store in the freezer. Then pop them, still frozen, in a toaster to reheat. Toasted waffles are even crisper than freshly made ones, and make a quick and convenient weekday breakfast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/02APPE3/02APPE3-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 waffles", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 671}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 290, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "291 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups milk", "1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus more for the waffle iron", "15 grams sugar (1 tablespoon)", "5 grams salt (1 teaspoon)", "1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)", "240 grams all-purpose flour (2 cups)", "90 grams whole wheat flour (3/4 cup), or use all-purpose flour", "2 large eggs", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk and butter until melted and hot but not simmering.
