{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Tomato Salad", "description": "Green tomatoes are either nearly impossible to find or in such abundance that farmers at the greenmarket almost give them away. This recipe was inspired by Rachael Ray, who gets green tomatoes from a wholesaler when they\u2019re scarce or has a favorite farmer at the Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan set some aside during the late spring and early summer when they\u2019re abundant. You can adjust the amount of peppers to control the heat. And red tomatoes work fine if you can\u2019t find green ones.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/dining/09rayrex3/09rayrex3-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings", "keywords": "green tomato, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 51}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 114, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "334 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large green tomatoes, cored, quartered and thinly sliced lengthwise", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 Persian cucumber or 1/3 seedless English cucumber, thinly sliced", "1/2 medium white onion, thinly sliced", "A fat handful each of parsley and mint, chopped", "1 to 2 green chiles, such as serrano or jalape\u00f1o, seeded and thinly sliced or finely chopped", "Juice of 1 lime", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place tomatoes in a large mixing bowl and toss with the salt.
