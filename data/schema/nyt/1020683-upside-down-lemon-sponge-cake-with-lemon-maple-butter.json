This one is made even more special with the charred lemon slices, which give it just the right amount of sharpness to cut through all the sweetness. Be sure to take the butter for the cake out of the refrigerator well in advance, as it needs to be fully softened at room temperature before you make the batter. This cake also reheats quite well; just give it a quick steam to warm through or pop individual portions into the microwave in a sealed, heat-proof bowl.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/18/dining/13Ottorex1/merlin_165659580_9acb122f-39d8-4b9f-923c-31f3514b12f4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, custards and puddings", "keywords": "brown sugar, butter, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, lemon, maple syrup, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 286}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 medium lemons", "1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons/165 milliliters maple syrup", "1 vanilla bean (pod)", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose (plain) flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), cut into small cubes and at room temperature", "3 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk", "1 packed cup/220 grams soft light brown sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whole milk", "1 cup/240 grams cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving", "3 tablespoons/45 milliliters lemon juice\u00a0(from 1 to 2 lemons)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters maple syrup", "7 tablespoons/100 grams unsalted butter, cut into small cubes and refrigerated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit/160 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the 3 lemons, slicing and discarding the tips, then cut each lemon into very thin (1/10-inch/1/4-centimeter-thick) rounds to get 24 slices; discard the seeds (pips).
