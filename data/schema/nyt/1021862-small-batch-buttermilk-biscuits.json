{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Small-Batch Buttermilk Biscuits", "description": "Here\u2019s a recipe for when you want towering, fluffy biscuits, but don\u2019t want a large batch. You can use pretty much any ovenproof dish \u2014 a baking sheet, a square or round cake pan, or even a skillet \u2014 but be sure to butter the pan beforehand. If you like things a little less seasoned, reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, and if you use salted butter in the dough, reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. Fun tip: Bake these beauties in the toaster oven by following the same temperature and timing guidance as you would when baking in a standard oven. Serve them warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/04/dining/ejm-small-batch-biscuits/merlin_183224058_10f8ef92-f5c4-43ef-b70f-28a4568d8e22-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 biscuits", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick breads, side dish", "keywords": "butter, buttermilk, flour, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1055}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, plus room temperature butter for greasing the pan", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters cold buttermilk, plus more as needed", "1 large egg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt to combine.
