{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Scalloped Potato Gratin", "description": "Is there anything better than a molten, golden-topped potato gratin? I don\u2019t think so, either. This one stays fairly classic \u2014 scented with sage, garlic and nutmeg, then showered with lots of nutty Gruy\u00e8re. My tweak is in form rather than flavor. Instead of piling the potatoes an inch or two deep in a gratin dish, I shingle the slices in a shallow sheet pan. It gives the whole thing a more elegant look, and you get maximum browning and crunch on top. There\u2019s less of the gooey center, but what it loses in ooze it makes up for in increased surface area for the crisp-edged baked cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/11/dining/06apperex-gratin/merlin_169778982_31c411f1-f171-4a32-b9b9-dd8d19fe4f4d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "weekday, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "garlic, gruy\u00e8re, potato, sage, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 185}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick), plus more for greasing the aluminum foil, at room temperature", "3 cups heavy cream", "1/4 cup chopped fresh sage leaves", "4 fat garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "5 large eggs", "4 pounds russet potatoes (about 6 large or 8 medium)", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 1/4 cups grated Gruy\u00e8re (8 1/2 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees, and brush 1/4 cup butter on a rimmed 17-by-13-inch baking sheet.
