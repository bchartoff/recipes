{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Chicken With Tomatoes and Corn", "description": "While you could rest grilled chicken on a cutting board to ensure the juices don\u2019t run out of the meat when it\u2019s sliced, a more delicious option is to place the chicken on a pile of tomatoes, corn and red onion. The seasoned drippings act as a no-effort warm dressing, bolstering the flavor of the vegetables and softening their raw edges. Before grilling, the chicken is rubbed with chili powder, the spice mix that typically includes dried oregano, garlic, onion, cumin and ground chiles, for complex flavor with minimal effort. Fresh oregano, while optional, emphasizes the herbs in the chili powder. Use this technique of resting grilled proteins on fresh produce for many summer dinners: pork chops on peaches, steak on chopped scallions and ginger, sausages on radicchio and halloumi on citrus.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/05/dining/AS-Grilled-Chicken-With-Tomatoes-and-Corn/AS-Grilled-Chicken-With-Tomatoes-and-Corn-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken thighs, chili powder, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1052}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, patted dry", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the grill grates", "1 tablespoon chili powder", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/2 pounds large ripe tomatoes, thinly sliced", "1 ear of corn, kernels cut from the cob (about 1 cup kernels)", "1 small red onion, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the grill to medium-high.
