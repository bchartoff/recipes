{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Duck Breast With Braised Belgian Endive, Shaved Cauliflower and Green Peppercorns", "description": "Duck breasts are remarkably delicious, easy to cook and almost as tender as beef tenderloin. Once seasoned, the breasts go skin-side down in the pan and stay there for 20 or so minutes while the skin crisps, the fat renders out and the meat gently cooks to a perfect rosy medium. Along the way, you pour off the accruing melted fat every few minutes into a heatproof jar, and when it has cooled, you can save the duck fat in the freezer. It has such a special flavor; it would be a pity to throw it away. We use the duck fat for the best roasted potatoes but also love it for cooking trout and char and salmon fillets, and recommend roasting cauliflower and baby white turnips in it as well, for the most special combination of clean, juicy and luscious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/15/magazine/15eat/15mag-15eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, poultry", "keywords": "belgian endive, cauliflower, duck breast, green peppercorn", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 96}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 146, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "687 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 whole duck breasts, about 7-8 ounces each (4 halves)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 heads Belgian endive, trimmed", "1 tablespoon green peppercorns, in brine", "2 cups shaved cauliflower \u201cpebbles\u201d", "1 large shallot, finely minced", "1 cup chicken broth or stock", "1/4 - 1/2 cup dry sherry or dry vermouth", "Splash of sherry vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Split and trim the duck breasts to yield 4 individual breasts.
