{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Pomegranate-Glazed Chicken With Tomato Salad", "description": "Of all the condiments in my overstuffed pantry, pomegranate molasses ranks among the most intense. A Middle Eastern staple, it is made from pomegranate juice simmered until nearly as thick and dark as espresso, but with even more punch. Both pickle-sour and syrupy sweet, it\u2019s as pungent as chile paste but with the vivid bristle of tart red fruit instead of capsicum heat. In Middle Eastern cuisine, pomegranate molasses is usually tossed into salads, stirred into stews and sprinkled on vegetables and fish. In my kitchen, I especially adore it as a way to perk up mild meats like chicken. A small drizzle after you\u2019re done grilling the meat can add just the right note of sweet-tart complexity to make everything shine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/Grilled-Pomegranate-Glazed-Chicken/Grilled-Pomegranate-Glazed-Chicken--articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, chicken thigh, pomegranate molasses, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 264}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 947, "unsaturatedFatContent": "47 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "71 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "58 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1098 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons ground cumin", "Kosher salt", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "Black pepper", "Large pinch cayenne", "3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 8)", "4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "10 thyme branches", "7 large garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons, plus 2 teaspoons pomegranate molasses", "1 pint Sungold cherry tomatoes", "10 fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces if large"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, paprika, allspice, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and cayenne.
