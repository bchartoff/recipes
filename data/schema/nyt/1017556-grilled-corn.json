You can strip the husks partly off, remove the silks and re-wrap the ears, then grill. You can soak the corn in cool water before grilling. Or blanch it in hot. I blanch, occasionally following the lead of the celebrity chef Bobby Flay, who adds a cup of milk to his blanching liquid. \u201cI have no idea why I do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like adding corks to the liquid when you\u2019re poaching octopus. Who knows if it works? But it\u2019s a foolproof way to get perfect corn.\u201d Serve with butter, as in this recipe, or dab with mayonnaise and sprinkle with cotija cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/dining/15CORN/15CORN-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, vegetables", "keywords": "corn, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 212}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 169, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "264 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 ears fresh corn", "1 cup whole milk, optional", "1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature", "Kosher salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a fire in your grill, leaving one side free of coals.
