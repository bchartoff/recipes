{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thai Rice Soup With Pork-Cilantro Meatballs", "description": "Jok, also called congee, is a rice porridge that\u2019s like the oatmeal of Asia -- a soft, soothing, filling breakfast that can be sparked with add-ins and toppings for flavor and crunch. Before dawn in Bangkok, jok vendors begin the battle to make the juiciest meatballs, the tiniest ginger matchsticks and the liveliest pickled fresh chiles. This recipe, which also makes a great lunch on a chilly weekend morning, is adapted from two cooks: Leela Punyaratabandhu, author of Simple Thai Food, who makes a vendor-style, puddingy jok; and Chrissy Teigen, the Thai-American supermodel, who makes a simpler version, adapted from her mother Vilaluck\u2019s home recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/16/dining/16SUPERMODEL_CONGEE/16SUPERMODEL_CONGEE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "cilantro, oyster", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 494}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 305, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "390 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large cloves garlic, peeled", "2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro roots or stems", "1/2 teaspoon white peppercorns", "1 pound ground pork", "1 tablespoon oyster sauce", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1 cup jasmine or long-grain rice", "6 cups light chicken stock (see note)", "6 to 8 eggs, optional", "Red chile powder (preferably Thai, but ancho or Aleppo will do)", "1  2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks", "2 scallions, white and green parts, finely chopped", "1/4 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves", "Fish sauce and sriracha, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the meat mixture:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pound or grind the garlic, cilantro and white pepper together into a coarse paste.

Dust  each bowl with chile powder and sprinkle with ginger, scallions and cilantro. Serve immediately, passing fish sauce and sriracha at the table.
