Although we could have used a food mill, we pureed the vegetables in a food processor. If you puree potato only in this manner it will get ''cordy'' but, with the addition of the vegetable cooking liquid and the carrots, the mixture takes on a creamy though slightly chunky consistency, with pieces of potato and carrot still visible throughout.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacques Pepin"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "Six servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "carrot, potato, side dish, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 216, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "562 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds boiling potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces", "1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1/4 cup heavy cream", "2 tablespoons butter", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the potatoes and carrots in a saucepan and cover with cool water.
