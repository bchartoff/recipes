Instead of the usual chocolate cake filled with ganache, she bakes a fragrant lightly spiced sponge cake and fills it with pecan cream cheese filling, while billowing marshmallow frosting evokes a snowdrift. It\u2019s a project to make and can take the better part of a day. Or split it up and make the components over a few days. Either way it\u2019s time well spent. There\u2019s no holiday dessert more spectacular than this.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/01/multimedia/clark-buche-de-noel/clark-buche-de-noel-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cream cheese, pecans, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 277}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 468, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "184 milligrams", "sugarContent": "38 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/120 grams pecan halves or pieces", "1/3 cup/70 grams granulated sugar", "4 tablespoons/60 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled, more for buttering parchment", "3/4 cup/100 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/30 grams cornstarch, sifted", "3/4 teaspoon/4 grams ground cinnamon", "3/4 teaspoon/4 grams ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon/1 gram fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon/1 gram black pepper", "6 large eggs", "3/4 cup/150 grams packed light brown sugar", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting and rolling", "8 ounces/225 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "8 tablespoons/115 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams ground cinnamon", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters egg whites (from about 4 large eggs)", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon/3 grams cream of tartar", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the praline:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and place a rack in center.
