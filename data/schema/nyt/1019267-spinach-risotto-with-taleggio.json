{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach Risotto With Taleggio", "description": "This recipe, based on the nettle risotto from River Caf\u00e9 in London, substitutes spinach, which is easier to find and less perilous to work with. It\u2019s best made with mature, crinkly spinach, which has a more robustly mineral flavor than delicate baby leaves, but use whichever you can get. The melting taleggio makes the rice supremely creamy, and adds a funky earthiness. Note that it\u2019s easiest to remove the rind and cut the cheese into cubes when it\u2019s straight-from-the-fridge cold, then let it come to room temperature as you cook the rice. If you'd like to use an equal quantity of nettles here instead of spinach, you can.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/18/dining/18apperex/merlin_136610415_37ba3a16-85bb-4223-8769-46d84e1010fb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, grains and rice", "keywords": "arborio rice, spinach, taleggio cheese, main course, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 810}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 496, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "901 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces cold taleggio", "10 ounces/8 packed cups spinach,\u00a0any thick stems removed", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 medium red onion, finely diced", "3 cups finely diced celery", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 1/2 cup Arborio rice", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt, more as needed", "3/4 cup dry white wine", "3 1/2 cups good vegetable or chicken stock"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the rind off the taleggio and discard.
