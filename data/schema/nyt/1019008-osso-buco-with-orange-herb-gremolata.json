The sauce for my rendition is tomato-based, bolstered (subtly) by anchovies as well as white wine and broth. But it\u2019s the addition of orange zest and oil-cured black olives that makes this a standout. Like most slow-cooked dishes, you can make this a few days ahead and it will only be better for the wait. The tradition is to serve the veal (you can use pork, if you prefer) with a last-minute dusting of <em>gremolata,</em> a mix, in this case, of basil, orange zest and garlic. Osso buco is good over rice, noodles or other grains; I like it over mashed potatoes or a smooth squash pur\u00e9e.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/29/magazine/29Paris-recipes3/29Paris-recipes3-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, cured black olives, dry white wine, orange, tomato, veal shank, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 80}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 795, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "100 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1853 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 28-ounce can whole, peeled tomatoes, preferably imported", "3 tablespoons canola oil", "6 cross-cut veal shanks or 12 pork ones, patted dry", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "4 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "2 carrots, thinly sliced", "1 large onion, finely chopped", "3 sprigs thyme, leaves only", "1 bay leaf", "6 anchovy fillets", "1 cup dry white wine", "1 cup chicken broth", "3/4 cup oil-cured black olives, pitted", "4 wide strips orange (or lemon) zest", "Pinch red-pepper flakes", "Rind of 1 orange (or lemon), finely chopped", "1/4 cup basil leaves, finely chopped", "1 clove garlic, finely chopped", "Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "To make the osso buco:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to 350 degrees.
