{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Faux Babbo Ravioli", "description": "One of the singular pleasures of eating out in New York City in the early years of the new century was the arrival of a plate of steaming beef-cheek ravioli at Babbo, Mario Batali's flagship restaurant on Waverly Place in Greenwich Village. The delicate pasta triangles glistened beneath a velvety sauce made of crushed squab liver livened with capers and anchovies.\n\nSo I set out to make the things myself, at home. To do so required a few adjustments, of course. \n\nThe truth is, Italian food demands but does not require the best ingredients and the haughtiest treatment. No cuisine so rooted in poverty ever can. So substitute chicken liver for the squab in the sauce. Substitute brisket for beef cheeks in the filling. As Batali said one day over coffee, you could use anything braised, anything soft.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/26/dining/Faux-Babbo-Ravioli/Faux-Babbo-Ravioli-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 39}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium white onion, chopped", "1 celery stalk, chopped", "1 pound beef brisket cut into 1-inch cubes (or short ribs)", "1 cup red wine, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup chopped fresh or canned tomatoes, plus more as needed", "1 large pinch chopped fresh rosemary", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Pasta dough for ravioli <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9355-pasta-dough-for-ravioli\">(see recipe)</a>", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Chicken livers Toscani <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9356-chicken-livers-toscani\">(see recipe)</a>", "1 handful Italian parsley, chopped", "1/2 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
