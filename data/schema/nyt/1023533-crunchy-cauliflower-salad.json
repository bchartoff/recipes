{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy Cauliflower Salad", "description": "This chopped salad celebrates raw cauliflower, a hearty vegetable often reserved for roasting, which renders it golden and soft. Here, crunchy, thinly sliced cauliflower and radicchio bring a mix of slightly sweet and pleasantly bitter flavors; the honey and Meyer lemon vinaigrette is a nod to winter, when citrus fruits are at their brightest and sweetest. Customize the salad with whatever crunchy vegetables you have on hand; celery, fennel and cabbage all make great candidates. This dish makes the perfect side for roasted fish or chicken, or enjoy the salad as a main dish topped with beans, shredded chicken or canned tuna.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/27/dining/kc-crunchy-winter-salad/merlin_215042805_8ba03ea9-e5b1-4f44-93c1-6c76cf862bba-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cauliflower, honey, meyer lemon, parmesan, quick, radicchio, salad, scallion, walnut, fall, spring, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 231}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "2 teaspoons finely grated fresh Meyer lemon zest, plus 3 tablespoons juice (from 2 Meyer lemons)", "1 teaspoon honey", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound large cauliflower florets, very thinly sliced (about 5 cups, see Tip)", "1 small head radicchio (8 ounces), halved, cored and leaves coarsely torn", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions, plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped roasted walnuts (about 2 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine oil, Meyer lemon zest and juice, and honey.
