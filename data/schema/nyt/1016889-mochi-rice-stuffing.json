{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mochi Rice Stuffing", "description": "Thanksgiving dinner in Hawaii may start with pineapple-Vienna-sausage skewers and litchis stuffed with cream cheese. Later there is turkey and ham, but also Spam fried rice and Filipino lumpia, maybe poke (sashimi salad), laulau (ti-leaf-wrapped meat or fish) and a Molokai sweet potato pie topped with haupia (coconut pudding). It is the crazy-quilt, all-embracing nature of the feast that makes it local-kine \u2014 that is, island-style. \nLara Mui Cowell of Honolulu offers this recipe from her popo (maternal grandmother), Jannie Luke Thom, a second-generation Chinese-American who was born in Hawaii before it became a state. The dish is a Chinese take on Western-style sage stuffing, swapping out bread crumbs for mochi rice and adding lap cheong (Chinese sausage) and char siu (Chinese barbecue pork). But in true Hawaiian style, you may substitute Portuguese sausage \u2014 or even Spam.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19HAWAII/19HAWAII-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "bacon, chinese sausage, mochi rice, shiitake, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 444, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "695 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups mochi rice (also known as glutinous sweet rice or sticky rice), rinsed", "6 large dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked according to package instructions", "1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided", "3 slices bacon, chopped", "2 teaspoons oyster sauce, or soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1 cup diced onion (from 1 onion)", "1/2 cup chopped green onion (from 3 to 4 onions)", "1/2 pound diced lap cheong (Chinese sausage), or use dried sweet sausage such as chorizo or salami", "1/4 pound diced char siu (Chinese barbecue pork), or use sugar-cured ham steak seared on both sides", "1 1/2 cups cooked chestnuts, roughly chopped (store-bought is fine)", "1 cup chopped water chestnuts", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "2 large eggs, beaten", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Cook the rice:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using a rice cooker, combine rice and 2 1/2 cups water in the rice cooker and soak for 1 hour, then cook until tender, about 20 minutes.
