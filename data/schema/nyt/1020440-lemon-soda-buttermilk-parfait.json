{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon-Soda Buttermilk Parfait", "description": "These seriously elegant and tongue-tingling parfaits are an excellent dessert to have in your year-round repertoire and are as perfect in the formal dining room under the chandelier as they are in the backyard tent on picnic tables under the paper streamers. Alternating thin precise layers of lemon soda gelatin and tangy buttermilk gelatin takes patience and focus, but once built, they can sit, covered, up to a week in the refrigerator. Be sure to pull them twenty minutes before serving to allow the fully chilled and set parfaits to relax a little, tempering to a perfectly jiggly consistency \u2014 then try not to giggle as you eat that first zingy lemony spoonful.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/magazine/08mag-eat/08mag-eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "4 parfaits", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "parfaits and trifles, project", "keywords": "buttermilk, club soda, gelatin, lemon, whipped cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 309}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups club soda", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon powdered gelatin", "1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 4 lemons), strained", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/4 cup cold water", "1 1/2 tablespoons powdered gelatin", "1 3/4 cups heavy cream", "1 cup buttermilk", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "Unsweetened whipped cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the lemon gelatin: Pour 1/4 cup club soda into a medium bowl.
