{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffing Panzanella With Cranberry Vinaigrette", "description": "The best way to reheat leftover stuffing? Press it into a pan, cut it into cubes and fry it in oil until crisp. The exterior browns and caramelizes, while the inside remains tender and creamy, just like the best bread pudding. This trick works best with stuffing made from smaller pieces of bread, but even if you don\u2019t end up with perfect cubes, they will still be delicious. Serve them warm, on top of a fresh, raw salad tossed in a tangy cranberry-mustard vinaigrette, with fried pepitas running throughout for even more crunch. If you use a homemade cranberry sauce for the dressing, you may want to sweeten it with a touch of honey.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sohla El-Waylly"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/25/dining/23leftoversrex2/merlin_179865849_4490e58a-65d5-4005-8ff0-c98b602e4799-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, salads and dressings, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "celery, cranberry sauce, fennel, greens, pear, radish, thanksgiving leftover, fall, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 85}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan", "3 cups leftover stuffing", "1/4 cup pepitas (or another seed or chopped nut)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "3 tablespoons homemade, jarred or canned cranberry sauce", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "5 ounces shaved crunchy vegetables, such as radish, fennel, celery, cauliflower or carrot (about 2 lightly packed cups)", "1 medium, ripe pear, halved lengthwise, cored and thinly sliced", "4 ounces assorted crisp-tender greens, such as endive, radicchio, escarole, watercress, arugula, Little Gem or butter lettuce, torn if large (about 6 lightly packed cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start the stuffing croutons: Using olive oil, grease a 9-by-5-inch\u00a0loaf pan, then line it with parchment paper, covering the bottom and 2 long sides with one sheet, creasing into the corners to ensure a snug fit.
