Boil until the turnips and potatoes are very soft, about 30 minutes. Drain the water, leaving the turnips and potatoes in the pot; mash with a potato masher until smooth. (The mixture will be very wet.) Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches the consistency of mashed potatoes, about 40 minutes. Pass the mixture through a sieve into a bowl and stir in the butter. Season with salt and pepper and serve."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10623-turnip-and-potato-puree"}
