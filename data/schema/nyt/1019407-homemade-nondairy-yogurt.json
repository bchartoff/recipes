If you wish to go beyond cashew milk, and use soy milk, coconut milk or your homemade nut milk, our <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/52-how-to-make-yogurt\">How to Make Yogurt guide</a> can help, but whatever you choose, look for nondairy milk with the fewest possible ingredients, ideally just nuts, grains or pulses, and water. While not strictly necessary, the starch used here makes for a creamy, silky yogurt that\u2019s still loose enough to stir. If you prefer a thicker yogurt, add a little more, or try the agar powder variation. Or leave the thickener out entirely for a thin, pourable yogurt that\u2019s perfect for smoothies.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/dining/18YOGURT9/18YOGURT9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 quart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, snack, one pot, project", "keywords": "gluten-free, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 26, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "70 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups cashew milk", "3 to 4 tablespoons cornstarch or arrowroot powder", "2 tablespoons yogurt with active live cultures or 1 probiotic capsule"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place 3/4 cup milk in a small bowl and whisk in starch until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring remaining milk to a simmer in a medium pot.
