{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Chicken With Maple Butter and Rosemary", "description": "This simple roast chicken combines the classic fall flavors of maple and rosemary with melted butter, which is basted over the bird as it cooks to keep it juicy. The butter browns slightly and helps caramelize the outside thanks to the sugars in the maple syrup. The result is a fragrant, sweet-and-salty chicken that makes the house smell great. There will be plenty of buttery pan juices left over, which you should most certainly pass around the table, but they would also be delicious spooned over rice pilaf.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/12/dining/ch-maple-roast-chicken-horizontal/ch-maple-roast-chicken-horizontal-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "butter, chicken, maple syrup, rosemary, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1472}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 716, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "990 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 1/2-pound) whole chicken", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 to 3 rosemary sprigs, plus 2 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped rosemary", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons maple syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
