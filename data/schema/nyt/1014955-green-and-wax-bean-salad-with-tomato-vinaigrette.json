{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green and Wax Bean Salad With Tomato Vinaigrette", "description": "This recipe calls for using past-their-prime tomatoes to make a vinaigrette by halving them across their equators, scooping out the seeds and grating the flesh on the large holes of a box grater. Seasoned with salt, vinegar and olive oil, it makes an flavorful dressing. Here, it's tossed with green and wax beans, sliced kalamata olives and torn basil leaves for a summer salad that's delicious cold or at room temperature. The vinaigrette can also be used as a crostini topping with white anchovies and fried capers, or in the base of an agrodolce to serve with fish or chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/06/dining/video-clark-greenbean/video-clark-greenbean-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "green beans, tomato, wax beans, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 76}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 172, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "182 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound green beans, trimmed", "1/2 pound yellow wax beans, trimmed", "1 overripe large tomato", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, or to taste", "1/4 teaspoon kosher sea salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1/4 cup thinly sliced pitted kalamata olives", "1/3 cup torn fresh basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
