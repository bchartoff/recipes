{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fall Salad With Apples, Cheddar and Crispy Sage", "description": "Bubbling sage leaves in olive oil until sizzling provides crisp thrills in this simple, flavorful combination of salty cheese and sweet apples, while the resulting sage-scented oil melds with honey and lemon to create a herbaceous dressing. Mild, leafy butter lettuce helps tie it all together, but slightly bitter chicories like fris\u00e9e, escarole or endive would work well, too.
