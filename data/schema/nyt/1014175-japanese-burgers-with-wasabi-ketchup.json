Perfection.\u201d Mrs. Jammet agreed. \u201cThe ros\u00e9 has a little more fruit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt picks up the sweet from the ketchup, while the bubbles and acidity cut through the fat of the meat.\u201d So there you have your wine pairing, if you\u2019re interested. The burger goes beautifully with beer as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/japanese-burgers-wasabi-ketchup/japanese-burgers-wasabi-ketchup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "ground pork, ground sirloin, wasabi, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 128}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 399, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "988 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup ketchup", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon wasabi paste", "1/2 cup panko or other dry bread crumbs", "1/4 cup whole milk", "8 ounces ground sirloin", "8 ounces ground pork", "1/4 cup finely chopped white onion", "1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon pepper", "Sesame oil, for coating hands", "4 brioche buns, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the wasabi ketchup", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the wasabi ketchup: Whisk together the ketchup, soy sauce and wasabi paste."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the burgers: Prepare a grill for medium heat.
