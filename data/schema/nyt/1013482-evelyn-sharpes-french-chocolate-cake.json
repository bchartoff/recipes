{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Evelyn Sharpe's French Chocolate Cake", "description": "Just as there will always be a place in the world for an understated but luxurious black dress, there will always be a place for flourless chocolate cake. This recipe from 1969 was one of the first published, long before the cake became fashionable. Today it may be a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s a swanky one. This cake is dense, but not the solid block of sweet that can make you wonder if you\u2019re just eating chocolate ganache in cake form. Of course, since the recipe has so few ingredients, it is imperative to use truly delicious chocolate. The proportion of cacao, in case you\u2019re wondering, should fall between 60 and 70 percent.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/dining/cake/cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 612}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound semisweet chocolate", "10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour (or matzo meal)", "1 tablespoon sugar", "4 eggs, separated", "Sweetened whipped cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
