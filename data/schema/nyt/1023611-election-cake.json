Marion Burros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/02/garden/de-gustibus-election-cake-noble-tradition.html\">wrote about the cake in 1988</a>, explaining how it was traditionally made in preparation for Election Day and filled with dried fruit soaked in brandy to ensure that it would last for a couple of days and improve in flavor over time. This version uses raisins and cranberries, but currants, dates, dried apricots, prunes or even dried pears all work great. Nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and clove infuse the cake with warmth and their scent wafts through the kitchen as the cake bakes. Brushing a coat of glaze onto the cake while it\u2019s still warm softens the crust and soaks it with a lemony brightness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/28/dining/YK-election-cake/merlin_215480784_e331b7cc-e516-4cc2-8c6b-c7456d1278c7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "active dry yeast, allspice, brandy, bundt cake, clove, dried cranberry, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, make-ahead, nutmeg, plan-ahead, raisin, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 321}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons/114 grams unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan", "4 cups/527 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/190 grams packed dark brown sugar", "1 cup/230 milliliters whole milk", "2 (1/4-ounce) envelopes active dry yeast (4 1/2 teaspoons)", "1 lemon", "2 large eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1 teaspoon coarse Kosher or sea salt", "2 1/2 tablespoons brandy", "2/3 cup/95 grams packed raisins", "1/2 cup/67 grams dried unsweetened cranberries", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon ground clove", "2 cups/242 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Generously butter a 10-inch bundt pan.
