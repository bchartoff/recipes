Fresh rosemary needles are pressed into the fillets, which are seasoned in flour and pan fried for a crisp exterior and flaky inside. A sauce built on shallots, white wine and lemon adds complexity. Pair it with a light vegetable like saut\u00e9ed asparagus, or a bright arugula salad, and serve with some of that white wine for an easy, refreshing spring dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/13/dining/13TROUT/13TROUT-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, times classics", "keywords": "capers, rosemary, trout, dairy-free, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 479}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 240, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "388 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary", "4 trout fillets", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 shallots, peeled and minced", "1 cup white wine", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 tablespoon drained capers"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Press 1/2 teaspoon of the rosemary needles into the flesh of each trout fillet.
