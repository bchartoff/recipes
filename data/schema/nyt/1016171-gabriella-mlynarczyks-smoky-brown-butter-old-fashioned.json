Put the butter in a heavy-bottomed pan, and set over a medium flame to caramelize the milk solids. Once the butter melts, it will start to foam and brown and give off a nutty aroma; there should be some caramelization at the bottom of the pan. The process is quick, so keep an eye on it. Remove from heat, and pour into the jar of bourbon. Screw the lid on tight, and give a good shake. Let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour, then refrigerate it for at least an hour. The butter fat will solidify and rise to the top of the jar. Scoop off the hardened fat, and strain the bourbon through a coffee filter. Store in a refrigerated airtight container, to use for old-fashioneds. (Makes enough for 8 old-fashioneds.)"}]}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "To make the old-fashioned", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the simple syrup, bitters and liquid smoke to a chilled old-fashioned glass, and muddle with a bar spoon.

For intense orange flavor, you can flame the twist."}]}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016171-gabriella-mlynarczyks-smoky-brown-butter-old-fashioned"}
