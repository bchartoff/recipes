{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stew Peas and Spinners", "description": "Jamaican stew peas are ubiquitous to the island nation, and each version is as individual as the person cooking them. Red peas (kidney beans) are mellowed out with coconut milk and stewed alongside beef, pork, chicken or even vegetarian options. Allowing ample time to soak the peas before cooking makes for a streamlined process. And, as ever, your most crucial ingredient will be time. But the more you make this dish, the more it\u2019ll gel alongside your personal preferences: more garlic, less meat, larger peppers or varied herbs. The choices are entirely yours. Spinners, flour dumplings that you roll into ropes between your hands, are essential to making this a full-fledged meal, adding texture and body to the stew.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Bryan Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/09/dining/09EAT-stew-peas-and-spinners/merlin_213915771_9fa45770-c972-4acb-8ec7-1b6913d1c5db-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, beef stew meat, coconut milk, garlic, jamaican, kidney bean, plan ahead, pork", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 219}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups dried red peas (kidney beans)", "2 pounds salted pig\u2019s tail, chopped, or 1 pound beef stew meat (such as chuck), cut into large chunks", "Salt and pepper", "5 garlic cloves, chopped", "3 scallions, chopped", "1 (13- to 14-ounce) can coconut milk (about 1 3/4 cups)", "1 Scotch bonnet or habanero chile", "3 thyme sprigs", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "Cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse your peas, then soak them in a large pot of cold water in the refrigerator overnight or for at least 8 hours.
