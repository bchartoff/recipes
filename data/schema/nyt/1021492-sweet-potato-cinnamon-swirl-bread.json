{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Cinnamon Swirl Bread", "description": "Roasted, pur\u00e9ed sweet potatoes lend moisture, flavor and a rich golden color to this hybrid breakfast bread and pastry. Here, a batter-like layer added to the yeasted dough, referred to as a wine loaf, helps prevent those gaps that often form in swirled breads. This recipe bakes beautifully in a small Pullman loaf pan, but any 1 1/2-pound-capacity loaf pan will do. If you can spare a slice, it makes a beautiful overnight French toast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Laurie Ellen Pellicano"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/dining/lep-sweet-potato-loaf/merlin_176510394_51d02fb2-018a-499e-b237-93917b6cb034-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9- to 10-inch loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, snack, breads, pastries", "keywords": "active dry yeast, bread flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, raisin, sweet potato, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 171}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons warm water", "2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (from a 3/4-ounce packet)", "2 3/4 cups/390 grams bread flour, plus more for kneading", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground mace", "5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing", "1/3 cup/75 grams dark brown sugar", "1 large egg", "3/4 cup/210 grams sweet potato pur\u00e9e (from about 1 large sweet potato; see Tip)", "1 tablespoon heavy cream, half-and-half or milk, for brushing", "1 cup/150 grams golden or dark raisins (or a combination)", "1/3 cup/40 grams bread flour", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for sprinkling", "1 1/2 tablespoons/20 grams unsalted butter, room temperature", "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1 large egg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a small bowl, mix together the warm water and yeast.
