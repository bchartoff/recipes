{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meatloaf Stroganoff", "description": "This meatloaf pays homage to one that was served at the old M. Wells in Long Island City, when the restaurant was in a dodgy old diner where the cooks did prep work on the lunch counters and the vents occasionally caught fire. The chef, Hugue Dufour, folded knuckles of foie gras into this marvelous Stroganoff gravy that he used to nap big loaves of aged-beef meatloaf. I\u2019ve made versions at home with beef and lamb and pork covered in sauce made with mushrooms both wild and supermarket-bland. I\u2019ve spooned canned foie gras into my meatloaf mixture to mimic the original, and I\u2019ve dotted it into the finished sauce as well. That last maneuver was in truth more successful, providing pops of richness against the silkiness of the cream, but I\u2019ve also omitted the foie entirely and no one has been the poorer for it. The adaptations hardly matter. Make a good and juicy meatloaf with the best meat you can find, and cover it with mushrooms and cream. You\u2019ve got a meal to suggest magic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/magazine/17mag-eat-slide-Y0D9/17mag-eat-slide-Y0D9-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, canadian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, casseroles, meat, times classics, vegetables", "keywords": "chicken-liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, cultivated mushrooms, panko bread crumbs, parsley, sour cream, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 453}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 947, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "77 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "38 grams", "sodiumContent": "1167 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large yellow onion, peeled and diced", "1 pound cultivated mushrooms, like button or cremini, cleaned, trimmed and thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "1 cup panko bread crumbs", "1 1/2 pounds ground beef", "1 large egg, beaten", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon tomato paste", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "2 cups chicken stock, homemade or store-bought", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 1/2 cups sour cream", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "4 ounces chicken-liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 or canned cooked foie gras, optional", "3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350.
