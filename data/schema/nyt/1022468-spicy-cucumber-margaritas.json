Some cocktail recipes call for preparing simple syrup on the stovetop, then combining with other ingredients, but this one uses a blender to combine the cucumbers, cilantro, sugar, lime zest and juice as a shortcut. Using delicate, thin-skinned Persian cucumbers ensures a vibrant color, and cilantro adds grassy notes. Because the heat levels of jalape\u00f1os can fluctuate, allow guests to garnish with sliced jalape\u00f1o to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/10/dining/aw-spicy-cucumber-margarita/aw-spicy-cucumber-margarita-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 drinks (1 1/2 cups each)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cilantro, cucumber, jalape\u00f1o, tequila", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 198}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound Persian cucumbers (about 7 cucumbers), roughly chopped", "1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1/3 cup granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated fresh lime zest plus 1/4 cup lime juice (from about 3 limes)", "2 teaspoons minced jalape\u00f1o, plus more diagonal slices for garnish", "Sea salt, as needed", "6 to 8 ounces white tequila, depending on preferred strength", "Ice, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a high-speed blender, blend the cucumbers, cilantro, sugar, lime zest, lime juice and minced jalape\u00f1o until mixture is foamy and blended.
