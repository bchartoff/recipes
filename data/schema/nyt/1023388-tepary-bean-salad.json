{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tepary Bean Salad", "description": "Indigenous communities in the Sonoran Desert have cultivated the tiny, drought-tolerant tepary bean for millennia. This recipe, adapted from \u201cFrom I\u2019Itoi\u2019s Garden: Tohono O\u2019odham Food Traditions\u201d by Tohono O\u2019odham Community Action (TOCA), a grassroots food and health community organization, reimagines a traditional tepary bean dish by adding venerable corn, colorful peppers and rich aromatics. The white beans have a sweet finish, while the brown variety showcases an uncommon nuttiness. Navy or Great Northern beans may be substituted for the white tepary beans, but there is no equivalent for the unparalleled tepary brown. Combined with an assertive cumin vinaigrette, this robust salad manifests a rich blend of old and new indigenous foodways.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kevin Noble Maillard"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/31/dining/31GARDENSrex1-1/merlin_211376499_8d1dc80e-a5b6-48ac-8485-2d08610fc49b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, beans, side dish", "keywords": "corn, ground cumin, make-ahead, salad, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 54}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup apple cider vinegar", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon minced garlic", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup cooked, drained white tepary beans, or Great Northern or navy beans (see Tip)", "1 cup cooked, drained brown tepary beans (see Tip)", "1 cup chopped red onion or scallions", "1 cup cooked corn kernels", "1 cup diced bell peppers (preferably a combination of red, orange and yellow)", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 jalape\u00f1o, diced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the vinaigrette: In a large bowl, combine vinegar, mustard, cumin, garlic and \u00bd teaspoon each salt and pepper; whisk to combine.
