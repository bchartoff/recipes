Elegant and savory, they are as good for a midnight supper as they are for brunch. Though the recipe is a bit complex, it can be parceled out into a series of small, manageable chores; both the pancakes and filling can be prepared up to 2 days ahead, and once the blintzes are assembled, they can wait in the fridge as well. The final step of browning and crisping the blintzes in butter is almost no work at all.
