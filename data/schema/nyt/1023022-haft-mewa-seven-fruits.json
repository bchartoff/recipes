{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Haft Mewa (Seven Fruits)", "description": "Haft mewa, which means seven fruits in Persian, is a symbolic compote of dried fruits and nuts traditionally prepared for Afghan Nowruz, the celebration of the new year and vernal equinox. Durkhania Ayubi shared this version in her cookbook, \u201cParwana: Recipes and Stories From an Afghan Kitchen.\u201d She received the recipe from her mother, Farida Ayubi, who grew up making it in Afghanistan and continued the tradition with her family in their adopted home of Adelaide, Australia. Different types of nuts and fruits, which sometimes number more than seven despite the dish\u2019s name, are soaked in water for two days to allow the fruits to plump up and release their natural juices. The nuts are peeled so they don\u2019t make the syrup bitter and murky.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/16/dining/16nowrozrex3/merlin_203116035_02cb79a4-ae87-4091-ae28-afe7a207b9e8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P2DT9H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "almond, dried apricots, nowruz, pistachio, walnut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/50 grams whole raw almonds", "6 tablespoons/50 grams shelled raw pistachios", "1/2 cup/50 grams walnut halves (optional; see Tip)", "1 cup/150 grams golden raisins, rinsed", "1/3 cup/50 grams dried large apricots, about 8, rinsed", "1/3 cup/50 grams black raisins, rinsed", "1/3 cup/50 grams senjed (oleaster), about 25, rinsed (see Tip)", "1/4 cup/50 grams whole dried sour apricots with seeds, about 10, rinsed (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 3 cups of water to a boil.
