{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rawia Bishara\u2019s Brussels Sprouts With Tahini Sauce", "description": "This recipe is a mashup from Rawia Bishara, who has gradually adapted the home cooking of her childhood in Nazareth to the tastes of Brooklynites at her restaurant, Tanoreen. She'd never cooked Brussels sprouts before she arrived forty years ago, and she said that at first, deep-fried was the only way her children would eat them. We modern cooks may prefer roasting for a weeknight dinner, but the golden, crisp fried version should be experienced at least once. <br/><br/>\nSesame is one of the most universal flavors of the Middle East, and the base for many of its staples: tahini (sesame paste), hummus, halvah, and the spice mix called za'atar. But straight tahini sauce, with sesame, garlic, and lemon juice, comes on a little strong. The sweet sharpness of pomegranate molasses provides a counterpoint to the rich sesame, and yogurt lightens the mixture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/24/multimedia/me-culinary-tanoreen/me-culinary-tanoreen-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, side dish", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, pomegranate molasses, tahini, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 359}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 551, "unsaturatedFatContent": "38 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "165 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup tahini (Middle Eastern sesame paste)", "2 garlic cloves, crushed or coarsely chopped", "1/3 to 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from about 3 lemons)", "1/3 teaspoon salt, more to taste", "1 cup low-fat plain yogurt", "2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses", "Corn oil for frying or roasting", "3 to 4 pounds brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs)", "Lemon wedges and chopped parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a food processor or blender, combine the tahini, garlic, 1/3 cup lemon juice and 1/3 teaspoon salt.
