{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso Fish Chowder\u00a0", "description": "This twist on New England clam chowder features a lighter broth that gets its depth from caramelized miso and smoky bacon, and its briny seafood flavor from bottled clam juice. New potatoes are in season during summer months and have tender, thin skins, but peeled Yukon Golds are a great alternative. To ensure flaky, tender fish, it is gently poached in the broth during the last five minutes of cooking. For a meatless chowder, simply omit the bacon and add a few pinches of smoked paprika in its place.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/25/dining/kc-miso-cod-chowder/merlin_208558617_7878bcbf-1619-41e1-994f-60b21335cf1b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "cod, fish, miso", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 805}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "4 ounces bacon (3 to 4 slices), sliced crosswise into \u00bc-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 leek, white and light green parts, thinly sliced crosswise", "1 celery stalk, diced", "Salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup white miso", "2 (8-ounce) bottles clam juice", "1 pound small new potatoes, quartered", "1 thyme sprig\u00a0", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions", "1 1/2 pounds center-cut cod, or other flaky white fish, cut into 1 \u00bd-inch chunks", "Crusty bread or oyster crackers, for serving\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium.
