{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn Salad With Tomatoes, Basil and Cilantro", "description": "High summer produce comes together in this simple mix, tangy with lime juice and full of fresh herbs. Even in the height of the season, corn gets a touch sweeter when heated, and the easiest way to do it is in the microwave. It takes just a few minutes to zap the corn cobs in their husks, which makes them easy to shuck. The silks will slip right off the sweeter and still-crisp corn. Picking basil and cilantro leaves by hand then tearing them right over the salad keeps their delicate fragrance intact. Serve this with anything off the grill or alongside tacos or sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/GK-Tomato-Corn-With-Basil-15SALADREX/merlin_209703621_3ca447ea-ea9e-4814-bc53-791234bd080f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "basil, cherry tomatoes, cilantro, corn, haba\u00f1ero, lime, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1419}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ears of corn", "1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, halved", "1 lime", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt", "1/4 teaspoon minced seeded fresh habanero or other very hot chile (optional)", "1/2 cup fresh basil leaves", "1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Microwave the corn in their husks on high for 3 minutes.
