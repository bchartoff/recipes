While you can use any cut of boneless steak in this recipe (which is adapted from Kate Kavanaugh, the owner of Western Daughters Butcher Shoppe in Denver), bavette steak, also called flap meat or sirloin tip, is a particularly flavorful and tender choice. Ms. Kavanaugh likes to serve it alongside a crunchy vegetable salad that is layered with thinly sliced strawberries and tart rhubarb and tossed with a lime-tahini dressing, but any tangy salad will work well with the richness of the meat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/07/dining/06butcherrex1/merlin_158598249_85b3752c-d97c-4da3-a29d-8277d95a3699-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, salads and dressings, steaks and chops, vegetables", "keywords": "basil, flank steak, ghee, mint, radish, rhubarb, steak, strawberries, tahini, turnip, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 55}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds bavette steak (sometimes called flap meat or sirloin tip) or flank steak, preferably grass-fed and finished", "Flaky sea salt, as needed", "2 tablespoons ghee, tallow or neutral oil", "2 tablespoons tahini, preferably raw", "Finely grated zest of 1/2 lime plus juice of 2 limes", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon cold water", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "10 to 12 medium-firm strawberries, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)", "1 1/4 cups thinly sliced rhubarb (about 1 stalk) or peeled carrots", "1 medium cucumber, thinly sliced into rounds (about 1 1/2 cups)", "3 hakurei or other small sweet turnips, thinly sliced into rounds (about 3/4 cup)", "3 medium radishes, thinly sliced into rounds (about 3/4 cup)", "1 quart mixed tender greens", "2/3 cup packed coarsely chopped mint", "1/2 cup packed chopped basil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pull the steak out of the fridge 1 hour before cooking to come to room temperature.
