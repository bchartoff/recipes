{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon Soba Noodles With Ponzu-Scallion Sauce", "description": "Quick-cooking, earthy soba noodles, made entirely from buckwheat or a combination of buckwheat and wheat flour, are perfect for easy weeknight dinners and can be enjoyed either chilled or in warm dishes. In this speedy noodle soup, dashi powder \u2014 an instant soup stock made from dried powdered bonito (skipjack tuna) that functions similarly to bouillon cubes \u2014 and subtly sweet cabbage help create a flavorful broth quickly. Salmon is thinly sliced and poached in the broth just before serving. A tangy and vibrant ponzu-scallion sauce balances the rich fatty fish, while grated daikon adds freshness, texture and a subtle bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/06/dining/kc-salmon-soba-noodles/kc-salmon-soba-noodles-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "cabbage, dashi, salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 704}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces Napa cabbage, chopped into 1-inch pieces (3 packed cups)", "2 tablespoons instant dashi powder (such as Hondashi, see Tip)", "Salt and black pepper", "12 ounces dry soba noodles", "1 cup thinly sliced scallions", "3 tablespoons ponzu", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola oil", "1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger", "8 ounces firm tofu, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "1 pound center-cut skinless salmon fillet, halved down the center and each piece sliced crosswise \u00bc-inch thick", "8 ounces daikon, peeled and finely grated (1 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, combine cabbage, dashi powder and 8 cups of water, and bring to boil over high heat.
