As with most of the bar\u2019s cocktails, it requires a little labor, but the pink peppercorn-infused cider syrup is easier to make than it looks. The bartender and owner, Sullivan Doh, called the cocktail \u201cfresh and thirst-quenching\u201d and \u201can interesting drink for hot days.\u201d It delivers a riot of fruit flavors from the two layers of apple (the Calvados and the cider), the lemon juice and various fruit notes lurking in the French aperitif Byrrh. Think of it as the kind of julep you might drink on Bastille Day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/13/dining/13FRENCH3/13FRENCH3-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "for one, quick", "keywords": "calvados, cucumber, hard cider, lemon juice, pink peppercorns", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 6}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon pink peppercorns", "2/3 cup hard cider", "2/3 cup sugar", "2 slices of cucumber, about 1/8 inch", "6 to 8 mint leaves, plus a sprig for garnish", "1 1/2 ounces Calvados", "1/2 ounce Byrrh aperitif", "2/3 ounce lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the syrup:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Muddle the pink peppercorns in a pot with the hard cider.
