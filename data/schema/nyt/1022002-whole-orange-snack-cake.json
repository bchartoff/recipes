{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole-Orange Snack Cake", "description": "It may strike you as curious, but adding an entire orange to this easy snacking cake, rind and all, imparts a wonderful flavor reminiscent of orange marmalade, pleasantly bitter and sweet. A high-speed blender is the best way to process the orange, but a food processor works too. You want the pur\u00e9e to be as smooth as possible. While the cake bakes, prepare an easy orange glaze. For that step \u2014 or any recipe requiring both orange zest and juice \u2014 be sure to zest your orange before juicing it, as it\u2019s much more difficult the other way around.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/23/dining/sse-whole-orange-snack-cake/sse-whole-orange-snack-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "butter, confectioners' sugar, milk, orange, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1240}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 small navel orange (about 250 grams), ends trimmed, cut into large chunks, and seeds removed, if necessary", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whole milk", "1 1/2 cups/192 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/151 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/77 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated orange zest, plus 3 to 4 teaspoons freshly squeezed orange juice (from 1 orange)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.\u00a0Prepare the pan: Butter an 8-inch square baking pan.
