{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cod With Chanterelles and Parsley Sauce", "description": "Chanterelles are extremely costly, but they are very light, so you get a lot of volume for your dollar. You only need an ounce or two per serving here. This is inspired by a delicious main dish I had at a wonderful fish bistro in Paris, L\u2019Ecailler du Bistrot. There the dish was made with brill, a flat white fish with thick, delicate fillets. Brill is not a fish we find easily in the United States (it is a North Atlantic fish but it lives on the European side). I substituted Alaskan cod, which is not nearly as fine a fish, but the dish is still a winner. Halibut and sea bass will also work.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/02/science/02recipehealth/02recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, kosher, low-carb, low sugar, nut-free, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 95}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "6 to 8 ounces chanterelles, cleaned and coarsely chopped", "1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste), minced", "Salt", "Freshly ground pepper", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "1/2 teaspoon finely chopped or grated lemon zest", "1 1/2 pounds Alaskan cod, halibut or sea bass fillets", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "Lemon juice, to taste", "1 1/3 cups, tightly packed, flat-leaf parsley leaves", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "Salt", "Freshly ground pepper", "Juices from cooked fish, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the parsley sauce.
