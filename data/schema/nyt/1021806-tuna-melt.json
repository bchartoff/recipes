{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tuna Melt", "description": "Legend has it that the tuna melt was accidentally invented in the 1960s at the Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter in Charleston, S.C., when the cook didn\u2019t notice that a bowl of tuna salad had tipped over onto a grilled cheese. We may never know if this story is true, but there\u2019s no doubt that the tuna melt has become a classic American diner food. This recipe adds chopped cornichons and whole-grain mustard for a satisfying crunch and vinegary element. Extra-sharp Cheddar is a must, and as with grilled cheese, the key to achieving perfectly melted cheese and golden bread is to toast the sandwich over medium-low heat. If you prefer an open-face tuna melt, skip the top piece of bread and place the sandwich on a sheet pan under the broiler until the cheese melts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/15/dining/lh-tuna-melt/merlin_181989987_50c9f2af-38a6-45b9-a227-91559073cf7a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "canned tuna, mayonnaise, pickles, sharp cheddar cheese", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1855}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 (6-ounce) cans solid, water-packed tuna, drained", "3/4 cup mayonnaise", "1/4 cup finely chopped cornichons or small kosher dill pickles", "3 tablespoons minced red onion", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 packed tablespoon minced fresh dill (optional)", "2 teaspoons whole-grain mustard", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "8 slices rye or sourdough bread, cut 1/2-inch thick", "8 sandwich slices extra-sharp Cheddar (or 6 ounces shredded)", "4 tablespoons softened unsalted butter, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the tuna in a medium bowl and flake with a fork.
