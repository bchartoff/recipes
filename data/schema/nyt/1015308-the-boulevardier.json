{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Boulevardier", "description": "A marvel of a cocktail with an enviably colorful peerage, the Boulevardier is effectively a cross between a Manhattan and a Negroni. In colder months, it\u2019s a magnificent drink to have as a fallback when you want something richer and more complex than just a whiskey but can never seem to think of what else to order. It\u2019s composed of two parts American whiskey, with one part each of sweet vermouth and Campari. Taken one way, it\u2019s a Manhattan with a portion of Campari swapped in for the regular few drops of Angostura or other aromatic bitters. Seen the other way, it\u2019s a Negroni with whiskey in place of the gin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Toby Cecchini"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/dining/25COOKING-Boulevardier1/25COOKING-Boulevardier1-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy, cocktails", "keywords": "bourbon, campari, rye, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 296}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 115, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": null, "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "1 milligram", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces rye or bourbon", "1 ounces Campari", "1 ounce sweet vermouth (I love a half and half mixture of Cinzano Rosso and Carpano Antica Formula)."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir ingredients together in a mixing glass filled with ice, strain into either a stemmed cocktail glass or a rocks glass with ice, to preference.
