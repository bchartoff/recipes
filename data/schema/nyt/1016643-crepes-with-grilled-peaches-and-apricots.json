{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cr\u00eapes With Grilled Peaches and Apricots", "description": "Heat deepens the flavor of both peaches and apricots, and grilling adds one more seared dimension. The trick here is to grill the fruit just until it colors and softens, but not to let it burn or collapse. I find that 3 minutes on one side is sufficient for peaches, and 2 minutes for apricots, with about 1 minute on the other side.  Cr\u00eapes are easy to make if you use a nonstick cr\u00eape pan, and great to have on hand for desserts like this one. Keep the six extra that this recipe yields in the freezer, and grill some more peaches and apricots next week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/08/science/09recipehealth/09recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dessert, halal, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 36}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 554, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "172 milligrams", "sugarContent": "49 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup / 175 milliliters milk", "1/2 cup /125 milliliters water", "2 large eggs", "1/4 teaspoon / 2 grams salt", "1 tablespoon / 15 grams sugar", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon / 55 grams whole-wheat flour, sifted", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus butter for the pan", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon / 55 grams unbleached all-purpose flour, sifted", "2 1/2 pounds mixed peaches and apricots", "Grape seed oil (or another neutral oil like canola oil) or extra-virgin olive oil as needed, about 2 tablespoons", "1/4 cup mild honey, such as clover", "1 tablespoon butter", "Finely chopped or grated zest of 1 lemon", "Powdered sugar for dusting the cr\u00eapes (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the cr\u00eapes", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place milk, water, eggs and salt in a blender.
