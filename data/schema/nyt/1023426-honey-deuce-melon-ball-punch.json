It\u2019s the official drink of the U.S. Open, the final major tennis tournament of each year. A satisfyingly light cocktail, it tastes like a grown-up pink lemonade, and this version makes a batch large enough to quench the thirsts of a crowd. Store-bought lemonade is bolstered by fresh lemon juice to temper its sweetness, while honeydew melon, scooped to resemble tennis balls, sits atop each glass, serving up an easy way to transport yourself to center court.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vaughn Vreeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/26/dining/vv-honey-deuce/vv-honey-deuce-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "honeydew, lemon, lemonade, raspberry liqueur, vodka", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 45}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 honeydew melon", "3 cups store-bought lemonade", "1 1/2 cups vodka", "1/2 cup raspberry liqueur, such as Chambord", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)", "Ice, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use a melon baller or mini ice cream scoop to scoop the honeydew into balls.
