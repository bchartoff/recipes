I then added some water to the steamer and blanched the greens \u2013 though you could also steam them. Beets take about the same time to steam as they do to roast, and it\u2019s a good option if you don\u2019t want to heat up your kitchen with the oven. But I find that roasted beets have a richer flavor. Here, the flavor of the tahini sauce is so pungent that it doesn\u2019t matter if the beets are muted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/23/science/22recipeforhealthtahini/22recipeforhealthtahini-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 generously", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 173, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "595 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch medium or large beets (3 to 4)", "1 large bunch or 2 smaller bunches beet greens (about 3/4 pound)", "Salt to taste", "1 plump garlic clove, cut in half, green shoot removed", "1/4 cup sesame tahini", "2 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, to taste", "2 to 4 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut greens away from beets, leaving about 1/4 inch of stems.
