{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ham and Cheese Quick Bread", "description": "This is the kind of savory cake that you make once and then play around with for years to come. In this version, there are chopped roasted red peppers, small chunks of ham, some herbs and three cheeses (mozzarella, Parmesan and fontina). The cheeses could be Cheddar and Gruy\u00e8re and a semisoft, easily meltable cheese of your choice. The batter could have chopped Calabrian chiles or pepperoncini (go easy on these hot peppers), a different mix of herbs, scallions or shallots for the chives and pancetta or bacon bits for the meat (or you can skip the meat). Cut the cake into fingers to have with wine or serve it alongside soup or salad. And if it goes a little stale, simply toast it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/14/multimedia/09CAKESREX3-ham-and-cheese-1-70f1/12CAKES-REX3-ham-and-cheese-1-70f1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H5M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack", "keywords": "christmas, thanksgiving, ham, loaf cake, make-ahead, mozzarella, parmesan, roasted red pepper", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 263}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter or nonstick baker\u2019s spray, for the pan", "2 cups/272 grams all-purpose flour\u00a0", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (or to taste)", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 large egg white, at room temperature", "1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature\u00a0", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 tablespoons honey", "4 ounces/115 grams shredded mozzarella, preferably low-moisture (1/2 cup)", "3 ounces/85 grams fontina, cut into small (1/4- to 1/2-inch) cubes (2/3 cup)", "3 ounces/85 grams ham or pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch cubes (1/2 cup)", "2 whole roasted red peppers (about 2 1/2 ounces/70 grams), halved, patted dry and finely chopped", "2/3 ounce/20 grams shredded Parmesan (3 tablespoons), plus more for sprinkling", "3 tablespoons snipped chives\u00a0", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
