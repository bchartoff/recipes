{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Almond Cake With Peaches and Cream", "description": "This tender, golden cake, adapted from Lindsey Shere\u2019s \u201cChez Panisse Desserts,\u201d walks the line between dense and light, with a fine, moist crumb and deep marzipan flavor that comes from a combination of homemade almond paste and a touch of almond extract. Easily made in a food processor, it\u2019s a versatile cake that you can dress up any way you like. Here, it\u2019s topped with peaches and cream, but it\u2019s just as good with berries, nectarines, plums or poached pears. Or leave it plain for a more restrained dessert or afternoon snack. You can vary the nuts for the paste here, too. Substitute unsalted roasted almonds for a toasty, earthy flavor; hazelnuts for woodsy notes; and pistachios plus a dash of orange blossom water for a heady, floral notes. This cake will keep for up to two days well wrapped at room temperature or five days in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/11/dining/06apperex/06apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "almond flour, egg whites, food processor, make-ahead, peach, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1329}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/280 grams softened unsalted butter, plus more for the pan", "1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan", "1 packed cup/125 grams almond flour or sliced, blanched almonds", "1 cup/125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more for serving", "6 large eggs plus 1 egg white, at room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "Sliced peaches, for serving", "Whipped cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or whipped cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
