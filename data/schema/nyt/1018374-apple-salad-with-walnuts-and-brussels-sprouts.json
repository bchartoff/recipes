{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Salad With Walnuts and Brussels Sprouts", "description": "Waldorf salad is definitely in the DNA of this starter from the Publican restaurant in Chicago. Apples and walnuts provide the base, and raw brussels sprouts and kohlrabi take the place of the celery. The dressing, a honeyed vinaigrette made with walnut oil, is lighter than mayonnaise, although the ricotta contributes creaminess. The cured ham on top elevates this to a sophisticated first course, but eliminate it to make the salad vegetarian. Best of all, the salad can be prepared in advance and holds up nicely on a buffet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/09/dining/09PAIR/09PAIR-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, brussels sprouts, honeycrisp apples, kohlrabi, ricotta, walnut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 67}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 280, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "487 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon minced shallot", "1/4 cup apple cider vinegar", "1 teaspoon toasted chile flakes, pulverized in a mortar", "2 tablespoons whole grain mustard", "1 tablespoon honey", "1/4 cup walnut oil", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "3 Honeycrisp or other crisp tart apples, peeled, cored and in 1/2-inch dice", "1/2 medium-size kohlrabi bulb, peeled, in 1/4-inch dice", "12 brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, sliced thin vertically", "1/3 cup shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano", "1/2 cup toasted walnuts", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "Salt and ground black pepper", "6 ounces fresh ricotta", "6 slices serrano ham (about 3 ounces), optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: Combine shallot and vinegar in a small bowl, add chile flakes and beat in mustard and honey.
