One weekend when I had some work to do, I asked my husband to go to the local fish market and pick up one of their marvelous chowders that could be reheated for lunch.  He came home instead with a pound of local bay scallops, the first of the season (and abundant this year).  Now I had to cook.  Fortunately, I had other suitable ingredients on hand and in less than 30 minutes, lunch was on the table.  Not one to let a tasting opportunity go to waste, I figured the dish I almost literally threw together would be compatible with a bottle of simple white Burgundy.  It had just enough richness in the glass.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/bay-scallops-provencal/bay-scallops-provencal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 main-course servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, bay scallops", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 128}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 321, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "661 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh bay scallops", "3 tablespoons flour", "Salt and pepper", "pepper", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 large shallot, minced", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "2 plum tomatoes, finely chopped", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1/3 cup dry white wine", "1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "2 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley", "Toasted baguette slices, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the flour with some salt and pepper and toss the scallops in it.
