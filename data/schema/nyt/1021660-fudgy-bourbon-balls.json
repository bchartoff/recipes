The flavors will mellow and integrate after sitting for a few days, so the cookies will be all the better if you can plan ahead and let them ripen for three or four days. They\u2019ll keep for up to two weeks stored at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/02/dining/30cookiesrex1-balls/merlin_180351396_a544ef7a-c90d-4899-a9de-ae7128f7f8db-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H15M", "recipeYield": "4 dozen balls", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "bourbon, cocoa powder, cookie crumbs, honey, pecans, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1466}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/280 grams chocolate cookie crumbs (such as Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers or chocolate graham crackers)", "1 1/4 cups/125 grams pecans, whole, halved or pieces", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters good bourbon", "1 cup/120 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more for rolling", "3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder", "1 tablespoon honey"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together the cookie crumbs and pecans until the nuts are finely ground.
