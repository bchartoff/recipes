{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Raisin Cinnamon Roll Wreath", "description": "Perfume the house and decorate the table with this whimsical wreath made of buttery, sweet cinnamon rolls. Arranging the rolls into a ring makes it easy to tear away individual servings. The extra protein in bread flour yields a sturdier dough that\u2019s easier to shape, but all-purpose flour works too. If you assemble these a day ahead and refrigerate them overnight before baking them the next morning, be sure to let the rolls rise three-quarters of the way before placing them in the fridge. A few hours before baking, allow them to come to room temperature on the counter. Have fun, and complete the wreath decoration with dehydrated orange wheels, cinnamon sticks, sugar-dusted cranberries or even a red ribbon bow.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/15/dining/13BREAKFASTREX3/merlin_198975474_e26cad40-6d27-4533-b4ff-421afe86ae82-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen rolls", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, main course", "keywords": "christmas, new year\u2019s day, cream cheese, ground cinnamon, raisins", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 225}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/540 grams bread flour or all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "4 1/2 teaspoons/14 grams instant (fast-acting) yeast (2 packets)", "1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "6 tablespoons/78 grams unsalted butter, plus more for greasing", "2/3 cup/171 grams whole milk", "2 large eggs, at room temperature, beaten", "3 cups/480 grams dark raisins", "2 teaspoons almond extract", "2/3 cup/70 grams finely ground almond meal or flour", "2/3 cup/150 grams packed light brown sugar", "2 tablespoons ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "8 tablespoons/114 grams unsalted butter, softened", "2 tablespoons whole milk", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "4 ounces/115 grams cream cheese, softened", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "1/2 cup/60 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "3 tablespoons whole milk, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the flour, granulated sugar, yeast and salt.
