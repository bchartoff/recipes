I don\u2019t know why she served it cold, not hot; I only know that I loved it, and do still. She served it with butter lettuce and buttermilk dressing, and it is very good that way. It is also very good with hot sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/17/magazine/17eat/17mag-17eat-t_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "buttermilk, chicken thighs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 159}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups buttermilk", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "3 pounds chicken thighs, bone in, skin on", "1 1/2 cups flour", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper", "Enough shortening or peanut oil to come 6 inches up a high-sided pot"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "One day before you\u2019re frying, mix all the soaking ingredients in a big container or two.
