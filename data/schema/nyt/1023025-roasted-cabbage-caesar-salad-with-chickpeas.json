{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Cabbage Caesar Salad With Chickpeas", "description": "This is not your usual Caesar salad. It forgoes the lettuce for wedges of roasted cabbage and replaces the croutons with roasted chickpeas. The Caesar dressing is a cheater\u2019s version, using store-bought mayonnaise instead of fresh egg yolks; roasted garlic adds creamy richness, while briny capers and lemon evoke traditional Caesar flavors. A hot oven and a heated sheet pan are your friends here \u2014 start heating as soon as you think about cooking this dish \u2014 ensuring that everything cooks quickly and evenly. The cabbage caramelizes on the outside while the interior retains crisp-tenderness, and the chickpeas become warm and creamy with just a bit of crunch. (If you want them crispier, roast for 10 to 15 minutes more.) To make this dish vegan, use plant-based mayonnaise and omit the Parmesan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/07/dining/hm-roasted-cabbage-caesar/merlin_201502965_62ffcc50-587f-4d69-b928-ef3e39729b86-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cabbage, chickpea, mayonnaise, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 834}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, well drained, or 4 cups cooked chickpeas", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus 2 to 3 tablespoons more", "6 garlic cloves (1 peeled and 5 unpeeled)", "1 lemon", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "2 1/2 to 3 pounds green cabbage (about 1 medium head), cut into 8 wedges, core intact so that the wedges stay together (see Tip)", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "2 tablespoon capers, drained and finely chopped", "Parmesan, shaved or grated, for serving", "Handful of soft herbs, such as parsley or basil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees, with one rack in the middle and one at the top.
