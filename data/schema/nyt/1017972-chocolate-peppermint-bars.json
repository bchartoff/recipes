{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Peppermint Bars", "description": "A little-known fact: Creamy chocolate-covered peppermint patties are not hard to make at home. Here, the minty filling and chocolate coating are layered onto a cocoa-imbued shortbread base, which adds a cookie crunch to each bite. These keep well, so you can make them a week ahead; store airtight at room temperature. They also freeze well. The coconut oil makes the chocolate coating slightly shinier and a little more brittle in a good way, so use it if you have it. But if you don't have it on hand, you can\u00a0omit it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/20/dining/mc-peppermint-bars/mc-peppermint-bars-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "36 squares", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, peppermint extract, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 601}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 139, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "15 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/125 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons/15 grams unsweetened cocoa powder", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick)", "3 1/4 cups/405 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3 tablespoons/43 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy cream", "2 1/4 teaspoons/10 milliliters peppermint extract, or to taste", "9 ounces/255 grams bittersweet chocolate (at least 60 percent cocoa solids), chopped", "1/2 teaspoon coconut oil (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
