{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate-Cherry Ginger Cookies", "description": "These are the kind of cookies that make you want to cozy up under a warm blanket with a cup of tea and a good book. Packed full of warming spices, they have soft, chewy centers and crisp edges, and are punctuated by melty puddles of milk chocolate and tart dried cherries. They come together quickly too; no need to soften butter or chill dough. Feel free to substitute dark chocolate for a more deeply chocolaty cookie, but in either case, use chopped bar chocolate and not chips for the meltiest, tastiest bites. You can also substitute dried cranberries for the cherries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08COOKIESREX23-CHOCCHERRY/01COOKIESREX23-CHOCCHERRY-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "cherries, chocolate, christmas cookie, ginger, make-ahead, molasses, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 796}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/100 grams turbinado sugar", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted and warm", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil", "2 tablespoons Dutch-process cocoa powder", "2 1/4 teaspoons ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "3/4 teaspoon fine salt", "1/4 cup/75 grams unsulfured molasses", "1 large egg", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour", "1 3/4 teaspoons baking soda", "1 cup/140 grams roughly chopped milk chocolate bar", "1/2 cup/75 grams dried cherries or cranberries, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and heat oven to 325 degrees.
