{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oyster and Blue Cheese Pie", "description": "Fredrik Berselius, the chef and owner of the Nordic restaurant Aska in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, taught me this unusual preparation for oysters. He serves them barely cooked in a broth tarted up with pickled gooseberries and a cream sauce. The oysters are poached in their shells at 140 degrees for 4 to 5 minutes, enough time, he said, to avoid any potential problems with raw oysters. It\u2019s a genius method that can be used for any cooked oyster recipe. The bivalves are a snap to open and do not taste cooked. All you need is a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/15/dining/15PAIRING/15PAIRING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, seafood", "keywords": "blue cheese, fennel, oysters", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 27}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 601, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "686 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "Salt", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large egg, separated", "1/2 cup finely chopped leeks", "1/2 cup finely chopped fennel bulb", "1/2 cup finely chopped, peeled green apple", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "12 oysters, preferably Fishers Island or Beausoleil (East Coast), or Hood Canal (West), scrubbed", "5 ounces blue cheese, preferably Cashel Blue", "1 tablespoon minced fennel fronds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pastry dough: Heat oven to 400 degrees.
