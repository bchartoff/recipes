The frosty, austere, all-alcohol icon has bewitched palates and imaginations for more than a century, to a measure no other drink can even approach. The trend toward drier martinis, with only trace amounts of vermouth, began after World War II. (In martini vernacular, \u201cdry\u201d means less vermouth, \u201cwet\u201d means more.) That style remains popular. But, thank goodness, in recent years crusading bartenders have brought proportions back close to historical, wetter dimensions. A martini isn\u2019t a martini without the herbal tang of vermouth; a 3 to 1 ratio of gin to vermouth should satisfy both tastes, given that the vermouth is of good quality and fresh.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/23/dining/23COCKTAILS-MARTINI/23COCKTAILS-MARTINI-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bitters, gin, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 202}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 187, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": null, "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 ounces London dry gin", "3/4 ounce dry vermouth", "1 dash orange bitters", "Lemon twist or olives, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir all ingredients over ice until chilled, about 30 seconds.
