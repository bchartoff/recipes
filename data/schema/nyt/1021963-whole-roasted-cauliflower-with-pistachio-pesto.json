This version delivers a browned cauliflower that ends up soft enough \u2014 custardy almost \u2014 to serve with a spoon. And it all comes together in one pan, with water added right to the skillet to steam and soften the cauliflower while it roasts over caramelized onions. Sprinkling some Parmesan on top is a nice way to finish this dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/dining/12Passoverrex2/merlin_184764120_35b71005-a7c1-4892-95d8-d71385931df7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cast iron, cauliflower, cilantro, food processor, parsley, pistachio, skillet, passover, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2229}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head cauliflower, preferably orange (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 small yellow onions, sliced 1/4 inch thick lengthwise", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "Pinch of black pepper", "Zest of 1 lemon", "1/2 cup lightly packed cilantro and flat-leaf parsley leaves, plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup raw shelled pistachios", "1 garlic clove, sliced", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "Pinch of black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cauliflower: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 400 degrees.
