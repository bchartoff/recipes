{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb Raspberry Cobbler With Cornmeal Biscuits", "description": "Rhubarb is often paired with strawberries, but in this cobbler it courts a new dance partner, the raspberry. If rhubarb is young and fresh, you can trim it in seconds. If it has fibrous outer strings, peel these off as you would those of celery. The cornmeal in the biscuit dough will nicely offset the nubbiness of the raspberry seeds. You can eat it warm from the oven, smothered in heavy cream for dessert, then spoon up the leftovers cold the next morning for breakfast, topped with yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/06/dining/06cobbler/06cobbler-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "cornmeal, raspberries, rhubarb, dessert, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 199}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 441, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "279 milligrams", "sugarContent": "38 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds rhubarb, trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch pieces about 6 cups", "2 1/2 cups fresh raspberries or 1 10-ounce package frozen raspberries, defrosted", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar", "2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 cup all-purpose flour, more as necessary", "2/3 cup fine cornmeal", "1/4 cup sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2/3 cup heavy cream, more for brushing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
