{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin-Ginger Sorbet", "description": "This autumnal sorbet can be made vegan-friendly by substituting agave syrup for the honey. If you would rather not use canned pumpkin, try roasting honeynut squashes, 40 minutes at 400 degrees, then scraping out the insides, which become a smooth pur\u00e9e under the heat; two squashes will give you enough pur\u00e9e for this recipe.The sorbet is excellent served with slivers of candied ginger on top or with pieces of pumpkin seed brittle. And it\u2019s surprisingly amenable to tracings of chilled dark chocolate sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/dining/09frozenrex2/merlin_179473368_1cba3cbf-803b-4338-8f3a-8779175ddd0a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H20M", "recipeYield": "1 quart (6 to 8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project, dessert", "keywords": "apple cider, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, rum, sorbet, thanksgiving, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup pumpkin or winter squash pur\u00e9e, fresh or canned", "3 cups fresh apple cider", "2 tablespoons peeled, finely minced ginger", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon honey", "3 tablespoons dark rum or bourbon (optional)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan mix the pumpkin or squash with 1 cup of the cider until thoroughly incorporated.
