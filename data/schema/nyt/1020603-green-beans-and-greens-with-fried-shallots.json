{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Beans and Greens With Fried Shallots", "description": "These delightfully al dente green beans are a quick-cooking nod to the green bean casserole. There is no cream of mushroom soup, but there are fried shallots. Torn leafy greens, briefly saut\u00e9ed with a bit of butter and a few melted anchovies (which can be omitted for vegetarians), are added to the beans to wilt at the last minute for a very green-on-green side. Depending on what else you\u2019re serving, this could almost count as a salad. Be sure to finish with plenty of acid and flaky salt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/13/dining/11Romanrex4/merlin_161935386_137071aa-6441-4ccc-a962-f0b0e4b0f90c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, green beans, kale, shallot, swiss chard, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 461}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup olive oil", "3 large shallots, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 pounds green beans, trimmed", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 anchovy fillets", "1 large bunch kale or Swiss chard, thick stems removed, leaves torn into bite-size pieces", "2 tablespoons apple cider, white wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice, plus more for seasoning", "Flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil and shallots in a large skillet over medium heat.
