{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Goat Cheese and Fig Quick Bread", "description": "Here\u2019s a recipe from France, where savory loaf cakes are often served with drinks before dinner. This one started with bits of goat cheese and snips of dried figs, and then moved closer and closer to the Mediterranean. It\u2019s got fruity olive oil, a handful of parsley (for brightness), a little rosemary and thyme (to set the mood and further establish the locale), some honey (always good with goat cheese) and scrapings of clementine zest (for surprise). You can use a neutral oil, if you\u2019d like, olive or dried tomatoes instead of figs, basil instead of parsley, lemon instead of orange, or experiment with other cheeses. The loaf\u2019s pleasantly crumbly, and best enjoyed cut into thick slices.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/31/magazine/31mag-eat/31mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "snack, breads, quick breads, appetizer", "keywords": "clementines, fig, parsley, tangerine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1443}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray or butter", "4 ounces/115 grams very cold soft goat cheese", "4 moist, plump dried figs (such as Kalamata), cut into 1/4-inch bits", "1/3 cup/20 grams finely chopped fresh parsley", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary", "1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters whole milk, lukewarm", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters olive oil", "1 tablespoon honey", "1 clementine or 1/2 tangerine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
