{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Meatball and Semolina Dumpling Soup With Collard Greens", "description": "This hearty soup is a meal in a bowl. It is very much inspired by Iraqi kubba hamuth. \u201cHamuth\u201d means sour in Arabic, which refers to the soup\u2019s sour tomato and lemon broth. Traditionally, the soup contains lamb-stuffed semolina dumplings called \u201ckubba.\u201d The divergence here is that they exist as two separate components \u2014 meatballs and semolina dumplings \u2014 and add a wonderful textural contrast. If you can\u2019t find collard greens, feel free to swap these out for an equal amount of Tuscan kale.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/22/multimedia/22EAT-lamb-meatball-soup-tpfh/22EAT-lamb-meatball-soup-tpfh-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, dumplings, meatballs, main course", "keywords": "bread crumb, buttermilk, cilantro, collard greens, ground lamb, semolina flour, soup, tomato paste", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 89}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 ounces ground lamb", "2/3 cup/30 grams fresh bread crumbs (see Tip)", "1/4 cup coarsely grated onion", "Scant 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for greasing your hands", "1 small onion, peeled and roughly chopped", "5 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped", "2 jalape\u00f1os, halved, seeded and roughly chopped", "1/4 cup olive oil", "6 tablespoons/90 grams tomato paste", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 small (10-ounce) bunch collard greens, stems removed, leaves finely shredded", "1 tablespoon fine semolina", "3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 quart store-bought or homemade chicken stock", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice", "1/4 cup buttermilk, plus \u00bc cup for serving", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1 large egg", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "1 cup/50 grams fresh bread crumbs (see Tip)", "1/2 cup fine semolina"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the meatballs: Add all the ingredients minus the oil to a medium bowl and use your hands to knead the mixture thoroughly.
