You can add seasonings, if you like, or stick to the original, which calls for only sake, soy and mirin. Brown sugar gives this blend gloss and a syrupy consistency ideal for drizzling over ready-to-eat ingredients. But you could also skip the sugar and simmer just sake, soy sauce and mirin in the proportions below with your dish, thickening it into a glaze that clings to the main ingredient.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/12SAUCESREX10-salty-sweet-GK-teriyaki-sauce/12SAUCESREX10-salty-sweet-GK-teriyaki-sauce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "mirin, sake, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 225}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup sake", "1/2 cup soy sauce", "1/3 cup mirin", "3 packed tablespoons dark brown sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the sake, soy sauce, mirin and brown sugar in a small saucepan.
