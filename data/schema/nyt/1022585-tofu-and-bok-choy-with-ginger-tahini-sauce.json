{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tofu and Bok Choy With Ginger-Tahini Sauce\u00a0", "description": "This simple dish showcases the uniquely silky texture of soft tofu. The tofu is steamed on top of a layer of bok choy, eliminating the need for a formal steamer and making this meal a cinch to prepare. (Napa or savoy cabbage leaves would also make a nice bed for the tofu.) Once steamed, the warm, mild tofu soaks in all of the bright flavors of a tangy and creamy tahini sauce that\u2019s spiked with aromatic ginger and fragrant herbs. For a heftier meal, either double the tofu or serve with a side of rice.\n\nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/23/dining/kc-tofu-and-bok-choy-with-ginger-tahini-sauce/kc-tofu-and-bok-choy-with-ginger-tahini-sauce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, weekday, weeknight, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "bok choy, soft tofu, soy sauce, tahini, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 783}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound baby bok choy, quartered lengthwise through the core", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 (14- to 16-ounce) package soft (not silken) tofu, drained and cut into 4 equal squares", "6 tablespoons tahini", "1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar", "1 teaspoon minced ginger", "1/4 teaspoon minced garlic\u00a0", "1/4 cup chopped scallions (from about 1 scallion), plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro, plus more for garnish", "Toasted white sesame seeds, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet with a lid, arrange bok choy in an even layer to cover the bottom of the pan, and season with salt and pepper.
