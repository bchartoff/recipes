{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Frittata With Kasha, Leeks and Spinach", "description": "I like adding cooked grains to a frittata, but you have to choose just the right one; it should be soft, not too chewy. Rice works, and so does bulgur. But if you want to add a grain that will contribute a lot of flavor to a frittata, kasha is your grain. It is wonderfully nutty, and a cup of cooked kasha contributes just the right amount of bulk to make this frittata substantial but not at all heavy. Leeks, cooked down until sweet and tender, a small amount of baby spinach, which always partners well with kasha whether raw or cooked, lots of fresh dill and a little bit of feta are the other components. Serve this for dinner and take leftovers to work for lunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/07/science/recipehealthkashafrittata/recipehealthkashafrittata-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 57}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 275, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "372 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 good-size leeks, white and light green parts only, cut in half lengthwise, cleaned, and sliced thin", "Salt", "3 ounces baby spinach (1/2 bag), rinsed", "Freshly ground black pepper", "6 large or extra-large eggs", "2 tablespoons low-fat milk", "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017205-kasha\">1 cup cooked kasha</a>", "1/4 cup chopped fresh dill", "1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper", "2 ounces feta, crumbled (1/2 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat in a heavy 10-inch, preferably nonstick skillet.
