{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon-Tahini Slaw", "description": "This vegan recipe fulfills the need for a creamy slaw that can sit out in the sun. Instead of dairy and raw egg yolks, this slaw is slicked with tahini and mustard. Capers, lemon zest and scallions are smashed into a coarse paste, then massaged into the cabbage to lend umami and a salty punch. Snap peas and radishes add crunch, but feel free to swap in celery, jicama, fennel or other vegetables. This is a decidedly savory slaw; if you want some sweetness, add honey to the dressing, to taste. The slaw can sit out \u2014 poolside, deskside, at a picnic \u2014 for up to 3 hours, and it keeps for 3 days in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/10/dining/as-lemony-tahini-slaw/merlin_187482165_ea352120-cad8-4c0d-82fd-bc5c6ab7d911-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, slaws, side dish", "keywords": "dijon mustard, green cabbage, lemon juice, lemon zest, make-ahead, picnic, tahini, fourth of july, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2151}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons capers", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest plus 5 tablespoons lemon juice (from 2 to 3 lemons)", "6 scallions, thinly sliced", "1 medium Savoy or other green cabbage (1 1/2 to 2 pounds), cored and thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup tahini", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, plus more to taste", "8 ounces snap peas, thinly sliced lengthwise", "3 large or 6 small radishes, cut into matchsticks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chop and smash the capers, lemon zest and half the scallions together into a coarse, wet paste.
