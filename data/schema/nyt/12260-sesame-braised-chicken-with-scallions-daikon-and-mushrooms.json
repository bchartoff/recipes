She found an answer in this recipe, which relies on dry sherry, soy sauce and star-anise-infused sesame oil as its braising liquid. Daikon and shiitake mushrooms soak up the liquid and soften under its weight. Be sure to brown the bird, too. It won't crisp the skin, but it does add depth of flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/11/dining/11APPE/11APPE-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, daikon, scallion, dairy-free, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 116}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 817, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "56 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "1477 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 bunches scallions (about 3/4 pound)", "3 tablespoons peanut oil", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 pound daikon radish, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks", "1/2 cup sliced shiitake mushroom caps", "6 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled", "2 inches ginger, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 (3 1/2-pound) whole chicken", "2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "2 teaspoons black pepper", "1 cup chicken stock", "1/2 cup dry sherry", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "4 whole star anise pods", "1 1/2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar, more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
