This recipe, however, comes together in under an hour. Adapted from \u201cAt Home With Magnolia: Classic American Recipes From the Owner of Magnolia Bakery\u201d by Allysa Torey, this formula uses baking powder and baking soda to make the dough rise quickly. Toasted pecans add crunch to the cinnamon-sugar filling, and a tangy cream cheese glaze blankets the top of the rolls. The end result is tender, chewy and cakey rolls that taste best when unspooled bit by bit and eaten with your fingers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/21/dining/ML-no-yeast-cinnamon-rolls/merlin_199233678_bae5751c-1e7f-49f8-b04a-5c558dd1e5d8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, quick", "keywords": "cream cheese, freezer friendly, ground cinnamon, pecan, roll and bun", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2608}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, very soft, plus more for greasing the pan", "1/2 packed cup/110 grams light brown sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon", "3/4 cup/90 grams chopped pecans, toasted (see Tip)", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 cup/54 grams canola oil", "3/4 cup/180 grams buttermilk", "4 ounces/113 grams cream cheese, very soft", "1 cup/102 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted if lumpy", "1 teaspoon whole milk or heavy cream", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
