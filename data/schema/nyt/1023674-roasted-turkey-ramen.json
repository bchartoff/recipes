{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Turkey Ramen", "description": "On Thanksgiving night, with dinner pillaged and in ruins, Joshua Mangerson picks off the remaining meat from the turkey carcass, submerges it in chicken stock and lets it simmer. The next day, turkey leftovers are transformed into turkey ramen, with mushrooms, scallions and a six-minute egg in each bowl. The rich, cloudy broth is an ode to the Strongbow Inn, the turkey restaurant that Mr. Mangerson\u2019s great-grandmother opened in 1940 on the family turkey farm in Valparaiso, Ind. Mr. Mangerson, who worked summers at Strongbow as a teenager, makes his own chicken stock first, with chicken backs and necks collected over a summer of grilling, but you can use store-bought stock and still get a strong boost of flavor. The recipe may look labor-intensive, but \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want anyone to be scared away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to do. It just takes time, and you have to care.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/27/magazine/27mag-Eat/27mag-Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, project, main course", "keywords": "cremini, ramen noodle, shiitake, white mushroom, soup, thanksgiving leftover, turkey, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 82}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 to 10 chicken backs and necks\u00a0", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for coating", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "1 leftover carcass from a 16- to 18-pound roasted turkey, preferably including neck, wing and leg bones", "3 chicken or turkey necks (optional)\u00a0", "Extra-virgin olive oil, if needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 garlic clove, chopped fine", "1 small shallot, chopped fine", "1 cup cremini mushrooms, sliced", "1 cup white button mushrooms, sliced", "1 cup shiitake mushrooms, sliced", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground", "2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\u00a0", "6 to 8 large eggs", "6 to 8 packages ramen noodles (3 to 5 ounces each) , seasoning packs discarded\u00a0", "Leftover slices and/or large chunks of roasted turkey", "8 to 10 scallions, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces", "Sriracha, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the base stock: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
