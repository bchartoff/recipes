These are best served warm from the oven, or reheated if they cool down. Ketchup is a traditional sausage roll accompaniment, but these are so flavorful on their own they don't need it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/dining/16apperex1-mushrooms/merlin_178200039_d270f518-7822-40b4-96f1-79cd52dccd36-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 rolls", "recipeCuisine": "australian, british", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, finger foods, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "almond butter, fennel, leek, mushroom, puff pastry, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 420}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup farro", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon cider vinegar or white wine vinegar", "1 1/4 pounds mixed mushrooms, diced (about 8 cups)", "2 large leeks, white and light green parts, cut lengthwise and sliced into 1/4-inch half-moons (about 2 cups)", "1 cup diced fennel", "2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 teaspoon tomato paste", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1/2 cup creamy almond butter", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, cilantro or dill", "1 (13- to 17-ounce) package frozen vegan puff pastry, thawed but still cold"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil, then add farro.
