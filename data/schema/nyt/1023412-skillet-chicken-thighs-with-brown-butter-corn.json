Easily made in one large skillet, the chicken is cooked first before the corn kernels are added to saut\u00e9 in the drippings, seasoned with garlic, thyme and plenty of brown butter. Finished with torn basil, lime juice and scallions, it walks the line between rich and sweet, and tangy and fresh \u2014 all in under 30 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/24/dining/19Apperex-chicken/merlin_211327701_c9dafd3b-fff1-4dcb-9a9b-25ca0b35871f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "basil, brown butter, chicken thigh, corn, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 745}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 1 1/4 pounds)", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels (from 1 to 2 ears; see Tip)", "1/2 cup torn basil leaves", "Lime wedges, for serving", "2 scallions, thinly sliced, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken all over with salt and pepper.
