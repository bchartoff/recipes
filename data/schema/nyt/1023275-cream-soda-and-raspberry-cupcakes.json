The cream soda flavoring gives these cupcakes an ice cream shop vibe and can be ordered online, but vanilla will work just as well. Feel free to bake the cupcakes a day ahead and keep them in an airtight container. Top them with the mascarpone cream a couple of hours before you intend to serve them. For maximum effect, be sure to sprinkle on the popping candy only right before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/19/magazine/19mag-eat-site/19mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "12 cupcakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "birthday, mother\u2019s day, valentine\u2019s day, cream soda extract, cupcake, lemon, raspberries", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 295}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large lemon", "24 raspberries (160 grams)", "9 tablespoons/125 grams unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes, softened", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/225 grams superfine (caster) or granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon cream-soda flavor extract (see Tip) or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or extract", "2 large eggs", "1/2 cup/120 grams mascarpone", "1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour\u00a0", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt\u00a0", "14 raspberries (75 grams)", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams mascarpone", "1 cup/225 milliliters heavy whipping cream", "3 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon/40 grams superfine (caster) or granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon cream-soda flavor extract, or 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or extract", "1/2 ounce/15 grams store-bought white or pink meringues, roughly crushed (1/2 cup)", "2 tablespoons/19 grams popping candy (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cupcakes: Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit/180 degrees Celsius.
