{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetable Chow Mein", "description": "When you order chow mein in the United States, your meal is likely to look different depending on your location: In the Northeast, it might be a plate full of gravy-laden stir-fried vegetables crowned with crispy noodles, whereas on the West Coast, the strands are thick and chewy. More traditional Cantonese restaurants will serve up deep-fried noodles, but in New York City, those noodles might be softer and thinner. Some versions use soy sauce liberally, while others abstain entirely. This Hong Kong-style chow mein is from the chef <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/dining/chinese-food-lucas-sin-junzi-kitchen.html\">Lucas Sin</a>, who researches regional Chinese cuisine and how it has morphed across the globe. This recipe, from his menu at <a href=\"https://www.eatniceday.com/\">Nice Day</a>, a Chinese American takeout place in New York, is stained with soy sauce and has a robust vegetable-to-noodle ratio. It\u2019s bouncy, it has bite and it\u2019s delicious hot off the wok (or even cold from the fridge).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/17/dining/w-vegetable-chow-mein1/merlin_203654295_a5f06101-6758-4229-b2c7-291ff07db3f3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, noodles, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "bean sprouts, chives, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 484}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces fresh Hong Kong pan-fried noodles (see Tip)", "2 tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable oil", "1/2 large white or yellow onion, halved tip to tip, then sliced stem to stem \u00bc-inch-thick", "1/2 large red bell pepper, sliced into \u00bc-inch-thick strips", "1/2 large green bell pepper, sliced into \u00bc-inch-thick strips", "1 1/2 cups bean sprouts", "3/4 cup trimmed and chopped Chinese chives (cut into 2-inch segments)", "2 tablespoons light soy sauce", "1 tablespoon dark soy sauce", "1 tablespoon abalone sauce or vegetarian oyster sauce", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder or mushroom bouillon powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the noodles: Bring a large wok (or pot) of water to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauces, abalone sauce, sugar and boullion powder until everything is dissolved and evenly combined."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook noodles for 1 minute, then transfer to a colander.
