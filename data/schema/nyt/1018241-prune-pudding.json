{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Prune Pudding", "description": "This smooth, satisfying pudding recipe served at Franklin Delano Roosevelt's White House originally called for leaving the prunes in water overnight. But now that pitted prunes are readily available, an hour\u2019s soak is all you need to speed the cooking process. Sweet, but not overly so, it lends itself to delicious variations: add a bit of cardamom; sprinkle with walnuts; spoon some over thick, creamy yogurt; or try all of these together. The strong cinnamon flavor and dark color make the pudding ideal for autumn and holiday desserts. The portions here may seem small, but as with any dish involving prunes, a little goes a long way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Kurutz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/10/dining/10DEPRESSION-WEB2/10DEPRESSION-WEB2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "cinnamon stick, prune, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 258, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": "47 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound (about 2 dozen medium-size) pitted prunes", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/4 teaspoon powdered cinnamon", "1 1-inch cinnamon stick", "3 tablespoons cornstarch"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place prunes in a medium-size saucepan, pour in 2 cups hot water and let stand for 1 hour.
