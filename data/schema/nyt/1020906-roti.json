Cooks who are used to making roti at home can roll out thin, round disks that puff up as if by magic.

Put the disk in the hot pan. When bubbles start to form and the roti starts to turn white, about 30 seconds, flip it over to cook the other side. It should be puffy in places and freckled brown. If you want to fully puff the roti, use tongs to gently place it directly on a low gas flame for about 2 to 3 seconds, then quickly remove it. Use the back of a spoon to lightly coat one side of the roti with ghee, if you like, or leave plain, then tuck into a clean dishcloth to keep warm.
