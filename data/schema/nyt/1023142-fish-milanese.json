{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fish Milanese", "description": "This fast weeknight dinner features quick-cooking flounder prepared alla Milanese, the style of breading and frying meat cutlets. The fillets are lightly breaded and pan-fried until golden and crisp on the outside and tender in the middle. A lemony, brown-butter pan sauce with capers comes together quickly to add a tangy brininess to the dish. A bit of avocado on the side adds creaminess that balances the crisp fish and peppery arugula. Any leftover fish makes for terrific sandwiches the next day, stacked with lettuce, tomato, pickles and mayo.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/19/dining/kc-fish-milanese/kc-fish-milanese-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "bread crumbs, fish, flounder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 937}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "2 large eggs, beaten", "1 cup plain bread crumbs", "Salt and black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "4 (5- to 6-ounce) flounder fillets (or other thin white fish fillets)", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "5 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "2 tablespoons minced shallot", "1/4 teaspoon minced garlic", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley", "1 tablespoon capers, plus 1 tablespoon caper brine", "1 (5-ounce) package baby arugula", "1 avocado, halved, pitted, peeled and cut into wedges (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place flour, eggs and bread crumbs in three separate shallow bowls, and season each with salt and pepper.
