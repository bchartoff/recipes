{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Turkey Chili and Biscuits", "description": "In this streamlined recipe, turkey chili and buttery cornmeal biscuits are nestled together in the same skillet, and baked into a blissfully cozy one-pot meal. You can make the cornmeal batter and the chili several hours ahead \u2014 or even the night before \u2014 then bake them together right before serving, so the biscuits are at their most tender. A dollop of sour cream at the end isn\u2019t strictly necessary, but the cool milkiness is lovely with the spicy, meaty chili. Yogurt makes a fine substitute. And if you\u2019re looking to make this vegetarian, substitute faux meat or another can of beans for the turkey.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/12/dining/07appetite-chili1/merlin_199948992_611355b4-2133-4644-b498-37dc12d2b4ca-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, main course", "keywords": "biscuits, black beans, buttermilk, canned plum tomatoes, chili, cornmeal, ground turkey, pinto beans, skillet, yogurt, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1061}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/120 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/92 grams fine cornmeal", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "8 tablespoons/113 grams cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "3/4 cup/177 milliliters buttermilk or plain whole-milk yogurt", "1 scallion, thinly sliced, plus more for serving", "Milk or more buttermilk or yogurt, for finishing", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, for finishing", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound ground turkey", "1 large yellow onion, diced", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded (if desired) and diced", "3 garlic cloves, finely grated, passed through a press or minced", "1 tablespoon chili powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea or table salt, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "3/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 (14 1/2-ounce) can whole plum tomatoes (1 3/4 cups)", "2 (15-ounce) cans pinto or black beans, drained and rinsed", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems", "Sour cream (or Greek yogurt) and pickled jalape\u00f1os, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the biscuits: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar, salt and baking soda."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a pastry cutter or your hands, cut or rub in the butter until mixture resembles rolled oats.
