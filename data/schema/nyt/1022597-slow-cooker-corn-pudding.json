As the bread steam-bakes, the edges get caramelized and firm, and the center becomes soft and delicate. It\u2019s spoonable, not sliceable, and its rich texture is best served warm or at room temperature. Jalape\u00f1os vary in heat level, so taste a tiny piece before deciding how much to add. To decrease the spice level, use one chile and remove the seeds and ribs before chopping it. To maximize the spice, leave the seeds in and use two.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/29/dining/sd-corn-pudding/sd-corn-pudding-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H50M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads, side dish", "keywords": "cheese, corn, cornmeal, jalape\u00f1o, scallion, slow cooker, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 189}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray or vegetable oil\u00a0", "1 cup whole milk", "1/2 cup sour cream (4 ounces)", "3 large eggs", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil\u00a0", "2/3 cup all-purpose flour (3 ounces)", "1/2 cup medium-grind cornmeal, preferably stone-ground (2.2 ounces)", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "4 cups corn kernels, cut from 5 small ears or 2 (10-ounce) bags frozen corn, thawed\u00a0", "3 scallions, thinly sliced\u00a0", "1 to 2 jalape\u00f1os, stemmed and finely chopped", "1 cup grated sharp Cheddar (4 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Generously coat the interior of a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray or vegetable oil.
