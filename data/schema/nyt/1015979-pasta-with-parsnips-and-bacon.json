And they\u2019re another vehicle for the creamy, bacon-rich sauce. You can roast the parsnips several hours ahead (they\u2019ll be fine at room temperature). But the rest of the dish is best made just before serving. Then serve it hot. There are few dishes that are cozier on a cold winter night.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/29/dining/29APPE1_SUBSPAN/29APPE1_SUBSPAN-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bacon, parsnip, pasta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1306}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1254, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "123 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "68 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "sodiumContent": "1202 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 medium parsnips (3/4 pound), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "Kosher salt and black pepper, as needed", "1/2 pound dried campanelle or farfalle pasta", "1/4 pound bacon, diced", "1 medium leek, thinly sliced", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
