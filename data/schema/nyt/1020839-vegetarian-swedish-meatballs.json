Seasoned generously with allspice and nutmeg and blanketed in a velvety mushroom gravy, they are excellent served over egg noodles or mashed potatoes \u2014 or spooned onto a toasted hero (add sliced tangy pickles to balance out the richness). Leftover cooked meatballs can be frozen and reheated in a 425-degree oven until warmed through, about 15 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/27/dining/kc-vegetarian-swedish-meatballs/kc-vegetarian-swedish-meatballs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "2 dozen meatballs", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, finger foods, meatballs, vegetables", "keywords": "allspice, bread crumbs, chickpea, mushroom, mushroom stock, nutmeg, appetizer, main course, side dish, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 527}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons bulgur wheat", "4 cremini mushrooms, stemmed and quartered", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1/3 cup plain bread crumbs", "1/4 cup sour cream", "1 large egg", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg", "Canola oil, for greasing", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups mushroom stock (or vegetable stock)", "1 tablespoon sour cream", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the meatballs: Heat oven to 375 degrees.
