{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Torta Rustica With Ricotta and Spinach", "description": "Torta rustica (also called pizza rustica) is a rich, ricotta-stuffed pie that\u2019s traditionally baked for Easter in Southern Italy. This version includes greens (either spinach or chard) for color and freshness. The ham is optional; feel free to leave it out, or substitute chopped olives or sundried tomatoes if you\u2019re looking for a similar savory bite. The crust, adapted from Nancy Harmon Jenkins\u2019s 2007 cookbook, \u201cCucina del Sole,\u201d is sturdy and slightly sweet, which makes a nice contrast to the salty filling.
