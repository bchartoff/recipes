{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seis Leches Cake", "description": "This recipe for a tres leches cake (a traditional syrup-soaked confection from Latin America) takes a good thing \u2014 namely the combination of milks that saturate its crumb \u2014 and doubles it. Instead of just the usual three milks (sweetened condensed, evaporated and heavy cream), it calls for six, adding coconut milk, condensed coconut milk and dulce de leche. Like the original version, it\u2019s a dense, puddinglike cake flavored with cinnamon and rum. But here, notes of coconut and caramel lend complexity and even more richness. Serve this in small squares, preferably with a bitter espresso or some tea to sip between syrupy bites.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/22/dining/17apperex/17apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "18 servings", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "coconut milk, dulce de leche, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 506}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons/75 grams melted unsalted butter, plus more softened butter for greasing the pan", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for sprinkling", "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus a pinch", "6 large eggs, separated", "3 tablespoons/45 milliliters whole milk", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk", "1 cup/240 milliliters evaporated milk", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters sweetened condensed coconut milk (a 7-ounce can, or use more regular condensed milk)", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters sweetened condensed milk", "3 tablespoons dark or amber rum", "1 cup/240 milliliters dulce de leche", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
