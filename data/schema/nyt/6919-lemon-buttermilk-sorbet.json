{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon-Buttermilk Sorbet", "description": "A bite of this refreshing sorbet is like stepping into a cold shower on a hot summer day. Thanks to the juice and zest of an entire lemon, this four-ingredient frozen treat has plenty of zing, but the creaminess of the buttermilk and the earthiness of the vanilla mellow it all out so you're not left with an unpleasant pucker. A quick note: The zest and the vanilla seeds can clump a bit during the churning process. Just stir it into the sorbet before serving (for soft serve) or freezing (for a firmer sorbet).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/19/dining/19COOKING-SORBET1/19COOKING-SORBET1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "about 3 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "buttermilk, lemon, vanilla bean, dessert, low-fat, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 57}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 154, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "233 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup sugar", "2 cups low-fat buttermilk", "1 inch-long piece vanilla bean, scraped", "Juice and zest of 1 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, combine sugar with 1/2 cup water.
