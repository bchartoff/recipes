{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Raspberry Swirl No-Bake Cheesecake", "description": "This stunning magenta-swirled dessert uses fresh or frozen raspberries to dress up a light and creamy no-bake cheesecake, making it a treat you can enjoy year-round. The recipe calls for straining the raspberry sauce to remove the seeds, but adding a small spoonful of the seeds back to the pur\u00e9e for texture and crunch is a nice touch. Make sure to allow plenty of time (at least 8 hours) for the cheesecake to chill and set before slicing. Even then, this silky dessert will be softer and more pudding-like than a traditional baked cheesecake. That's the beauty of it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/dining/ya-raspberry-swirled-cheesecake/ya-raspberry-swirled-cheesecake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes, custards and puddings", "keywords": "cream cheese, graham cracker, heavy cream, lemon, raspberries, sour cream, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 185}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 451, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "307 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 to 3 cups fresh or frozen raspberries (from a 12-ounce/340-gram bag)", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams graham cracker crumbs (from about 15 sheets of crackers)", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "Pinch of kosher salt", "16 ounces/450 grams cream cheese, softened", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters sour cream or labneh", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream, cold", "Fresh raspberries, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Combine the raspberries, sugar and lemon zest in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
