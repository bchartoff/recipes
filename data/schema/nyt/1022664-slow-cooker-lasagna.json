{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Lasagna", "description": "This easy slow-cooker lasagna is satisfying in all the ways that matter: Rich ricotta-Parmesan-spinach layers alternate with tender noodles, melted mozzarella and tomato. (A slow cooker will not give the crispiness that an oven does, but you may not even miss it.) It\u2019s also petite compared to many other lasagnas, perfect for feeding a family, not a crowd. If you\u2019ve ever had a one-pot pasta, the texture of the noodles will be familiar to you: They are tender and starchy. Don\u2019t use no-boil or fresh noodles, as they will overcook. If you like, brown some loose Italian sausage in a skillet, pour off the fat and add it with the tomato sauce layers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/19/dining/sd-slow-cooker-lasagna/merlin_195505110_f341c7d0-9a4c-4ba8-91fb-f586dca73142-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H10M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, pastas, main course", "keywords": "lasagna, lasagna noodles, marinara sauce, ricotta, slow cooker, spinach, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 585}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound whole-milk ricotta cheese (about 2 cups)", "1 (10-ounce) bag or box frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry", "3 ounces finely grated Parmesan (about 1 scant cup)", "1/2 cup lightly packed, roughly chopped basil leaves, plus more for topping", "5 garlic cloves, grated or pressed", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Olive oil", "1 (32-ounce) jar good-quality marinara sauce", "9 lasagna noodles (7 to 8 ounces)", "8 ounces shredded mozzarella (2 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, stir together the ricotta, spinach, Parmesan, basil, garlic, oregano, onion powder, \u00bc teaspoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 6- to 7-quart slow cooker with olive oil.
