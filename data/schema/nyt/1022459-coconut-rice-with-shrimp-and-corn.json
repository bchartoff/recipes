{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Rice With Shrimp and Corn", "description": "This summery, one-pot dish has everything you need: fresh shrimp nestled in creamy coconut rice, with pops of summer corn and basil. Lime cuts through the richness and adds some bright tartness. To easily shave corn kernels off the cob, lay your cob flat on your cutting board. With a chef\u2019s knife, lob off one side. Rotate the cob so that the flat side is on the cutting board and repeat, running around all four sides. Frozen wild shrimp is an excellent weeknight staple, as it thaws and cooks quickly. You can always keep it on hand and thaw just as much as you need, which ensures optimal freshness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/06/dining/SSe-coconut-rice-with-shrimp/merlin_192092625_e713215f-a23a-43fe-baab-db1136bb9989-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, one pot, seafood", "keywords": "basil, coconut milk, corn, grain bowl, jasmine rice, shrimp, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3128}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons coconut oil", "1 small yellow onion, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons peeled and finely chopped fresh ginger", "1 small jalape\u00f1o, seeded and finely chopped\u00a0", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 1/2 cups jasmine rice", "1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "1 pound peeled and deveined large shrimp", "1 1/2 cups corn kernels, fresh (from 2 cobs) or frozen", "1 lime, zested, then sliced into wedges", "1 cup fresh basil leaves, torn, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, heavy pot, heat coconut oil over medium.
