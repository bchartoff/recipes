{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chung Yul Bang (Scallion Pancakes)", "description": "The cookbook author Grace Young learned to make these scallion pancakes from her mother, who is from Hong Kong, and first published the formula in her book \u201cThe Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen\u201d (Simon & Schuster, 1999). In homage to the Cantonese immigrant experience, Ms. Young phoneticized dish names in the same way they appeared on Cantonese-American restaurant menus and titled this recipe chung yul bang. They have the perfect blend of crispy flakiness and tenderness. The trick is a mix of boiling and cold water: The boiling water gives you a soft, malleable dough that is easy to work, the cold water just the right chewiness in the fried pancake. She prefers these served without any dipping sauce: \u201cHot out of the wok, they don\u2019t need anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect the way they are.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rachel Wharton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/21/dining/16doughrex3/merlin_185502165_485fcfac-dc6c-42e7-8029-8eb71be5f679-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 cakes", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, pancakes, main course, side dish", "keywords": "scallion, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 402}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/270 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar", "2/3 cup/160 grams boiling water", "1/4 cup/60 grams cold water, plus more as needed", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil", "Kosher salt", "1/3 cup/26 grams finely minced scallions, patted completely dry", "2/3 cup/144 grams vegetable oil, or as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium heatproof bowl, stir together the flour and sugar.

Carefully flip the cake over and fry until the other side is golden brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute more. As it fries, adjust the heat to maintain a steady sizzle and lightly press the center of the cake with a metal spatula to make sure the center is cooked through, being careful of oil spatters. Alternatively, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high and pan-fry a round of dough until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes.
