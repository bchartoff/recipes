{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Velvet", "description": "The story goes that a steward at the Brook\u2019s Club in London created this classic in 1861 to observe the death of Prince Albert. I hope the steward was aware that there's something beautifully subversive about combining a laborer\u2019s favorite, porter, with champagne, the stuff of monarchs and other aristocrats. Social statement or not, it\u2019s a great drink. The usual proportions are 50/50, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with playing with them. I tend to favor a bit more champagne than Guinness, for a lighter Black Velvet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/20/magazine/20drink/20mag-20drink-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "champagne, stout", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 24}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 94, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": null, "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "7 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 oz.
