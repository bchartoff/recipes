{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tomato Jam", "description": "Tomato jam is a strong reminder that tomatoes are, indeed, a fruit. They produce a delicious, spreadable, not-too-sweet jam that gives ketchup a run for its money. Adding in aromatics like crushed garlic, herbs or whole dried chiles can deepen the jam's flavor, making it firmly savory.\n\nWe've read your notes and have since added a tablespoon of vinegar to the recipe, to bolster the amount of acid necessary for safe canning. (On their own, tomatoes may not have enough acid to prevent the growth of botulism spores.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/07/dining/07JAMGUIDE8/07JAMGUIDE8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 cups (about 2 8-ounce jars)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "summer, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 83}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds/1.8 kilograms medium red or green tomatoes (do not use heirloom), cored and cut into 1-inch chunks", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon white distilled vinegar or red wine vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Add-ins (optional, see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss tomatoes, sugar and salt together in a large, heavy bottomed pot.

Using a wooden spoon or spatula, stir the jam, occasionally at first and more frequently as the juices thicken. Do this until most of the liquid has evaporated and the tomatoes have begun to break down, and the mixture resembles a very thick, shiny tomato sauce, 35 to 45 minutes. This is the stage at which it\u2019s most important to stir constantly along the bottom of the pot to prevent scorching and sticking. (Sugar is heavier than water and will concentrate at the bottom of the pot, increasing the chance that the fruit will burn.) How much the tomatoes break down will depend on their type and how ripe they are: For example, firm green tomatoes are likely to remain chunky, while ripe red tomatoes will break down almost entirely."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To test for thickness, spoon a bit of jam onto the chilled plate, return it to the refrigerator and chill for 2 minutes.
