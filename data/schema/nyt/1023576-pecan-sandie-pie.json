{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pecan Sandie Pie", "description": "All the richness of pecans, buttery and crisp in the cookie crust, candied in the gooey filling, run through this pie. In this take on a Thanksgiving classic, standard pie dough is swapped for pecan sandie dough. It\u2019s not only tastier with its nuttiness, it also doesn\u2019t require rolling. You can simply pat it into the pan and into a round for the top. For a toastier flavor and a little more crunch, bake the pecans first in a 350-degree oven until fragrant and a shade darker.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/13/dining/13PIESREX-pecan-sandie/merlin_214872375_a4045ea4-51fd-448f-9ff9-d06a786f7cf6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "corn syrup, dark brown sugar, dark chocolate, food processor, make-ahead, milk chocolate, pecan, pecan pie, white chocolate, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 968}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/80 grams pecans, lightly toasted if you\u2019d like", "1 2/3 cups/209 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/34 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more for dusting", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1/2 cup/114 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, plus more for the pan", "1 large egg, beaten", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "2 ounces/56 grams dark, milk or white chocolate", "1 cup/350 grams dark corn syrup", "3/4 cup/165 grams packed dark brown sugar", "3 tablespoons/42 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon rye or other whiskey (optional)", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1 1/2 cups/160 grams finely chopped pecans, lightly toasted if you\u2019d like"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Pulse the pecans in a food processor until coarsely ground.
