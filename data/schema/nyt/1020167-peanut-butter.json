{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peanut Butter", "description": "Peanut butter is an essential pantry item, and a perfect building block to pack protein into on-the-go snacks. Making your own from scratch means you control what goes into it (no sugar or hydrogenated oils, or excessive salt). Roasting the raw peanuts until deep golden is the key to achieving a flavorful result. If your raw peanuts have skins, leave them on; they add extra fiber, antioxidants and toasty flavor. A few pinches of ground cinnamon, or a couple tablespoonfuls of chia seeds, currants or honey can be added to provide crunch, warm spice or a touch of sweetness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/09/dining/kc-peanut-butter/kc-peanut-butter-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "1 3/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "peanut, salt", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 248, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "8 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound raw, skin-on peanuts (about 3 cups)", "Kosher salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
