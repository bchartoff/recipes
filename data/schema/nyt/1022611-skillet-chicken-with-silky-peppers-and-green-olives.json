{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken With Silky Peppers and Green Olives", "description": "Made with diced fresh tomato and colorful sweet bell peppers, this savory chicken dish is lively and bright. Cooked as written, the sauce is on the brothy side, perfect for pouring over rice or couscous, or for sopping up with bread. But if you prefer it to be heartier, remove the chicken pieces from the pan once they\u2019re cooked, then simmer to reduce the sauce, stirring occasionally, for another 5 to 8 minutes. Return chicken to the pan and stir in olives, then garnish with herbs to serve.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/13/dining/08Apperex-chicken1/08Apperex-chicken1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, poultry, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, chicken thighs, olives", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 874}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh oregano (or 2 teaspoons dried)", "2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 red, yellow or orange bell peppers (or a combination of colors)", "5 garlic cloves", "1 medium fresh tomato", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "3/4 cup pitted, roughly chopped green olives, such as Castelvetrano", "1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley, basil, cilantro or a combination", "Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken dry with paper towels.
