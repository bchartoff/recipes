{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mai Tai", "description": "There are raging debates about the invention of and the proper recipe for this drink among tiki connoisseurs. The more accepted versions are granted to Victor J. Bergeron, the irascible, wooden-legged \u201cTrader Vic,\u201d from his eponymous restaurant bar in Oakland, Calif., in the \u201940s. Contrary to what you might think, the mai tai is actually just a rum sour, employing orgeat alongside Cura\u00e7ao or triple sec as the sweetener, and using two rums to add complexity. The rest is just lime juice, and that\u2019s it. No coconut, no passion fruit, pineapple, mango or orange juice. No umbrellas. It\u2019s a relatively simple drink, but as such, each element has to be of the utmost quality; great rums, fresh lime juice and prefab orgeat syrup equal disappointment. But when concocted with homemade orgeat, all the tumblers click. The rums, the lime, the orange aromatics and the heft of the almond all play in stupendous balance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Toby Cecchini"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/06/t-magazine/06casestudy-maitai/06casestudy-maitai-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "Serves 1", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy, cocktails", "keywords": "orgeat syrup, rum", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 22}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 232, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "7 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce light rum (I had great results with Banks\u2019 5 Island)", "1 ounce gold rum (Appleton\u2019s Estate Reserve, Zacapa, Cl\u00e9ment V.S.O.P., El Dorado 12-year)", "\u00bd ounce orgeat syrup (see <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1015317/homemade-orgeat-syrup.html\">recipe</a>)", "\u00bd ounce orange Cura\u00e7ao or Cointreau", "Juice of 1 lime."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine ingredients in a shaker with crushed or cracked ice and shake vigorously.
