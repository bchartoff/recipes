{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Best Black Bean Soup", "description": "This American classic can be a perfect dish: big-tasting, filling, nutritious, easy and very possibly vegetarian. With their rich natural broth, turtle beans do not need bacon, ham or any meat ingredient to make a satisfying soup. Black bean soup recipes have a tendency to turn out sludgy or bland, but the trick here is to season generously, and pur\u00e9e sparingly. The beans should be swimming in liquid, not sitting in sludge: The more beans are pur\u00e9ed, the more starch is released into the soup. For flavor, this recipe deploys marinated chipotle chiles, but a tablespoon each of ground cumin and ground coriander make a good heat-free substitute. (A note: Since there is acid from the wine here, if your tap water is hard there might be a reaction that will prevent the beans from softening. To be safe, add the wine later, along with the stock. And if there is any question about the hardness of your water, use distilled.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/28/dining/1702anSoupNYT191/1702anSoupNYT191-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, black beans, chicken stock, chipotles in adobo, jalape\u00f1o, red onion, red wine, vegetable stock, fall, winter, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3336}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small (7-ounce) can chipotle chiles in adobo (see note)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 carrots, peeled and chopped", "2 onions, peeled and chopped", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 cup red wine", "2 jalape\u00f1o peppers, seeded and chopped", "1 pound dry black beans (do not soak)", "2 quarts mild vegetable or chicken stock", "1 tablespoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican", "2 bay leaves", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Red wine vinegar, to taste", "1 small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced", "Freshly squeezed juice of 2 limes", "Salt", "Sour cream or Mexican crema", "Whole cilantro leaves", "Thinly sliced fresh chiles", "Sliced avocado"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Empty the can of chiles into a blender or food processor.
