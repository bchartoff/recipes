{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro Salad with Leeks, Chickpeas and Currants", "description": "Sliced leeks are wonderful roasted: they caramelize in the oven, becoming tender and sweet, their edges crisp. This recipe combines them with spicy marinated chickpeas and sweet currants for a hearty, satisfying side-dish salad. You could easily turn it into a main course by adding grated cheese (maybe ricotta salata or aged Cheddar) and nuts (pistachios, pine nuts, pecans). And also feel free substitute any other cooked bean or dried fruit; chopped apricots or cherries would work particularly well, as would navy or cannellini beans. The recipe makes a very large bowlful, but sturdy farro holds up well in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/23/dining/23APPETITE_SPAN/23APPETITE_SPAN-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "chickpea, farro, leek, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 264}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 557, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "528 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large leeks, halved lengthwise, cleaned and sliced crosswise 1/4-inch thick", "2/3 cup plus 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 1/4 teaspoons coarse kosher salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "3 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas (or two 15-ounce cans, drained)", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, preferably from Meyer lemons (2 to 3 lemons), more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon crushed red chile flakes", "1 garlic clove, minced", "2 cups dry farro", "2/3 cup dried currants", "1/2 cup chopped celery leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
