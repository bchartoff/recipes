{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pastrami Hash With Confit Potatoes, Parsley and Shallots", "description": "A dish that calls to the hearts and stomachs of the meat-and-potatoes crowd, breakfast hash is thrillingly easy to cook and deeply satisfying to eat. Because a key ingredient in hash is meat that is already cooked, it\u2019s perfect for leftovers and friendly for home cooks. (So feel free to try the recipe with roast beef instead of the pastrami, or even leftover pork and chicken.) Here, in classic form, the dish also includes potatoes for starch and onions for sweetness. A couple of lightly fried eggs on top will provide a sauce that brings all the flavors together.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/06/dining/06hash/06hash-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch", "keywords": "gluten-free, pastrami, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 32}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds medium-size waxy potatoes like Yukon Gold", "6 cups canola oil", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "3 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces", "1/4 cup minced shallots", "2 teaspoons minced garlic", "1/3 cup finely chopped parsley", "1/2 pound pastrami, corned beef, roast beef, cooked pork or chicken in bite-size pieces", "Poached or sunny-side-up eggs, for serving", "Hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the potatoes in a pot large enough to hold them in a single layer.
