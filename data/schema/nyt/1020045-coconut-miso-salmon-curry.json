{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut-Miso Salmon Curry", "description": "This light, delicate weeknight curry comes together in less than 30 minutes and is defined by its deep miso flavor. Miso is typically whisked into soups toward the end of the recipe, but sweating it directly in the pot with ginger, garlic and a little oil early on helps the paste caramelize, intensifying its earthy sweetness. Adding coconut milk creates a rich broth that works with a wide range of seafood. Salmon is used here, but flaky white fish, shrimp or scallops would all benefit from this quick poaching method. A squeeze of lime and a flurry of fresh herbs keep this curry bright and citrusy. For a hit of heat, garnish with sliced fresh jalape\u00f1o or serrano chile peppers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/dining/kc-miso-salmon-coconut-curry/merlin_150673143_c1eaa896-8f16-4688-9e2f-1de30b42c54c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, curries, seafood", "keywords": "coconut milk, ginger, lime, miso, rice, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2651}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 577, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "761 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "1 medium red onion, halved and sliced 1/2-inch thick (about 2 cups)", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, minced (about 2 tablespoons)", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup white miso", "1/2 cup unsweetened, full-fat canned coconut milk", "1 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillet, cut into 2-inch pieces", "5 ounces baby spinach (about 5 packed cups)", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving", "Steamed rice, such as jasmine or basmati, for serving", "1/4 cup chopped fresh basil", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium.
