Many shrimp boils call for adding corn, sausage and potatoes to the pot. This one focuses solely on the shrimp, though feel free to add the other ingredients if you\u2019d like to bulk it up. Crusty bread for serving is a must, both to sop with the last bits of broth and butter, and as a palate-soother, for when the building heat of the cayenne and hot sauce starts to burn.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/dining/15shrimprex2/merlin_162067362_e0db2b77-f221-4f87-bcfe-31b44fcff9d2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "butter, cayenne, lemon, Old Bay, shrimp, tabasco sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 30}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large onion, halved", "1 head garlic, sliced in half crosswise to expose the cloves", "1/4 cup Old Bay seasoning", "1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3/4 stick)", "1 lemon, halved", "1 tablespoon minced shallot (optional)", "1 tablespoon Tabasco or Crystal hot sauce, plus more as needed", "2 pounds large shell-on shrimp", "Crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 6 cups water with the onion, garlic, Old Bay, peppercorns, salt and cayenne to a boil in a large pot.
