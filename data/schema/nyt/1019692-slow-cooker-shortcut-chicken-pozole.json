{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Shortcut Chicken Pozole", "description": "Part of the joy of pozole is topping it generously and exactly as you like, and this take on the original dish is no exception. Traditional red pozole often requires toasting and then pur\u00e9eing dried chiles for a flavorful broth, but this version relies on canned chipotles in adobo sauce. Adjust the chiles to your taste: more if you like it, less if you don\u2019t. This brothy, smoky-spicy chicken soup is sensational with crunchy add-ons like crushed chips, shaved cabbage and red onion.\n\n<p><em>The pressure-cooker version of this recipe is available <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020110-pressure-cooker-chipotle-chicken-pozole\">here</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/dining/sd-pozole/sd-pozole-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 to 5 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken legs, chipotles in adobo, garlic powder, hominy, lime, onion powder, pozole, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 894, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "58 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "65 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "1712 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large red or yellow onion, peeled and quartered", "2 carrots, trimmed and halved", "2 celery stalks, halved", "8 garlic cloves", "1 (7-ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "3 to 3 1/2 pounds skin-on whole chicken legs (about 5 legs)", "5 cups chicken broth or stock", "Kosher salt, for seasoning", "1 cup frozen corn", "1 (29-ounce) can pozole (hominy), rinsed and well drained", "Juice of 1 lime, plus more for serving", "Crushed chips, shredded cabbage, diced avocado, minced red onion and-or cilantro, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the onion, carrot, celery and garlic in a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker.
