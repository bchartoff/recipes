Ottolenghi\u2019s recipe calls for date syrup, but he says that maple syrup can be substituted. I found date syrup in my Persian market, then tasted other sweeteners to compare and found that agave nectar, which has no sugar added, was pretty close, so that\u2019s what I used.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/23/science/26recipehealthpuree/26recipehealthpuree-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "2 2/3 cups, serving 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 40}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 77, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "290 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds beets (4 medium), roasted <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/health/nutrition/04recipehealth.html?ref=beets\">beets</a>", "2 garlic cloves, crushed", "1 cup plain Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon agave syrup or date syrup", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus additional for drizzling", "1 teaspoon ground caraway seeds", "1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, to taste", "Salt to taste", "For garnish: a handful of chopped, toasted almonds (2 to 4 tablespoons)", "Pita bread for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel beets and cut into wedges.
