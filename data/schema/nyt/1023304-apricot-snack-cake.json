{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apricot Snack Cake", "description": "This simple and tender cake is prepared entirely in the food processor, with juicy apricots, fragrant vanilla and nutty almond flour, which accentuates the fruity flavor. The apricots add natural tartness to balance the rich, buttery cake, but the cake also works well with other stone fruits, like peaches, plums and nectarines. It\u2019s an ideal recipe for using overripe fruits, if you\u2019ve bought too many and can\u2019t eat them fast enough. Perfect for breakfast with coffee or tea, this snacking cake is a great pick-me-up treat any time of day. For dessert, toast the slices and serve warm topped with whipped cream, ice cream or macerated fruit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/07/dining/07kc-apricot-snacking-cake/07kc-apricot-snacking-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-5-inch loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "almond flour, apricot, sliced almonds, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes, plus more for greasing pan", "1/2 cup/55 grams sliced almonds", "1/2 cup/105 grams granulated sugar\u00a0", "1/2 packed cup/70 grams light brown sugar\u00a0", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "2 large eggs", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\u00a0", "1 cup/142 grams all-purpose flour\u00a0", "3/4 cup/72 grams fine almond flour", "8 ounces ripe apricots, halved, pitted, then each half quartered", "Honey, whipped cream or ice cream, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the middle position of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees.
