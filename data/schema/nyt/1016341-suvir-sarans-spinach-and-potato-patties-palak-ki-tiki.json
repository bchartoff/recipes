The big, spicy burgers are incredibly easy to put together and to cook. Suvir serves them with chutney, either green or tamarind, but we both agree that they\u2019re delicious with plain old ketchup. I made a quick raita to serve with the burgers by stirring sweet pickle relish into plain yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/13/science/15recipehealth/15recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "Makes 10 substantial burgers (about 3 1/2 inches)", "recipeCuisine": "american, indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 262}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 141, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "337 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds red boiling potatoes, scrubbed and quartered", "4 firmly packed cups finely chopped, stemmed, washed spinach (about 3/4 pound leaves)", "1 fresh, hot green chili, finely chopped", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "1 teaspoon garam masala", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Salt to taste (Suvir Saran uses about 1 1/4 teaspoons)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 cup panko or chickpea flour (you will not use all of it)", "2 tablespoons grape seed oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam potatoes over 1 inch of boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes.
