{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame-Brown Butter Udon Noodles", "description": "This weeknight meal is silky, slurpable and so quick to pull off. It follows the tradition of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022684-mushroom-wafu-pasta?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=1\">wafu</a> or Japanese-style pasta, and combines brown butter, udon and spinach, but the classic combination of savory sauce, chewy noodle and green vegetable allows plenty of room for improvisation. Instead of soy sauce, you can add umami with Parmesan, miso, seaweed or mushrooms. Instead of black pepper for heat, grab ginger or chile flakes, oil or paste. For more protein, boil eggs or shelled edamame in the water before the udon, or add tinned mackerel or fresh yuba along with the sesame seeds. Udon noodles, found fresh, frozen or shelf-stable, are singularly bouncy and thick; if you can\u2019t find them, use the thinner, dried style that resembles linguine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/28/dining/as-sesame-brown-butter-udon-noodles/as-sesame-brown-butter-udon-noodles-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, noodles, main course, side dish", "keywords": "brown butter, sesame seed, soy sauce, spinach, udon noodle, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1138}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "14 to 16 ounces udon, preferably thick fresh, frozen or shelf-stable noodles", "1 pound baby spinach or coarsely chopped or torn mature spinach", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper, plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce, plus more as needed", "Pinch of granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
