Instead, the sauce is thickened by the pasta\u2019s starch: As the noodles cook in milk, the milk thickens to the consistency of cream and the pasta absorbs the seasonings. Here, that\u2019s garlic powder, but you could also use mustard powder, ground cayenne or grated nutmeg like in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/50-how-to-make-mac-and-cheese\">traditional mac and cheese</a>. The broccoli pieces end up soft and sweet, but if you want more bite, add them halfway through cooking.
