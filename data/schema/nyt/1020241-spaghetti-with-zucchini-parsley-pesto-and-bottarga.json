Bottarga has a bright, briny flavor and is used to\u00a0complement\u00a0any number of dishes. Here, a simple zucchini pasta with a bright green (cheeseless, nutless) parsley pesto is showered with grated bottarga and crisp bread crumbs. Look for bottarga at Italian shops or online. It\u2019s available grated, but it is better to buy whole lobes and grate your own.\u00a0Once the\u00a0package is opened,\u00a0it will keep\u00a0for months\u00a0in the refrigerator.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/21kitchrex-spaghetti/21kitchrex-spaghetti-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "bread crumbs, garlic, spaghetti, zucchini, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups roughly chopped parsley", "4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped, or 2 tablespoons finely chopped green garlic", "Salt and pepper", "3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound spaghetti", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 pounds medium zucchini, cut in 1/2-inch cubes (about 4 cups)", "Salt and pepper", "Large pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "4 tablespoons grated bottarga (4 to 6 ounces)", "About 1/2 cup toasted bread crumbs (see Note)", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pesto: Put parsley in a food processor or blender.
