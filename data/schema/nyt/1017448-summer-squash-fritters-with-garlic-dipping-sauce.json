{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Summer Squash Fritters With Garlic Dipping Sauce", "description": "David Venable, the most popular host on QVC, has a reputation for comfort food in its most cheesy, porky forms. But he is also a son of the South, and loves his summer vegetables. This recipe shows off his appreciation of both and is a delicious way to use up summer squash. It might seem daunting to peel 20 cloves of garlic, but you can make quick work of it by smashing the unpeeled cloves lightly with the side of a knife. The papery part will be easy to remove, and the cloves will still roast up mellow and soft. The resulting sauce is also excellent on sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/10/dining/10JPDAVID3/10JPDAVID3-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H25M", "recipeYield": "About 18 fritters", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, snack, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, cheddar, garlic, mayonnaise, yellow squash, zucchini, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 287}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 254, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "179 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["20 garlic cloves, peeled (about 2 heads)", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup mayonnaise", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/4 cup chives, minced", "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup shredded white Cheddar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup cold beer", "1 cup grated zucchini (about one 6- to 7-ounce zucchini), drained on paper towels 15 minutes", "1 cup grated yellow squash (about one 6-to 7-ounce squash), drained on paper towels 15 minutes", "1 small yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1/2 cup canola oil, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Prepare the dipping sauce:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees, put garlic cloves in a small baking dish and add enough olive oil to cover.
