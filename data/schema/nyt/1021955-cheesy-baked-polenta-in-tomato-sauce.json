{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Baked Polenta in Tomato Sauce", "description": "This recipe is quite forgiving in that there\u2019s plenty of wiggle room to play. Use whatever herbs and cheeses you have on hand, for example, adjust the spice levels as preferred, and opt for fresh tomatoes if they\u2019re in season, or chopped canned tomatoes instead of whole. You can also veganize the dish entirely by using a nondairy milk and vegan cheese, adding some nutritional yeast if you like. This hearty main needs nothing more than some lightly cooked greens to eat alongside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/dining/12Ottorex/merlin_184820133_1d127984-655c-4f8f-a209-5953b39a7dc0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, main course", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, fontina, onion, oregano, parmesan, polenta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 572}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 3/4 cups/660 milliliters whole milk", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/3 cups/200 grams instant polenta", "2/3 cup/60 grams roughly grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters olive oil", "2 small yellow onions, peeled and finely chopped (about 2 1/2 cups/360 grams)", "6 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/3 packed cup/10 grams fresh oregano leaves", "2 (14-ounce/410-gram) cans (tins) plum tomatoes, roughly crushed by hand", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "7 ounces/200 grams fontina cheese or buffalo mozzarella, very thinly sliced", "1/3 cup/30 grams finely grated Parmesan", "2 scant tablespoons/5 grams finely chopped fresh parsley", "1/3 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut out a piece of parchment paper about 16-by-12 inches/40-by-30 centimeters in size and lay onto a clean work surface."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the polenta: Add the milk, garlic, 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper to a medium saucepan.
