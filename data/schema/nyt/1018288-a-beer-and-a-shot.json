But I\u2019ve heard more than one bar regular refer to a beer and a shot, with tongue in cheek, as his or her favorite \u201ccocktail.\u201d The classic combo of a beer (on draft or in a bottle) and a shot of whiskey is also often called a boilermaker, but some will insist that it\u2019s only a boilermaker if the whiskey is added directly to the beer. I\u2019d rather keep the components separate, thanks, and, in keeping with venerable dive-bar tradition, I\u2019ll take mine with very cold beer that doesn\u2019t demand much from the palate (usually a lager) and bottom-shelf bourbon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/11/magazine/11drink2/11drink2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "beer, whiskey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 77, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": null, "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "5 milligrams", "sugarContent": null, "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bottle or pint of beer", "1 shot of whiskey of any kind"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour the beer into a glass, or just open the bottle."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour the whiskey into a shot glass.
