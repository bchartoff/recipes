{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Roast Chicken With Tangy Yogurt Sauce", "description": "This weeknight meal is inspired by the spiced chicken and rice that draws lines at halal street carts across Manhattan. Whether it\u2019s lunchtime or late at night, the scent and Mediterranean flavors of grilled and chopped chicken served over turmeric-tinged yellow rice (or wrapped in pita) alongside shredded iceberg salad lures a crowd. Everything gets an imperative, generous drizzle of that signature creamy and tangy white sauce, made here with a blend of yogurt, mayonnaise and spices. Fresh garlic, cilantro and lemon juice are combined with a tasty mix of fragrant spices, then rubbed all over the chicken before it\u2019s roasted until golden and crispy. The iceberg-and-tomato salad offers a cool, refreshing contrast to the spiced chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/16/dining/kc-halal-chicken/merlin_210913842_8fac12ba-26cf-4cd7-b1a8-e9b2988707d4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, lettuce, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 545}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon granulated onion", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus wedges for serving", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes", "Salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt (2 percent or whole-milk)", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar", "3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar", "A big pinch of granulated garlic", "A big pinch of granulated onion", "Salt and black pepper", "To Serve:", "1 small head iceberg lettuce, shredded", "2 medium tomatoes, diced", "Warm pita bread and hot sauce (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chicken: Heat oven to 450 degrees.
