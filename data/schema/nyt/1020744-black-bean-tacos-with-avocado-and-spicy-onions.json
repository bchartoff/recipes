{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Bean Tacos With Avocado and Spicy Onions", "description": "Spicy pickled onions add brightness and tang to these hearty black bean tacos. The filling is a bit like chili but without the tomato, and perfect to wrap up in a tortilla. You can make the black beans up to 5 days ahead; they even freeze well. Then just warm them up, along with the tortillas, right before serving. The spicy onions will last for weeks in the fridge. Use them on everything: soups, salads, even grilled cheese sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/31/dining/31lessmeat3/merlin_166281633_4c04e1be-a088-4a46-9eda-ba5b1ff60eee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, tacos, vegetables", "keywords": "black beans, red onion, tortilla, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 511}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lime", "1 small red onion or large shallot, thinly sliced", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and thinly sliced", "Large pinch of fine sea salt", "Small pinch of granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 large onion, chopped", "1/2 cup diced red or green bell pepper", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and minced", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1/2 tablespoon chili powder", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed", "Fine sea salt", "Corn tortillas, warmed", "1 avocado, peeled, pitted and sliced", "Fresh cilantro, salsa and sour cream, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the spicy onions: Squeeze the lime into a bowl and add the onion or shallot, jalape\u00f1o, salt and sugar to the juice.
