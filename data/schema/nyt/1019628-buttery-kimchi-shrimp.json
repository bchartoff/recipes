{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttery Kimchi Shrimp", "description": "Kimchi, a classic Korean dish of fermented vegetables, creates a subtle, funky sauce for sweet shrimp when stirred into melted butter. Some kimchis can be spicier than others, so taste yours before deciding if you want to add heat with red-pepper flakes. A good squeeze of lime juice just before serving gives the whole dish a bright lift and really brings it together, so don\u2019t even think about skipping it. Serve with saut\u00e9ed bok choy or tatsoi on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/ch-buttery-kimchi-shrimp/ch-buttery-kimchi-shrimp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "cilantro, kimchi, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 165}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 107, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "233 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup roughly chopped kimchi", "1 1/2 pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left on (16 to 20 shrimp)", "Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped ginger", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1/2 lime, for serving", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro", "Flaky salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, pulse the kimchi until it resembles a paste.
