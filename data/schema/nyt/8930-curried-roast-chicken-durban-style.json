The chicken is skinned before seasoning and cooking, not a demanding job but one that requires care. The fragrant heat of the chicken, which stayed moist thanks to its foil cocoon, even seemed to tease some spicy flavors from the Marcel Lapierre Morgon Beaujolais I poured with dinner. The fruitiness of the wine helped tame the heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/27/dining/Durban-Style/Durban-Style-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "chicken, ginger, lemon juice, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 143}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 626, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "771 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3 1/4-pound whole chicken, skinned", "1/4 cup lemon juice", "1 2-inch piece peeled ginger, chopped", "3 cloves garlic, chopped", "3 small fresh green chilies, chopped", "1 teaspoon salt", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon chili powder, preferably coarsely ground", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut two deep diagonal slits, down to the bone, in each chicken breast and one in each leg and thigh.
