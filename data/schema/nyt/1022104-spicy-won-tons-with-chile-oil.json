{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Won Tons With Chile Oil", "description": "Sichuan won tons are typically doused with hot, numbing chile sauce, but this less fiery version, adapted from \u201cHong Kong: Food City\u201d by Tony Tan, is more like what you\u2019d find at Cantonese restaurants. These delicate won tons are subtly sweet, ginger-scented and filled with a tender combination of pork, egg, stock, soy sauce and Shaoxing rice wine. Eat a couple of the won tons on their own to appreciate their delicate flavor before surrounding them with chile oil sauce, which will inevitably dominate them. Scale the amount of chile oil to suit your tolerance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/16/dining/aw-Spicy-Wontons-With-Chile-Oil/merlin_185308362_327bc082-bffc-49d3-ab48-7044e892d91b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "About 40 won tons", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, project", "keywords": "ground pork, lunar new year, red chiles, won-ton wrappers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 410}, "recipeIngredient": ["25 grams dried red chiles, preferably Sichuan or Tianjin chiles (about 3/4 cup)", "1/2 cup neutral oil, such as sunflower, canola or vegetable oil", "1/3 cup well-stirred chile oil, plus more to taste", "1/3 cup light soy sauce", "4 teaspoons toasted white sesame seeds", "4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped (about 2 tablespoons)", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns, lightly crushed", "1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more to taste", "10 ounces ground pork (at least 20 percent fat)", "1 large egg, beaten", "2 tablespoons finely chopped ginger", "1 tablespoon light soy sauce", "2 teaspoons Shaoxing rice wine", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons chicken stock (or water)", "About 40 (3 1/2-inch-wide) square won-ton wrappers (preferably yellow, Hong Kong-style)", "2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chile oil: Snip any stems off the chiles and discard any exposed seeds.
