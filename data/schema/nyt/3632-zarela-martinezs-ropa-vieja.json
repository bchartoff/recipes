Growing up in a tiny Arizona town among many Mexican neighbors, Ms. Schrambling learned early on of the rich flavors that can be coaxed from the simplest food. This ropa vieja, from the chef Zarela Martinez, embodies that philosophy. Garlic and peppercorns infuse a flank steak with flavor, which is then cooked shortly with a mixture of saut\u00e9ed garlic, onions and poblano peppers. Hot, tucked into a tortilla, it\u2019s a testament to the power of a long cook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Regina Schrambling"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/12/dining/Ropa-Vieja/Ropa-Vieja-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cuban", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, nut-free, flank steak, poblano pepper, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 85}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds flank steak", "1 1/2 cups water", "8 cloves garlic (6 whole and peeled, 2 sliced and peeled)", "6 whole black peppercorns", "Salt to taste", "8 fresh poblano peppers", "1/3 cup lard, bacon drippings or vegetable oil", "1 large onion, halved and sliced 1/8-inch thick", "Flour tortillas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the flank steak in half horizontally so it will fit into a large Dutch oven.
