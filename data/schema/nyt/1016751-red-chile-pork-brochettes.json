{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red Chile Pork Brochettes", "description": "Spicy red chile sauce, made with New Mexico red chile powder, is used as both a marinade and a dipping sauce for these small brochettes, which are ideal party food. They are best grilled outdoors over coals, but also work fine on a stovetop cast iron grill or under the broiler. Threading each piece of meat onto two skewers, rather than one, keeps the meat from twirling and makes it easier to grill. (If you\u2019re using bamboo skewers, soak them in warm water for 15 minutes, so they won\u2019t catch fire.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/19/dining/porkbrochette/porkbrochette-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 skewers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, skewers and kebabs", "keywords": "cumin, garlic, pork shoulder, red chili, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 41}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 283, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "356 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds well-marbled pork shoulder, cut into 3/4-inch slices", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons hot New Mexico red chile powder, more for seasoning meat (may substitute ancho or guajillo chile powder)", "1 large tomato, about 3/4 pound", "4 garlic cloves, mashed to a paste", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon toasted coarsely ground cumin"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut pork into 2-by-2-by-3/4-inch pieces.
