Finally, use it to pan-fry slices of halloumi and make this a vegetarian main course.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/dining/30oilrex2/30oilrex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings as an appetizer, 4 to 6 servings as an entree", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, cucumber, extra virgin olive oil, halloumi, olive oil, sourdough, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 168}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound slightly stale sourdough or country bread, thickly sliced", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt", "4 to 5 cups cucumber chunks, preferably thin-skinned, such as Kirby or Persian", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 to 3 pounds cherry tomatoes, halved, or ripe tomatoes, cored and cut into chunks", "8 to 12 ounces halloumi (see Tip)", "2 garlic cloves", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced red onion or scallions, plus more to taste", "2 to 3 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh mint or basil", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the croutons: Heat oven to 400 degrees.
