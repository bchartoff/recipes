{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mulled Cider With Cardamom, Black Pepper and Ginger", "description": "Traditional mulled cider is cozy and fragrant, but sometimes tastes a little too much like potpourri. In this version, toasted c<span>ardamom, allspice berries and black peppercorns provide sophisticated spiciness, while</span>\u00a0fresh ginger and citrus add fresh zing. It\u2019s a subtle but noticeable makeover, resulting in cider that\u2019s tangy and aromatic with a savory edge. If you want to spike it, don\u2019t pour the whiskey into the pot with the cider; the alcohol will burn off over the course of an hour or so. Instead, let guests add whiskey to their own mugs.
