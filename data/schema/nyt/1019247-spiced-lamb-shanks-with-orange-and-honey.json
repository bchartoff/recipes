{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Lamb Shanks With Orange and Honey", "description": "There are many ways to cook lamb shanks throughout the year, but these taste like the beginning of spring. The orange fragrance and the honey\u2019s perfume are complemented by the similarly sweet carrots and turnips. A shower of freshly snipped herbs adorns the dish just before serving. The recipe is easy to prepare in two parts: The shanks are simmered to tenderness first, which produces the broth. This can be done several hours ahead or up to 2 days in advance. Then, the bones are removed, and the meat can be finished in the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/04/dining/04Kitchen1/merlin_135562941_5167d051-66ab-4e31-93d9-687c9cebd046-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "arrowroot, carrot, honey, lamb shanks, orange, turnip, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 94}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 meaty lamb shanks (about 6 pounds total)", "Salt and pepper", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds", "1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds", "1 large onion, cut into thick slices", "2 whole cloves", "1 thyme sprig", "1 bay leaf", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "Salt and pepper", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "Pinch saffron", "Pinch cayenne", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 tablespoons honey", "Zest of 1 orange, peeled into wide strips", "1/2 cup orange juice", "1/2 cup white wine", "1 tablespoon arrowroot or cornstarch, dissolved in 2 tablespoons cold water", "2 tablespoons butter", "1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch batons", "1 pound turnips, peeled and cut into wedges", "Salt", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped mint", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped dill", "Handful of small basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the lamb shanks: Season shanks generously with salt and pepper.
