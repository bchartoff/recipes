{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb \u201cBig Crumb\u201d Coffeecake", "description": "Rhubarb is an alarmingly sour vegetable passed off as a fruit, but requiring a huge mound of sugar to effect the transformation. Crumb cake is a huge mound of sugar disguised as a cake, but demanding a bracing counterpoint to allay its cloying sweetness. In this cake, the two strike a perfect balance. The extra-large crumbs are made by pinching off marbles of brown sugar dough by hand. It takes a bit more time than pulsing the ingredients in a food processor, but the result is worth the extra effort.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/dining/big-crumb-coffee-cake/big-crumb-coffee-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, pastries", "keywords": "butter, cake flour, rhubarb, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 216}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 539, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "73 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "232 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter, for greasing pan", "1/2 pound rhubarb, trimmed", "1/4 cup sugar", "2 teaspoons cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/3 cup dark brown sugar", "1/3 cup granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "1/2 cup melted butter", "1 3/4 cups cake flour", "1/3 cup sour cream", "1 large egg", "1 large egg yolk", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 cup cake flour", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "6 tablespoons softened butter, cut into 8 pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
