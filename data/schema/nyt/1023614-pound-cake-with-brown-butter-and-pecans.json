{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pound Cake With Brown Butter and Pecans", "description": "This twist on a traditional pound cake takes the ordinary and turns it into something extraordinary, making the longtime favorite taste like a buttery, nutty maple-glazed doughnut. Beyond being delicious, it\u2019s also a great way to use up any pecans, rescuing them by toasting them and tossing them in a sweet glaze. (If you like, you can also use a mix of pecans and walnuts.) It\u2019s a big cake, great for a crowd, and a little goes a long way. But it keeps well in the fridge and is especially nice heated up for 15 seconds in the microwave.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/07/dining/mp-pound-cake/merlin_215733918_16b36cc7-07a4-44fa-82b9-1f8cea9ad6f4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "14 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "brown butter, buttermilk, cake flour, pecan, pound cake, sweetened condensed milk, christmas, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 30}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "3 cups plus 2 tablespoons/400 grams cake flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 cup/60 grams chopped pecans", "1 1/2 cups/339 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature", "1/2 cup unsalted butter", "1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "1 cup/102 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 cups/250 grams finely chopped pecans", "Whole milk (optional), for thinning glaze"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
