{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Chicken Salad With Green Beans, Capers and Olives", "description": "The key to a moist, juicy grilled boneless chicken breast is simple but crucial: Keep the heat moderate and don\u2019t overcook the chicken. Skin-on chicken is ideal. (It's not always easy to find; sometimes you\u2019ll see skin-on breasts that have breastbone and ribs attached, which you can easily remove. Or ask a butcher.) If boneless, skinless chicken is your only option, that\u2019s fine, but proceed with care and adjust the cooking time on the grill to about 3 minutes per side. Cook the chicken breasts just before making the salad and let them rest for a few minutes when they come off the grill, so juices can redistribute. Slice the meat on an angle while it\u2019s still slightly warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/03/dining/03KITCH1-WEB/03KITCH1-WEB-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "capers, chicken breast, dijon mustard, olives, romano beans, rosemary, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 176}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless chicken breasts, preferably skin-on, trimmed (about 6 ounces each)", "Salt and pepper", "Zest of 1 lemon", "1 teaspoon chopped rosemary", "1/2 teaspoon grated garlic", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon grated garlic", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon chopped capers", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and pepper", "1 cup pitted Ni\u00e7oise olives", "1/2 teaspoon grated garlic", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound small green beans or Romano beans, or a mixture, topped and tailed", "Salt and pepper", "4 hard-cooked eggs, quartered", "Green and black olives, for garnish (optional)", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish", "Handful of green or purple basil leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate the chicken: Season breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.
