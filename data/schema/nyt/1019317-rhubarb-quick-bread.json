{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb Quick Bread", "description": "Beautiful pink rhubarb at the markets signals spring's arrival. A bit sour on their own, the stalks work beautifully with sweet strawberries and blueberries, and citrus. This buttery loaf is made with a bit of orange zest, which perfectly compliments rhubarb\u2019s pleasant tang. Dress the cooled loaf with a simple glaze of confectioners\u2019 sugar and orange juice, if you like, or serve fat slices with vanilla ice cream. Leftovers are nice toasted in a skillet with plenty of salty butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/08/dining/08COOKING-RHUBARBQUICKBREAD1/08COOKING-RHUBARBQUICKBREAD1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads, quick breads", "keywords": "dessert, side dish, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 268}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 343, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "268 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted, plus more for the pan", "1 cup/200 grams plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon freshly grated orange zest", "1/3 cup whole-milk yogurt", "2 large eggs", "1 3/4 cup/223 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 3/4 cup/227 grams chopped rhubarb (8 ounces), cut into 1/4-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
