{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black-and-White Cupcakes", "description": "There\u2019s a lot to like in a little cupcake. There\u2019s the joy of having a cake all to yourself. The pleasure of getting creamy frosting and tender cake in every bite. And the fun of decorating, or not: Plain is good, too. This cupcake has two more things going for it: It\u2019s easy enough to make with kids or to have kids make themselves, and it\u2019s both childishly appealing and sophisticated \u2014 the cake is not very sweet and the chocolate frosting is deep and rich. There\u2019s enough frosting for each cupcake to be finished with a few thick swirls. If you have turret-type topknots in mind, multiply the recipe. Whatever you do, keep mixing the frosting after the cold butter goes in so that it thickens enough to spread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/26/magazine/26ondessert/26mag-26ondessert-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "18 cupcakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cake, chocolate chips, flour, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 125}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 316, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "131 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups (238 grams) all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "10 tablespoons (133 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 cup (200 grams) sugar", "3 large eggs", "1 large yolk", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "3/4 cup (180 milliliters) buttermilk, shaken", "1 cup (170 grams) mini chocolate chips", "9 ounces (255 grams) semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons confectioner\u2019s sugar, sifted", "6 tablespoons (85 grams) cold unsalted butter", "Sprinkles, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "To make the cupcakes:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds, and heat to 350 degrees.
