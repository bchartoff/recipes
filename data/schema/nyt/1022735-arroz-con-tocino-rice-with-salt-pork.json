{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arroz con Tocino (Rice With Salt Pork)", "description": "In Puerto Rico, rice is typically served at Thanksgiving. <a href =\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021694-arroz-con-gandules-puerto-rican-rice-with-pigeon-peas\">Arroz con gandules</a> is standard, and this twist on classic white rice is also a favorite. Salt pork or bacon is saut\u00e9ed until crisp, replacing the oil and salt that\u2019s usually added to white rice and giving this staple a decidedly porky essence. While Puerto Ricans often use a lightweight aluminum pot or caldero for rice dishes, a large, light, nonstick saucepan with a lid is a good replacement. Salt pork can vary in saltiness and funk, so rinse well and pat dry with a clean towel before dicing, and adjust the salt to taste. Do not wash the rice before cooking as it will make the rice retain moisture and become mushy. This quick, easy side dish pairs well with saucy beans, greens and stewed meats any day of the week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/08/dining/vd-arroz-con-tocino/merlin_197232366_62505aed-33d2-4a16-bcc4-4cddcb71204b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, side dish", "keywords": "puerto rican, salt pork, short grain rice, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 75}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 1/2 ounces salt pork or bacon, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces (about 1 cup)", "1 to 2 large garlic cloves, minced", "2 cups short grain rice or sushi rice\u00a0", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large saucepan with a lid over medium.
