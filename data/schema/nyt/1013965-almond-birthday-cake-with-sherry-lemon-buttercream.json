{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Almond Birthday Cake With Sherry-Lemon Buttercream", "description": "This is a layer cake with sophisticated flavors, fit for a grown-up\u2019s birthday celebration but sure to be devoured by party guests of all ages. The cake itself is made with finely ground almonds, sour cream and a touch of lemon zest. The frosting is buttercream with cinnamon for spice and yet more zest. When you\u2019re making the frosting, be sure to let the egg white mixture cool before adding the butter; the butter should not melt when it meets the whites, which would make for a greasy frosting. What you want is for the buttercream to be smooth and fluffy, an invitation to slice into the cake and take that first heavenly bite.
