Though most bars make it with London Dry gin, the earliest known recipe for the drink calls for Old Tom gin, a sweeter form of the spirit that was common in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This is the recipe found in \u201cDrinks,\u201d a 1913 book by the bartender Jacques Straub, and favored by Jim Kearns, an owner of Slowly Shirley, a cocktail bar in Greenwich Village. \"The orange bitters adds a nice, dry, citric note to the end, keeping the cocktail from becoming too sweet,\u201d Mr. Kearns said. While Straub\u2019s instructions do not call for a lemon twist, Mr. Kearns added it anyway, because it \u201ccomplements the orange bitters so nicely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/18/dining/18alaskarex/merlin_136424214_35ec02c0-18af-4610-9662-bcdfd632a7fe-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bitters, gin, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 113}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 234, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 ounces Old Tom gin, preferably Hayman\u2019s", "3/4 ounce yellow Chartreuse", "1 dash orange bitters", "Lemon twist, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing glass filled with ice, combine the gin, Chartreuse and bitters, and stir until chilled, about 30 seconds.
