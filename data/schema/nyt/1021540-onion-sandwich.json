{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Onion Sandwich", "description": "James Beard took this recipe from his colleagues Irma and Bill Rhode over 60 years ago, but there\u2019s something delicate, fresh and unfussy about the sandwich even now. There isn\u2019t much to it, so each component really matters: Slice the onions thinly and evenly, season well, and be gentle so you don\u2019t squish the bread as you press each sandwich shut. Rolling the edge of the sandwich in chopped parsley (or a mix of parsley and other fresh herbs), gives it a retro styling touch, but it\u2019s crucial for flavor, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/18/magazine/18Eat/18Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "12 mini sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, lunch, snack, finger foods, sandwiches, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "brioche, challah, herbs, mayonnaise, white onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 758}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 loaf challah or brioche, sliced about 1/4-inch thick", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "1 to 2 sweet white onions, such as Vidalia", "Crunchy sea salt, to taste", "1 cup fresh herbs, such as parsley, or a mix of parsley, tarragon and marjoram, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a 1 1/2-inch cutter, cut 24 rounds from the bread and arrange in 12 pairs.
