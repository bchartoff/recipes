I was at Casa Mono, in Manhattan, lapping up every drop of the sauce from a little cazuela of piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtails. The next day I was tasting Ribera del Duero wines (with the restaurant\u2019s wine director, as it happened) and could think of no better dish for them than those meaty, slightly fruity peppers with their alluring hint of bitterness.Andy Nusser, the chef at Casa Mono, provided the recipe, enough to feed the entire town of Pe\u00f1afiel. I made drastic cuts (four quarts of stock down to two cups, for example) but still had enough for a party. My freezer holds the bonus.
