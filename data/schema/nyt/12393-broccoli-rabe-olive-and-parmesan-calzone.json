{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broccoli Rabe, Olive and Parmesan Calzone", "description": "A calzone has many of the perks of pizza. Easy and crowd pleasing, it\u2019s a good vehicle for using up odds and ends in the fridge.\n\nIt also has some happy benefits of its own. For one, you can get away with adding a lot more cheese. In fact, it\u2019s practically mandatory. You need to stuff enough ricotta and mozzarella into the dough so that it ripples attractively, rising as it bakes. Unlike an apple turnover, which wants to stay flat, a calzone should peak and singe at the top. (True, you could cram the dough full of vegetables and the like, but if you love cheese, calzones are the place to indulge.)\n\nAnother calzone advantage is the element of surprise. Pizza gives it all up as soon as it lands on the table; serve a calzone to a group and let them anticipate the moment when they find out what\u2019s inside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/13/dining/video-clarkcalzone/video-clarkcalzone-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "broccoli rabe, pizza dough, ricotta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 914, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "75 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "47 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "1398 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, more as needed", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 bunch broccoli rabe, tough stems removed", "Kosher salt, as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "All-purpose flour, as needed", "1 8-ounce ball pizza dough, homemade or purchased", "1 cup fresh ricotta", "1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese", "3 ounces fresh mozzarella, sliced", "2 tablespoons pitted good black olives, thinly sliced", "Pinch red pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 500 degrees.
