{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Broccoli Rabe With Parmesan", "description": "Broccoli rabe usually doesn\u2019t make it past a saut\u00e9 pan with garlic and olive oil, nor does it need to. But the extra step of baking it in the oven with a shower of grated Parmesan on top \u2014 a suggestion from the chef John Schenk that was written up in a 1997 Minimalist column \u2014 is one to try. Blanch the broccoli rabe until it\u2019s bright green and nearly tender, then cook it in a pan with golden toasted garlic. From there, put it in a baking dish, sprinkle with cheese, and bake until it the cheese melts, which Parmesan does unevenly \u2014 but in a good way. This is a recipe that can easily be started, stopped and picked back up later, either after the blanching or after the saut\u00e9ing. It can also be served at room temperature, so despite the three-step cooking process, it\u2019s pretty flexible.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/10/dining/video-broccolirape/video-broccolirape-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 320}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 191, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "599 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "3 pounds broccoli rabe, washed and trimmed", "2 to 4 tablespoons olive oil, plus some for greasing the pan", "10 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced", "1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
