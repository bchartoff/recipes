Cook over medium heat until sugar melts and loses its sandlike consistency (there can still be a few sugar granules). Whisk in the coconut milk and a pinch of salt. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer until sauce reaches a consistency between that of heavy cream and butterscotch sauce; this could take 10 minutes or longer. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and lemon zest. Spoon sauce over pears and garnish with toasted coconut. Serve with the chocolate on the side."}]}
