{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gamja Salad With Cucumber, Carrot and Red Onion", "description": "Gamja (\u201cpotato\u201d) salad is likely to be included among a sea of other banchan at Korean restaurants, and is typically mounded on a plate using an ice cream scoop. It\u2019s similar to mashed potatoes in texture, mayo-laden like many potato salads, and studded with crunchy vegetables and hard-boiled egg. It\u2019s generally a restaurant food, but when home cooks do make it, the salad might be sandwiched between two slices of soft white bread and eaten for lunch. The world is your oyster when it comes to gamja salad: It may include apples, peas, corn kernels, raisins and even nuts, and you can add whatever you like and nix whatever you don\u2019t. But the cucumber is gibon (\u201cstandard\u201d), and essential, because it adds a vegetal freshness that pulls this dish back from feeling heavy in any way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/30/dining/28banchanrex2/merlin_177434079_a38762bd-5214-4e5c-8bb0-6d0985f60d9f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "carrot, cucumber, mayonnaise, potato, rice vinegar, russet potatoes", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 145}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 Kirby cucumber, deseeded and cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "1/2 medium red onion, very finely diced", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "1 large russet potato (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into 2-inch cubes", "1 large egg", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon mayonnaise (preferably Hellmann\u2019s)", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon rice vinegar", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine the cucumber, red onion and 1 teaspoon kosher salt.
