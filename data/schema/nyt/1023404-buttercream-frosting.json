{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttercream Frosting", "description": "American buttercream is simpler to make than its Swiss and Italian counterparts, which require cooking some of the ingredients, but it's no less tasty. Butter and confectioners\u2019 sugar are beaten until fluffy; heavy cream softens the texture and vanilla extract gives it dimension. It\u2019s leaner than other buttercreams, as it requires much less butter, but it\u2019s still luscious. You\u2019ll want to choose a flavorful butter to start, and make sure it\u2019s at the correct temperature. Room temperature butter should be soft enough to press into with a finger without seeming greasy. It will whip up nicely with the confectioners\u2019 sugar to create a fluffy, silky frosting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/07/dining/SSE-american-buttercream/merlin_212615952_cdc49e44-3f48-4a60-ac7c-50b28855d0a0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "About 2 1/4 cups (enough for one 8-inch 2-layer cake, one 9- by 13-inch cake or 12 cupcakes)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, frosting, make-ahead, raspberry preserves, vanilla extract", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 259}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/227 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "2 cups/246 grams confectioners' sugar, sifted", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "2 tablespoons heavy cream, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on low speed until combined.
