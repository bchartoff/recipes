Simultaneously use the back of a metal spatula to press the meat against the sides of the wok to char. Cook until the meat is browned but still lightly pink in the middle, about 7 minutes. (Avoid having the meat simply boil in the liquid fat.) Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to the prepared serving plate. Serve immediately with the lime-pepper dipping sauce."}]}
