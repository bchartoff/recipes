Cover with the basil leaves and arrange the tomato slices, the cucumber slices and then the garlic slices on top, distributing them evenly on both bread halves. Sprinkle with the pepper, salt and vinegar. Join both halves together and press the bread under a 5-to-6-pound weight for at least a few minutes, but longer if possible, to allow the vegetable juices to blend with the oil and seasonings. Cut into 6 large wedges and serve. This is an excellent lunch sandwich."}]}
