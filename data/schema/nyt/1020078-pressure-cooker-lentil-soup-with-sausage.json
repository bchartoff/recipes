(Other lentils may fall apart, but the soup will be no less delicious.) Determine your leafy green selection by what the market has to offer, keeping in mind that heartier types will retain more bite. Finish the soup with a hit of red-wine vinegar and a sprinkle of fresh basil for bright, fresh flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/05/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-lentil-soup/sd-pressure-cooker-lentil-soup-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "Garlic Powder, Italian Sausage, Lentil, Onion Powder, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 694}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 594, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1438 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Olive oil", "1 large red or yellow onion, chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound hot or sweet Italian sausage (pork, chicken or turkey), casing removed", "6 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "3 fresh thyme sprigs or 1 teaspoon dried thyme", "2 tablespoons fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried oregano", "Generous pinch of red-pepper flakes", "3/4 cup dry white wine", "1 (14-ounce) can whole or chopped tomatoes", "8 cups chicken stock", "2 cups dried lentils, preferably black beluga", "1 bay leaf", "5 ounces delicate leafy greens, such as baby spinach or baby kale, or 8 ounces hearty greens, such as chard or collards (stemmed and chopped), fresh or frozen", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "Chopped fresh basil, for serving", "Grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cover the bottom of a 5- to 8-quart pressure cooker with a thin layer of olive oil.
