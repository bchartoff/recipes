{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Creamy Pasta and Greens", "description": "In this recipe, frozen spinach, pasta and a whole lot of milk come together to create a satisfying pasta dish that will remind you of the best creamed spinach you\u2019ve ever had. Stir the mixture often and vigorously to help the pasta release its starch and create a rich sauce. The lemon peel provides a bright citrus flavor, but you can leave it out. If you\u2019d like a spicy version, add a dash of red-pepper flakes along with the shallot and garlic. You can also substitute different greens: Instead of frozen spinach, you can use 2 cups of chopped dark leafy greens, like chard or kale.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/15/dining/as-creamy-greens-and-pasta/merlin_180930000_8b2c32d3-747d-4bd2-8696-396d0b317a18-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "milk, parmesan, pasta, spinach, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 990}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 shallot, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "5 cups whole milk, plus more as needed", "10 ounces frozen chopped spinach", "2 wide lemon peel strips", "10 ounces ditalini, orzo or pearl couscous", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.
