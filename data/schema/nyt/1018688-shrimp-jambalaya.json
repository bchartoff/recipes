Just make a quick slurry of onion, bell pepper, ham, parboiled rice, garlic, cayenne, thyme and tomatoes. Let it simmer until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in the shrimp, cook for a few minutes, and voila. You're done, cher. Just don't forget to season well with salt and pepper and taste as you go.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05COOKING-BROWNRICEBELLPEPPERS2/05COOKING-BROWNRICEBELLPEPPERS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 187}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 349, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "892 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 cups diced onions", "2 cups diced bell pepper, preferably red or yellow", "1/2 cup chopped ham (optional)", "Salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 to 2 cups parboiled long-grain brown rice (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018695-parboiled-brown-rice\">see recipe</a>)", "2 tablespoons chopped garlic", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste", "Several sprigs fresh thyme", "2 cups peeled, seeded and chopped tomatoes (canned are fine; drain first)", "3 to 4 cups\u00a0shrimp\u00a0stock, other stock or water", "2 pounds\u00a0shrimp, peeled (and deveined, if you like) and cut into pieces if very large", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves or sliced scallions (or both), for garnish."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put olive oil in a medium casserole over medium heat.
