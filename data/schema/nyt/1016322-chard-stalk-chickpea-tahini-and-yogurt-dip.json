Then you can make this dip, which is a cross between hummus and  classic Middle Eastern dip called silqbiltahina, made with chard stalks and tahini. I\u2019ve added lots of yogurt to the mix. I love to use some red chard stalks because they give the dip a beautiful pale pink hue. This will keep for 3 or 4 days in the refrigerator. It will become more pungent as it sits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/03/science/07recipehealth/07recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "Makes about 3 cups, serving 10 to 12", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 21}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 107, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "167 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound Swiss chard stalks, sliced (about 2 1/2 cups)", "Salt to taste", "2 to 4 garlic cloves (to taste), peeled, green shoots removed", "1 can chickpeas (or 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas), drained and rinsed", "1/3 cup sesame tahini, stirred if the oil has separated", "1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt or drained plain yogurt (low-fat or whole)", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, to taste", "1/2 teaspoon lightly toasted cumin seeds, ground", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam chard stalks over 1 inch water until tender when pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
