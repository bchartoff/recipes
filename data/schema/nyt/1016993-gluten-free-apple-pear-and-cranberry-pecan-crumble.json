{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gluten-Free Apple, Pear and Cranberry Pecan Crumble", "description": "This has moved to the top of my favorite crumbles list. I have made apple crumbles before, but I hadn\u2019t cooked the apples first in my other recipes. It makes a huge difference in the sweetness and comfort level of the dish. The pear also contributes to the overall sweetness of the dessert and I love the tangy flavor of the dried cranberries. I have used a gluten-free mix of certified oats (produced in a gluten-free facility) and millet flour, which makes a crumble topping that is truly crumbly. Both tender apples like McIntosh, Gala, Macoun and Cortland, as well as firmer apples like Braeburns and Fujis work well in this dish", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/20/science/21recipehealth/21recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, snack", "keywords": "dessert, fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low-sodium, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 93}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 392, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "61 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups / 125 grams rolled oats", "1/2 cup / 70 grams quinoa flour or millet flour (grind quinoa or millet in a spice mill to make the flour)", "1/3 cup / 63 grams raw brown (turbinado) sugar", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon salt (to taste)", "3 ounces (6 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/4 cup / 30 grams pecans", "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "2 pounds / 900 grams / 4 large apples, peeled and cut in approximately 1/2-inch dice (see note)", "2 tablespoons / 60 grams unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons  / 30 grams raw brown (turbinado) sugar", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg", "1 large ripe but firm pear, peeled, cored and diced", "1 cup / 60 grams dried cranberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make crumble topping first.
