{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Trifle With Berries or Citrus", "description": "Trifles are as adaptable as desserts get. As long as you have layers of cake, custard, some kind of fruit or jam, and a fluffy cloud of whipped cream on top, they make festive desserts that you can vary as much as you like. While most trifles are boozy \u2014 the cake soaked with sherry or other spirits \u2014 orange juice makes a fine alternative, especially if you pair it with syrupy sugared orange segments. Or go more traditional, and use berries and sherry. This trifle is more about the interplay of soft vanilla-scented custard, whipped cream and fruit, with only one layer of cake at the bottom of the dish. If you\u2019d like a higher cake-to-custard ratio, add more ladyfingers as directed in Step 9. And don\u2019t neglect the garnish. Topping the trifle with sliced almonds or amaretti lends crunch and looks pretty, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/16/dining/11apperex/merlin_180930069_5941ee28-f525-45fd-a147-ad8152565adb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "parfaits and trifles, dessert", "keywords": "berries, cream, ladyfingers, orange, sherry, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 354}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "2 1/2 tablespoons/20 grams cornstarch", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "4 egg yolks", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters whole milk", "Optional flavorings: 1 teaspoon orange or lemon zest, 1 cinnamon stick or 6 cardamom pods", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups berries or 3 oranges (a mix of blood oranges and navel is pretty)", "1 to 2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "About 6 to 8 ladyfingers (also called Savoiardi or boudoir biscuits, or use sponge cake or poundcake), plus more if desired", "Berry jam or orange marmalade", "1/4 cup sherry, Madeira, dessert wine, brandy or orange juice, plus more as needed", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 tablespoon confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Sliced almonds, candied citrus peel, crumbled amaretti or berries, for garnish\u00a0(optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the custard: In a large bowl, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt.
