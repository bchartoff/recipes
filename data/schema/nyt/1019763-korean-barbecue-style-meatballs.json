{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Korean Barbecue-Style Meatballs", "description": "These meatballs, inspired by traditional Korean barbecue, bring the savory-sweet flavors of caramelized meat without the need for a grill. As the meatballs bake, the soy sauce marries the garlic and scallions to create a glaze. This meatball mixture can be made ahead and left to marinate in the fridge for 3 hours or even overnight. Use ground beef that is 85 percent lean meat, 15 percent fat, or 80 percent lean and 20 percent fat for juicier meatballs. The Ritz crackers here make for a more tender meatball, but feel free to substitute plain dry bread crumbs. The meatballs are tasty on their own, but for a simple dipping sauce, combine 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar. Serve over steamed rice with kimchi, or as a sandwich with mayonnaise or marinara sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/10/dining/kc-korean-bbq-beef/kc-korean-bbq-beef-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, meatballs", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, ground beef, ritz crackers, scallions, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1206}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 255, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "410 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup chopped scallions", "2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup finely crushed Ritz crackers (12 crackers)", "1 pound ground beef (round or chuck)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
