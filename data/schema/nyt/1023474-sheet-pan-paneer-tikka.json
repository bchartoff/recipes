{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Paneer Tikka", "description": "Paneer, the slightly salty and extremely versatile South Asian cheese, is the perfect backdrop for heady masalas. In this recipe, soaking paneer in hot water for 10 minutes before cooking rehydrates it, while coating and baking it \u2014 along with bell peppers and red onion \u2014 with yogurt, ginger, garlic, oil, and spices means the paneer will be light, fluffy and flavorful every time. Basting the paneer with melted ghee toward the end of the baking process keeps it from drying out and adds nuttiness. In the end, you\u2019ll have a one-pan meal of sweet, crunchy veggies and luxuriously spiced paneer in under 30 minutes. To make it vegan, substitute tofu for paneer (no need to soak) and skip the yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zainab Shah"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/13/dining/zs-paneer-tikka/merlin_213112764_77cf77a4-1108-4ba9-b98c-05a172afbad8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, curries, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, garam masala, ground turmeric, paneer, red onion, sheet-pan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 674}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds paneer (fresh or store-bought), cut into 1-inch cubes", "3 tablespoons mustard oil or neutral oil", "3 tablespoons full-fat Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon ginger paste or finely grated ginger (from about a 2 inch piece)", "1 tablespoon garlic paste or finely grated garlic (from about 6 cloves)", "1 tablespoon coriander powder", "1 tablespoon garam masala", "1 teaspoon Kashmiri or other red chile powder", "\u00bd teaspoon turmeric powder", "Salt", "2 medium bell peppers, seeded and chopped into 1-inch pieces", "1 medium red onion, quartered and each quarter cut into halves", "2 tablespoons melted ghee or butter for basting", "\u00bd lemon, juiced (about 4 teaspoons)", "Roti and chutney, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using store-bought paneer, soak it in hot water for 10 minutes and drain.
