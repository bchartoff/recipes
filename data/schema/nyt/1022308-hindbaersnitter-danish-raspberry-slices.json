{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hindbaersnitter (Danish Raspberry Slices)", "description": "Glazed and dotted with sprinkles, this Danish treat sandwiches raspberry jam between two buttery cookie layers \u2014 and has Pop-Tarts vibes. Popular in bakeries across Denmark, it\u2019s achievable at home because it\u2019s assembled in one large piece. For this recipe from \u201cScandiKitchen: Fika and Hygge\u201d by Bront\u00eb Aurell, the author recommends a not-too-thick layer of good-quality jam: \u201cGo for intense flavor instead of volume.\u201d Traditionally, these cookies are made with raspberry jam and cut into squares, but they invite experimentation. Slice them into rectangles or triangles; opt for other bright, tangy preserves; and decorate them liberally, adding color to the icing and sprinkling with chopped freeze-dried fruit, crystallized ginger or toasted nuts. Their nostalgic charm will still shine through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/11/dining/aw-raspberry-slices1/aw-raspberry-slices-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 12 to 15 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bar cookie, christmas cookie, danish, make-ahead, raspberries, raspberry jam, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 802}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 tablespoons/200 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes", "2 1/2 cups/350 grams all-purpose flour", "1 packed cup/125 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large egg", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/200 grams raspberry jam, jelly or preserves", "2 cups/250 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 tablespoons hot water, plus more as needed", "Finely chopped or crushed dried raspberries, or sprinkles, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a medium bowl, toss together the butter and flour.
