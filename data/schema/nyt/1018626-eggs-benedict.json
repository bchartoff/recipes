{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggs Benedict", "description": "Decadence is what makes eggs Benedict a star of the brunch table. To get there, order and timing are key. First, you'll want to make your hollandaise. While intimidating in theory, the process is a lot like making mayonnaise. If the emulsion is stable, it won't break, even when held at room temperature. Next, poach your eggs, and toast the English muffins while you crisp up the Canadian bacon. From there, it's as simple as stacking your ingredients and sprinkling them with herbs, salt and pepper. Once you\u2019ve mastered this basic version, you can explore its variations: Add sliced avocado, or even swap in some smoked salmon (eggs Hemingway) or wilted greens for the Canadian bacon (eggs Florentine).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/ar-eggs-benedict/ar-eggs-benedict-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "bacon, canadian bacon, chives, dill, eggs, ham, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 699}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 766, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "59 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "sodiumContent": "996 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter", "3 large egg yolks", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne or hot paprika, plus more to taste", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon white distilled vinegar", "Kosher salt", "8 large eggs", "4 English muffins, split", "8 slices Canadian bacon or thick-cut ham (or 8 slices regular, thick-cut bacon)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup chopped chives", "2 tablespoons chopped dill, tarragon or parsley", "Flaky sea salt", "Coarsely ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the hollandaise: Melt butter in a small pot over medium heat until it\u2019s foamy but not yet beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place egg yolks and 2 teaspoons water in a blender.

Repeat with remaining eggs \u2014 you could probably do up to four at a time. Check the eggs after 4 minutes: Use a slotted spoon to lift an egg out of the water, and feel the white for firmness. If it's not quite done, slide it back in for another minute or so. Let cook until the whites are just set, but the yolks are still completely runny, 4 to 5 minutes.
