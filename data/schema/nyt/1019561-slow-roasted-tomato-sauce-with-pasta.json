By roasting them in a low oven for a few hours, you\u2019re effectively adding umami to an already umami-packed ingredient. Well, the oven is. You\u2019re not doing a thing except boiling some pasta, and eventually, marveling at how such a rich red sauce came from such humble, any-season ingredients.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/13/dining/as-slow-roasted-tomato-sauce/as-slow-roasted-tomato-sauce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, lunch, quick, weekday, pastas, vegetables", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, hot sauce, pasta, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 142}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 610, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "100 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "699 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (28-ounce) cans whole, peeled tomatoes", "6 garlic cloves, peeled", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 teaspoons hot sauce of choice (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 pound mezze rigatoni, penne or other tubular\u00a0pasta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
