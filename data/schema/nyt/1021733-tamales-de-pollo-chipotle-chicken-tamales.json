Ms. Villanueva shared her recipe with Leticia Landa and Caleb Zigas for their cookbook \u201cWe Are La Cocina.\u201d Her tamales are made with corn masa flour that\u2019s softened and flavored at the same time with both fat and broth. The recipe is a project, but once you\u2019ve done the work of preparing the husks, filling and masa, the process of filling and wrapping the tamales goes quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/23/dining/18Tamalesrex4-chicken/merlin_181221105_51e97f8a-b262-454c-9d69-7cc170ab4d7e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H15M", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 tamales", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "christmas, corn husk, harina de ma\u00edz nixtamalizado, lard", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 198}, "recipeIngredient": ["20 dried corn husks (from about 8 ounces)", "3 1/2 cups/410 grams harina de ma\u00edz nixtamalizado (such as Maseca)", "1 teaspoon fine salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "6 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil", "2 1/2 to 3 cups <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021734-tinga-de-pollo-chicken-with-chipotle-and-onions\">chicken broth</a>  or water", "1 1/2 cups <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021734-tinga-de-pollo-chicken-with-chipotle-and-onions\">Tinga de Pollo</a>"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the corn husks in a large bowl and add enough warm water to cover.

Use your fingers or a palette knife to spread a handful of masa (about 1/4 cup) in the center of the husk, covering about two-thirds of the husk with masa about 1/4-inch thick. Leave at least 3 inches clear at the pointed end and at least an inch on the other sides. Put 1 heaping spoonful of the chicken tinga filling lengthwise down the center of the masa. Wrap by bringing the right side of the dough over the filling and folding in half. Continue rolling tightly to the long end of the husk, then fold the pointed bottom end over the tamal towards the open top. Set aside folded ends down. Repeat with the remaining ingredients."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a large steamer by setting a steamer insert or rack above gently boiling water. Stack the tamales flat seam side down on the insert, leaving an empty space in the center. Cover with remaining husks, then the lid. Steam, replenishing the water as needed, until the tamales are firm and the masa comes away easily from the husk, about 45 to 55 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm in the steamer until ready to serve. Steamed and cooled tamales can be wrapped individually and frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and steam until heated through to serve."}], "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021733-tamales-de-pollo-chipotle-chicken-tamales"}
