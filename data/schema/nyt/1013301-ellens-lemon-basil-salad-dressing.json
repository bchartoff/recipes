{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ellen\u2019s Lemon Basil Salad Dressing", "description": "Ellen Greenblatt, a friend who lives in Berkeley, Calif., shared this recipe with me. Toss a green salad with this dressing, and no additional herbs will be necessary. It is perfect for chicken salad or drizzled over a cooked chicken breast; use it over shrimp, salmon or sliced tomatoes. Ms. Greenblatt uses a mini food processor, but the dressing also can be made in a mortar and pestle. Try it on some of the salads in the Recipes for Health index.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/13/science/12recipehealth/12recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1/2 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "basil, honey, gluten-free, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 109}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 195, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "81 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 1/3 cup fresh basil leaves", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "Salt", "lots of freshly ground black pepper", "2 to 3 teaspoons mild honey (to taste)", "6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the basil in the bowl of a mini food processor and pulse until finely chopped.
