{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Broccoli With Vinegar-Mustard Glaze", "description": "On its own, roasted broccoli is a treat: caramelized and crisp-tender, with frizzled florets and sweet stems. To prevent overcooking, roast at a high heat and on one side the whole time. Flipping the broccoli to brown on both sides increases the chance that it will dry out or turn to mush before the outsides are as caramelized as you like. To give the broccoli a little pizzazz, this recipe takes inspiration from a classic <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/4424-chicken-in-mustard-sauce\">mustard pan sauce</a>,</span> which makes chicken breasts or steaks sparkle. Toss the broccoli with butter, vinegar and Dijon mustard right out of the oven, and the heat from the sheet pan will meld them into a silky, bright sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/18/dining/as-roasted-broccoli/merlin_183942432_a90f4069-81c5-4092-a9e3-6ec4407a19fd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "broccoli, dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, sherry vinegar, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2429}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds broccoli, cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch-long florets, stems sliced 1/4-inch thick", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon sherry or red wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
