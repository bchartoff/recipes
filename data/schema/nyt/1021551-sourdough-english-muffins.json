{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sourdough English Muffins", "description": "Bring a little tang to classic English muffins with this naturally leavened dough, which develops deeper flavor thanks to a longer fermentation than most sourdough breads. While most English muffin recipes call for dairy for tenderness, this one gets its texture \u2014 and flavor \u2014 from the spongy sourdough, and a final steaming to achieve that quintessentially soft exterior. Take your breakfast sandwich or tuna melt game up a notch with these big and fluffy stovetop muffins.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Laurie Ellen Pellicano"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/16/dining/lep-sourdough-english-muffins/lep-sourdough-english-muffins-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 (4-inch) muffins", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, breads, side dish", "keywords": "flour, honey, polenta, sourdough starter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 516}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup/150 grams sourdough starter", "1 1/4 cups/300 grams room temperature water (see Tip)", "2 tablespoons honey", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "4 cups/525 grams unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "Polenta or coarse cornmeal, for dusting", "Neutral oil, for greasing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The morning before you want to enjoy your English muffins, prepare your dough: In a large measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk together starter, water, honey and oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Select a container or bowl that will hold at least 3 quarts, as this dough will grow 3 to 4 times in size.
