I love the way basil interacts with grapefruit (I often chiffonade a few leaves to festoon a broiled grapefruit half at breakfast), so I\u2019ve found that muddling a segment of the fruit with a few bright, fresh basil leaves is a good foundation for a Paloma. And as with the margarita, you may opt for salt on the rim of your glass \u2014 or not.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/20/dining/summerdrinks-paloma/summerdrinks-paloma-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 13}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 basil leaves", "1 grapefruit segment", "2 ounces silver tequila", "Juice of 1/2 lime", "1/2 ounce simple syrup", "3 ounces grapefruit juice", "Soda water", "Lime wedge, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put 2 basil leaves and 1 grapefruit segment in a highball glass and muddle gently.
