{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Zucchini Pasta", "description": "This recipe transforms two pounds of grated fresh zucchini into one cup of caramelized zucchini that\u2019s rich, sweet and jammy enough to become a pasta sauce. Cooked over moderately high heat in a combination of olive oil and butter, the zucchini fries in its own juices and concentrates its flavor. Adding garlic and basil lends sweetness, but consider adding anchovy, preserved lemon or red-pepper flakes. As browned bits appear in the skillet, deglaze with a few tablespoons of water, chicken stock or vegetable stock to help prevent burning and to incorporate all of those tasty caramelized bits into the sauce. With time and patience, you\u2019ll have a not-so-pretty but delicious mixture, like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020107-french-onion-grilled-cheese\">caramelized onions</a> made with zucchini. Eat it tossed with pasta, as is done here, or add it to sandwiches, pizzas or antipasti spreads. \n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/06/dining/as-caramelized-zucchini-pasta/merlin_192092256_44c23e41-ce25-4137-ac0d-651b194f2ddf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cast iron, pasta, zucchini, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3507}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 pounds zucchini, coarsely grated (about 3 large zucchini)", "8 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "1/2 cup basil leaves, stems reserved, plus more for serving\u00a0", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound ridged or curly pasta (like medium shells or casarecce)", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan or pecorino (about 1/2 ounce), plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon lemon juice\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (at least 12-inch) cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter and oil.
