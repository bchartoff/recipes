{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Seared Pork Chops With Sage, Dates and Parsnips", "description": "This easy dish combines sage, brown butter and dates for a blast of sweet-salty flavor. Brining the pork chops in advance ensures tenderness: You can allow them to sit in the thyme-infused brine overnight, but even two hours of marinating will improve the taste and texture of the chops. This recipe calls for parsnips, but sweet potato or roasted squash would also work well. (And if you can\u2019t find medjool dates, pitted prunes are a worthy stand-in.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/02/dining/28tanisrex2-chops/merlin_200578218_95aa457c-47ce-4fcd-ad68-6dbf3afbdebb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "brown butter, dates, parsnip, pork chop, sage", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 123}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more for boiling", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 large thyme sprig", "4 bone-in pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick (about 2 pounds)", "2 pounds parsnips, peeled and cut into 3-inch sticks", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "4 tablespoons salted butter", "12 large sage leaves", "12 pitted medjool dates, halved", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "1/2 lemon, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brine the chops: Put salt and sugar in a large bowl.
