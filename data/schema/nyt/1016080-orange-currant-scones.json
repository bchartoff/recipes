{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orange-Currant Scones", "description": "The orange zest and currants in these tender scones are an homage to the chef Judy Rodgers of the Zuni Cafe in San Francisco, who made her storied scones until 1997. The dough and method here, though, are adapted from Heather Bertinetti, the pastry chef at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York. The genius of this particular scone recipe is in the geometry. Slicing a rolled-out slab of dough into squares or rectangles is infinitely simpler than cutting out rounds \u2014 and there's less chance of toughening the dough by re-rolling it and adding more flour. You can use any kind of chopped dried fruit in place of the currants.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/22/multimedia/recipelab-scones/recipelab-scones-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 scones", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, quick", "keywords": "currants, orange, scones, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 335}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "Freshly grated zest of 1 orange or tangerine", "1/4 pound (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cubed", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 cup currants, or use raisins, dried cranberries or small chunks of other dried fruit", "Egg wash (2 large eggs beaten with 1 tablespoon water)", "2 tablespoons brown sugar, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
