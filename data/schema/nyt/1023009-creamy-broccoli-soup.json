{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Broccoli Soup", "description": "This is one of the best formulas for a creamy, savory broccoli soup \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t include any cream. Borrowing from the concept of using coconut water to provide the kind of richness that is reminiscent of bone broth in <a href=\"https://food52.com/recipes/78595-yi-jun-loh-s-one-pot-coconut-water-abc-soup\">Yi Jun Loh\u2019s ingeniously vegan Malaysian ABC soup</a>, this simple green elixir starts with a base of umami-loaded vegetables seared in olive oil then braised in coconut water. With silken tofu providing creaminess, this verdant, vegetable-powered soup can be pleasurably contrasted, in flavor and in temperature, with an optional dollop of sweet, cool ricotta. (If you\u2019re keeping this vegan, you\u2019ll still have plenty of creamy richness even if you leave the ricotta out.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/28/dining/EK-creamy-broccoli-soup/merlin_196519890_06630323-269e-41bd-a8e5-fe3280c7e0e9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, soups and stews, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "broccoli, coconut water, healthy, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1212}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds broccoli", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 large onion, coarsely chopped", "1 medium carrot, coarsely chopped", "1 medium tomato, coarsely chopped", "1 small sweet potato (preferably white-fleshed), coarsely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 quart unsweetened coconut water, plus more if desired", "1 (16-ounce) container silken tofu, drained", "Ricotta, for serving (optional)", "Finely chopped parsley, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut off the broccoli stems, then cut the stems into 1-inch-thick slices.
