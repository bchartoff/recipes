{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Chili", "description": "Rather than browning the meat first, which doesn\u2019t do much for lean ground turkey and can actually make it tough, this recipe prioritizes cooking down the vegetables first. Onions and canned tomatoes fried in olive oil provide an umami-rich flavor base for turkey\u2019s blank canvas, and the adobo sauce from canned chipotle peppers does a lot of this dish\u2019s heavy lifting. Optional toppings like shredded cheese and sour cream help cool down the spice. One of the best ways to enjoy this simple but powerful chili is over French fries with melted cheese, or tossed with some cooked spaghetti. It\u2019s so great on its own, as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/22/dining/21beginner-rex3/merlin_208160682_1ced84e3-d8cb-4f26-aa66-76a8e086362b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, chipotles in adobo, ground turkey, super bowl, tailgate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1158}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large white onion, diced", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes", "Salt", "2 tablespoons chili powder", "1 pound ground turkey", "1 (7-ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce", "Shredded extra-sharp Cheddar, sour cream and whole cilantro leaves, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
