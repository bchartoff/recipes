{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gruy\u00e8re and Black Pepper Scones", "description": "A generous amount of Gruy\u00e8re and toasty walnuts give these scones a savory richness, which is surprising and delicious. The little cubes of cheese melt into the dough as it bakes, but some sneak out the sides, creating irresistible bits of fricolike crispy cheese. To make the most of your time, you can toast the walnuts on a sheet pan in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes while it\u2019s heating, just until they\u2019re golden and fragrant. Chives freshen up the mix, but chopped fresh thyme or rosemary would work well, too. Eat the scones warm for maximum enjoyment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/01/dining/ya-gruyere-and-black-pepper-scones/ya-gruyere-and-black-pepper-scones-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 scones", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack", "keywords": "black pepper, butter, buttermilk, gruy\u00e8re, scone, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 528}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, plus more for finishing", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter, cold and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "3 1/2 ounces/100 grams Gruy\u00e8re cheese, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces", "3/4 cup/65 grams toasted walnuts, chopped", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives\u00a0", "1 cup/105 grams cold buttermilk, plus more as needed\u00a0", "Flaky salt\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 400 degrees.
