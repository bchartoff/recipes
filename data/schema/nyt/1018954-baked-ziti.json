{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Ziti", "description": "This baked ziti is layered almost like a lasagna to ensure every bite has enough creamy ricotta, stringy mozzarella and tangy tomato sauce. But the key to its success comes from undercooking the pasta during the initial boil so it stays perfectly al dente, even after a trip to the oven. Heavy cream is added to prevent the ricotta from becoming grainy or dry during baking, letting it be its most luscious self. While this baked ziti is meatless (there\u2019s plenty of richness from the cheese \u2014 three types, to be exact), you could always incorporate a bit of sausage, ground meat or pancetta, if you like. Simply add 1/2 pound to the onions while saut\u00e9eing and proceed with the recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/20/dining/ar-baked-ziti/ar-baked-ziti-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, mozzarella, parmesan, pasta, ricotta, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2924}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 682, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "983 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "4 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, packed in juice", "1 (28-ounce) can tomato pur\u00e9e or sauce", "3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)", "16 ounces/1 pound ricotta", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan or Pecorino, plus more for grating on top", "1 pound ziti, rigatoni, penne, manicotti or other short, tubelike pasta", "1 pound fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the tomato sauce: Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.
