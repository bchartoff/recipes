{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame-Crusted Pork Cutlets With Cabbage", "description": "Do you ever wish that the crackly outside of your fried cutlet tasted like \u2014 anything? Instead of throwing a bunch of garlic or even Cheetos into the coating, swap bread crumbs for a something that\u2019s probably already in your pantry. By crusting your pounded-thin pork with crushed sesame seeds and shallow-frying for just a few minutes, each bite of juicy pork has a snap and crackle racing through, in addition to deep sesame flavor. To cut through the richness, take a cue from pork tonkatsu and serve these with extra-crisp wisps of cabbage and lemon. With such a minimalist ingredient list and process, you might think you need to add a thing or two, but everything you need is right here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/12/dining/as-sesame-pork-horizontal/as-sesame-pork-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weekday, steaks and chops", "keywords": "cabbage, pork loin, sesame seeds, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 31}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1061, "unsaturatedFatContent": "72 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "99 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "730 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups finely shredded green cabbage", "1 1/4 cups white sesame seeds", "6 (5-ounce) slices boneless pork loin or boneless pork chops", "Kosher salt", "1\u00bd to 2\u00bd  cups canola, vegetable or peanut oil", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Submerge the cabbage in a large bowl of ice water to crisp while you make the pork."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the sesame seeds in a large resealable plastic bag and pound using a rolling pin or skillet until coarsely crushed (alternatively, you can use a mortar and pestle).
