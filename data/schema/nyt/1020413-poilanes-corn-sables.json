These corn shortbread-style cookies, known as sabl\u00e9s in French, fit into that category perfectly. They\u2019re made with all-purpose flour and corn flour \u2013 corn ground so fine that you can barely feel a bit of grit when you rub a little between your fingers. (Do not use cornmeal or cornstarch.) Baked, the cookies have the characteristic sandiness of sabl\u00e9s and the beautiful golden color of corn. To get the best texture, make sure your butter is soft and creamy. The dough is a pleasure to work with and, because it holds its shape when baked, a good choice for fanciful cutouts. At Poil\u00e2ne, the cookies are always cut into simple rounds, so that, as Apollonia says, \u201cthey look like minisuns.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/25/magazine/25mag-eat/25mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 60 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "butter, corn flour, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/125 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/250 grams unsalted butter (2 1/4 sticks), cut into cubes, softened until creamy", "2 cups/240 grams corn flour", "1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/240 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, working with a mixer on medium speed, beat the sugar, egg and egg yolk until pale and creamy, about 2 minutes.
