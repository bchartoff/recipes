{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Rhubarb Cobbler", "description": "In this buttery cobbler, slices of rhubarb are roasted with sugar before rounds of biscuit dough are added to the pan. This extra step allows the rhubarb juices to condense into a sweet-tart syrup and eliminates the need for a thickener like cornstarch or tapioca, which can muddy the flavors. The result is a bright-tasting, flaky cobbler that\u2019s gently scented with vanilla and a little orange zest. Topped with a drizzle of heavy cream or a scoop of ice cream, it makes a rose-tinged dessert that\u2019s both lighter and bolder than others of its kind.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/21/dining/16apperex/merlin_186367155_2c056245-c2c2-4626-9bfd-2c83f9f305d3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "cobbler, crumble, and crisp, rhubarb, vanilla, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1231}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise (or use 1/2 teaspoon vanilla paste or 1 tablespoon vanilla extract)", "2 pounds rhubarb, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 7 cups)", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest", "Pinch of kosher salt", "3/4 cups/96 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for shaping", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "Pinch of kosher salt", "3 tablespoon cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1/3 cup/79 milliliters plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream, plus more for serving, if you like", "Demerara sugar, for sprinkling", "Ice cream, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
