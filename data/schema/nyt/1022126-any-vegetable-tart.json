{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Any Vegetable Tart", "description": "Perfect for casual entertaining, this rustic tart can be tailored to whatever vegetables you have on hand. The key here is to use either precooked vegetables, or quick-cooking raw vegetables that won\u2019t release too much liquid as they bake, making the pastry soggy. (See Tips below, for more.) So the crust tastes like a buttery cheese straw, an optional layer of grated Gruy\u00e8re or Cheddar is scattered onto the bottom of the baking pan before the dough is placed on top. The whole tart bakes up golden brown, savory and wonderfully crunchy. Serve this on the same day it\u2019s baked for maximum flakiness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/28/dining/23apperex2/merlin_186703842_1d5fc126-1dad-4fff-85e1-63e34980e1e6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "mother\u2019s day, parmesan, puff pastry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 363}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup shredded Gruy\u00e8re or Cheddar (optional)", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest or finely chopped rosemary", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or crushed to a paste (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or mascarpone", "All-purpose flour, for dusting the work surface", "1 (14-ounce) package puff pastry, preferably made with butter, thawed if frozen, but still cold", "2 to 3 cups sliced vegetables (see Tip)", "4 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced (reserve the dark green parts, for garnish, if you like)", "4 thyme or rosemary sprigs", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Microgreens, torn soft herbs or baby lettuces, for serving", "Lemon or lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 425 degrees.
