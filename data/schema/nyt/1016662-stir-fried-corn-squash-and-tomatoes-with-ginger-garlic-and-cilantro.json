With a big bunch of Thai basil in hand, I wanted a sweet stir-fry with Thai flavors. I stir-fried the vegetables in coconut oil, and I loved the results. The medley has that coconut fragrance without the heaviness it would have with coconut milk. I served the vegetables with black rice, which was beautiful, but any other rice, noodles or grains like quinoa would work. Make sure that your corn is sweet and your tomatoes are juicy. You can also use the lower-priced tomatoes \u201cfor sauce\u201d that may be at your farmers\u2019 market.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/16/science/15recipehealth/15recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, vegan, vegetarian, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 59}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 115, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "553 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup vegetable stock, chicken stock or water", "1 to 2 tablespoons soy sauce (to taste)", "2 teaspoons cornstarch", "2 tablespoons coconut oil", "1 red onion, cut in half lengthwise and sliced across the grain in half-moons", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "2 zucchini or similar summer squash (about 10 to 12 ounces), diced", "Kernels from 2 ears sweet corn", "1 pound ripe tomatoes, diced (about 2 1/2 cups)", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon sugar (to taste)", "1/4 cup chopped Thai basil", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine stock or water, soy sauce and cornstarch in a small bowl or measuring cup and stir to dissolve cornstarch.
