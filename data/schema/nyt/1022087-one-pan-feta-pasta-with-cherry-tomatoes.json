{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pan Feta Pasta With Cherry Tomatoes", "description": "In 2018, the Finnish blogger <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/liemessa/\">Jenni Hayrinen</a> posted <a href=\"https://liemessa.fi/2020/09/baked-feta-pasta-original-recipe/\">a recipe</a> for baked feta pasta. The dish became a full-on TikTok sensation, popular to the point that supermarkets were selling out of feta. This version streamlines her recipe. Instead of cooking the pasta separately, it\u2019s added to the casserole dish with the baked feta and tomatoes, turning it into a cozy one-pan meal. (Also note that you\u2019ll need an electric kettle to boil the water. So maybe it\u2019s more like a one-and-a-half-pan meal.) Don\u2019t think of this as a pasta dish in an Italian, al-dente sense. It\u2019s more like a creamy casserole along the lines of mac and cheese. In any case, it\u2019s comforting and supremely easy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/18/dining/mp-feta-pasta/mp-feta-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, weeknight, one pot, pastas, main course", "keywords": "basil, cherry tomatoes, farfalle, feta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1943}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pints cherry tomatoes", "5 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole", "5 thyme sprigs", "2 rosemary sprigs", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "8 ounces feta", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for serving", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "12 ounces short pasta, such as farfalle, campanelle, rotini or cavatappi", "3 cups boiling water", "1 cup torn basil leaves", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
