{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Easy Vegan Peanut Butter-Maple Ice Cream", "description": "With a flavor like the inside of a peanut butter cup and a plush, velvety texture, this four-ingredient ice cream is one of the easiest, most satisfying dairy-free recipes of its kind. The key is to use unsweetened oat creamer as the base. Not only does it have a neutral flavor and thick texture, but its starches also help keep iciness at bay. Simmering the maple syrup to eliminate excess water is another trick to enhance creaminess, and the concentrated maple flavor is delightful. A topping of chocolate shavings or sprinkles is optional, but really drives home the peanut butter cup comparison.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/22/dining/17Apperex/17Apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H20M", "recipeYield": "About 3 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets, dessert", "keywords": "maple syrup, oat creamer, peanut butter, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1078}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup pure maple syrup\u00a0", "2 cups unsweetened oat creamer", "1 cup smooth creamy peanut butter (preferably not natural peanut butter, which can be gritty; see Tip)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of salt", "Chocolate shavings or sprinkles, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, simmer maple syrup, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reduces by a third, 8 to 12 minutes.
