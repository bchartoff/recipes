It takes time to achieve the proper balance between elasticity and extensibility in the dough. If it is too elastic, it won\u2019t stretch to the desired thinness, but if it is too stretchy, it is too hydrated and won\u2019t maintain its shape. Keep at it: The more often you make it, the better it will be. If you find the dough springing back after you roll it out, it may need more time to rest, so let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before resuming, or refrigerate it for up to 24 hours. Because the dough is the result of just two ingredients \u2014 flour and eggs \u2014 use the freshest eggs you can find.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/16cookbooksrex6/merlin_160014927_49b81cd3-80dc-446c-a34b-53bdf6a95eea-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 1/2 pounds pasta (4 to 6 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas, project", "keywords": "eggs, flour, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 21}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound (455 grams) \u201c00\u201d flour, plus more for dusting", "260 grams eggs (about 5 large eggs)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sift the flour onto your work surface and make an 8-inch-wide well in the center.

If the dough feels too dry, spray it and your hands with water, a little at a time every few rounds, until it loses its dryness. (A spray bottle will best distribute the liquid evenly, but you could also dip your hands into a bowl of water.) If you are closing the round ball and find that it is not sealing, spray that with a touch of water to help it along.

If you've refrigerated your dough, make sure to let it first come back down to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before removing it from its plastic wrap and rolling it out."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a lightly floured work surface, flatten the dough ball with your palm to form a uniformly thick disk that is about 6 inches wide. Using a rolling pin positioned at the center of the dough, roll the rolling pin away from you with firm, even pressure, stretching the dough into a half oval. Lift the pin and bring it back to the center and roll the rolling pin toward you, creating a full oval. Rotate 90 degrees and repeat until the pasta dough is a rounded square that is at least 20 inches wide \u2014 the wider the better, as it\u2019ll result in a thinner, more delicate pasta. (Evan Funke recommends rolling out the dough until it is the thickness of 4 stacked pieces of paper, but do the best you can.) Cure the pasta dough by letting it sit out on your work surface until dry to the touch, 7 to 10 minutes. Flip the pasta dough and dry the other side, another 7 to 10 minutes. While flattened pasta dough is curing, roll out the other ball of dough. Once both doughs have been rolled out and cured, fold each pasta dough in half, press gently along the crease, and unfold. Using a sharp knife, cut the pasta in half along the crease."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position the half-moon-shaped pieces of dough with the round ends closest to you and the cut ends facing away from you.

Place the strands on a clean work surface or large sheet pan in a horizontal orientation, then gently tug them in the center to form into a U-shape. Repeat with the remaining dough strands.

Release your other hand and allow the strands to dangle over the top of your fingers. Loosely wrap the strands up and over your hand until they are completely wrapped.
