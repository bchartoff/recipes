{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cold Noodle Salad With Spicy Peanut Sauce", "description": "Soba, Japanese buckwheat noodles, are ideal for salads because they taste particularly great when served cold. Crunchy vegetables are highlighted here, adding lots of crisp, fresh texture. Substitute with any raw vegetables you have on hand, such as cabbage, carrot, fennel, asparagus, broccoli or cauliflower. The spicy peanut sauce is very adaptable: If you don\u2019t want to use peanut butter, you can use any nut or seed butter, like cashew, almond, sunflower or even tahini. Both the soba and the peanut sauce can be prepared ahead of time and stored in the fridge overnight, but wait to combine them until you are ready to eat for the best texture and consistency. The peanut sauce thickens as it sits, so add a tablespoon or two of water to loosen it up, if necessary.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/18/dining/hm-cold-noodle-salad/merlin_189371982_fe2a424a-73a9-4e56-b4e7-b77f4dfe544c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "peanut butter, salad, soba noodles, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5430}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "10 ounces soba noodles", "1 medium zucchini or cucumber (about 6 ounces)", "5 radishes (about 4 ounces)", "1 bell pepper (any color)", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1/2 cup roasted salted peanuts (about 2 ounces), roughly chopped", "2 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped", "Handful of cilantro leaves", "1 lime, cut into wedges for serving", "1/2 cup smooth peanut butter (not natural)", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "2 tablespoons maple syrup", "2 tablespoons lime juice (from 1 lime)", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "2 teaspoons chile oil or hot sauce, plus more to taste", "1 garlic clove, grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a pot of salted water to the boil.
