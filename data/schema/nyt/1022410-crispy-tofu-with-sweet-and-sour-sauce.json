{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Tofu With Sweet-and-Sour Sauce", "description": "Inspired by McDonald\u2019s Chicken McNuggets dipped in sweet-and-sour sauce \u2014 a classic combination that debuted nationwide in 1983 \u2014 this tofu appetizer gets its inexorable crunch from potato starch. Pan-fried until shatteringly crisp, pressed tofu, cut into cute little rectangles, eats a lot like Chicken McNuggets and cooks up gorgeously every time. But the true joy of a nugget lies in the dipping, and this recipe stars a totally chill, no-cook sweet-and-sour sauce. Apricot preserves provide fruity sweetness as well as body, and rice vinegar, soy sauce and onion powder add savoriness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/18/magazine/18mag-eat/18mag-eat-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, beans, finger foods, appetizer", "keywords": "apricot preserves, firm tofu, potato starch, zucchini, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1035}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) package firm tofu, drained", "3 medium zucchini (about 1 pound)", "3 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 cup apricot preserves", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder", "1/2 cup potato starch", "Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil, or light olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Press the tofu: Wrap the block of tofu in a clean tea towel, and place on a cutting board.
