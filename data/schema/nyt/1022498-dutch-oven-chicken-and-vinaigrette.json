{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dutch Oven Chicken and Vinaigrette", "description": "This is a simple dish: chicken that\u2019s a little bit braised and a little bit roasted in a covered Dutch oven. The seasonings \u2014 garlic, onions, herbs and lemon \u2014 are basic and border on assertive until they cook together, when their aromas intensify and their flavors soften. Putting half the aromatics in the pot with oil and wine, tucking the other half inside the chicken and cooking in this enclosed, steamy environment means that everything that goes into the pot goes into the chicken. When the chicken\u2019s cooked through, pour off the pan juices, crush the tender garlic and add sharp mustard and vinegar to make a vinaigrette that\u2019s as good over salad greens as over the chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/05/magazine/05mag-eat-web/05mag-eat-web-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "dijon mustard, dutch oven, roast chicken, sherry vinegar, whole chicken", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1512}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "1 medium onion (preferably yellow), trimmed, peeled and cut into eighths", "1 head garlic, cut crosswise", "5 fresh thyme sprigs\u00a0", "5 fresh rosemary sprigs\u00a0", "Fine or coarse sea salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 whole chicken (about 4 pounds)", "1/2 lemon", "3/4 cup white wine", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons wine vinegar (preferably sherry)", "1 teaspoon walnut oil (optional)", "3 to 4 handfuls salad greens"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chicken: Heat oven to 450 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour 3 tablespoons of the olive oil into a Dutch oven large enough to hold the chicken, then toss in all but 1 piece of the onion.
