{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Savory Oatmeal With Greens and Yogurt", "description": "Take a break from sweetened oatmeal for breakfast and try this savory version, simple enough to prepare even on a busy weekday morning (though for that matter, it\u2019s good any time of day). With garlicky spinach and yogurt, it is a well-rounded healthy meal. Make the toasted oat and nut topping in advance and you\u2019ll be a step ahead; the quantities below make more than you'll need, so make it once and keep it on hand for up to two weeks. Regular oats take only about 30 minutes to cook and have more flavor than quick-cooking oats. \u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/24/dining/24KITCH/24KITCH-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "almond, oats, pumpkin seeds, spinach, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 254}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup oats", "1/4 cup slivered raw almonds", "1/4 cup pumpkin seeds", "1/4 cup hemp seeds or sunflower seeds", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup oats", "Salt and pepper", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small clove garlic, finely diced", "Pinch of crushed red pepper", "5 ounces spinach leaves, about one large handful washed and drained", "Plain full-fat yogurt, preferably Bulgarian yogurt, for garnish \u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the toasted oat and nut topping: Mix the oats, almonds, pumpkin seeds and hemp seeds together in a small bowl with salt and olive oil.
