{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grapefruit and Navel Orange Gratin", "description": "This winter dessert is adapted from a recipe from the French chef Olympe Versini's cookbook, \"Olympe.\" The creamy custard that naps the fruit is made with orange and grapefruit juice instead of milk (with a small amount of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche thrown in). Since oranges vary in size, I\u2019m giving you a weight rather than a number. You may not use the whole amount but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a way to enjoy any leftover oranges. I used about eight small Valencia oranges in all for this but they were about a third as heavy \u2013 though juicer -- as big navel oranges.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/24/science/24recipehealth/24recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dessert, fall, winter, gluten-free, healthy, kosher, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 191, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "9 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 750 grams oranges (you may not need all of them)", "2 pink grapefruit", "Cinnamon", "1 vanilla bean", "3 egg yolks", "75 grams sugar (about 1/3 cup)", "75 grams cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (about 1/3 cup)", "1 tablespoon rum"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set aside 200 grams oranges and 1 grapefruit.
