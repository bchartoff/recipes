{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Turkey Skewers With Cumin-Lime Yogurt", "description": "This recipe is a twist on the kebabs, kofte and grilled meats that are staples of Middle Eastern cuisines. Sumac powder, which is made from dried, ground sumac berries, is sprinkled on the kebabs to add a tart, lemony brightness to them, but if you don\u2019t have sumac, you can leave it out. Eat the skewers with a knife and fork, or, better yet, make little pita sandwiches with all of the fixings \u2014 the crunch of the cucumbers, cooling yogurt and the refreshing bite of mint are essential to balancing the dish. If you have trouble finding Persian cucumbers, use English cucumbers instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/26/dining/yf-turkey-kebabs/merlin_174609744_01bf4de9-487c-4428-a2e1-e4cee9a6b119-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, meat, skewers and kebabs, main course", "keywords": "cucumber, lime, mint, pita, red onion, sumac, turkey, turmeric, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 883}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large pitas", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 cup full-fat (at least 5 percent) Greek, skyr or other thick yogurt", "1 lime, halved", "1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "Kosher salt", "1 pound ground turkey, preferably dark", "1 tablespoon ground turmeric", "1 medium red onion, peeled and halved (one half grated and strained, and the other sliced into 1-inch wedges)", "1/2 tablespoon sumac powder (optional)", "1 packed cup fresh mint sprigs", "2 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced into thin coins"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak 8 bamboo or wooden skewers in water for 10 to 30 minutes before you begin the recipe."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
