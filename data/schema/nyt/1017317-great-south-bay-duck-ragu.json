He served it thick and dark, a kind of tomato jam knit together with heavy shreds of meat, riding a polenta raft: poultry that looked like pork and tasted of fish, a combination to reel the mind. It was food of deep intensity and flavor, and it led to crazy, vivid dreams. Made with farmed duck amped up with anchovies, juniper, and vinegar it becomes a dish of domestic heritage, though with a feral streak, absolutely delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/24/magazine/24Eat_span/24Eat_span-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "anchovy, chicken stock, duck leg, juniper berries, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 159}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1120, "unsaturatedFatContent": "58 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "95 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "sodiumContent": "1363 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 duck legs, trimmed", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "3 ribs celery, trimmed and cut into small dice", "2 medium-size carrots, peeled and cut into small dice", "1 medium-size red onion, peeled and cut into small dice", "4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "8 fillets of salted anchovy, rinsed, dried and minced", "6 juniper berries", "1 \u00bd cups dry red wine", "\u00bd cup red-wine vinegar", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 cups low-sodium chicken stock", "1 tablespoon minced fresh sage", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "2 cups cooked polenta, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350.
