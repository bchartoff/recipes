{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Flour Poundcake", "description": "Rice flour makes this poundcake melt-in-your-mouth tender, and gives it a mild and delicate flavor that\u2019s spiced with a touch of black pepper. It keeps well, so feel free to bake it a day or two ahead of serving, or eat any leftovers for breakfast. This recipe was created by Zachary Golper of Bien Cuit bakery in Brooklyn, who prefers Japanese rice flour for its consistently fine particle size, but any white rice flour will work. (Note: If you don't have an 8-inch loaf pan, you can use a 9-inch pan but the baking time will be about 5 to 10 minutes shorter, and the loaf will be flatter in appearance.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/15/dining/10apperex/10apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 (8-inch) loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "butter, coconut milk, rice flour, sugar, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 719}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing", "4 tablespoons/60 milliliters coconut oil", "1 1/2 cups/200 grams white rice flour (not sweet rice flour)", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (optional)", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon/225 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters sour cream", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters unsweetened coconut milk", "1 teaspoon mezcal or tequila, or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
