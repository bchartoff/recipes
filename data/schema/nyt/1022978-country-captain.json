{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Country Captain", "description": "The American South has long laid claim to Country Captain, but the dish\u2019s origins can be traced back to the British Raj. It\u2019s an Anglo-Indian legacy of colonials with palates newly awakened to the possibilities of spice. In this version from Rohan Kamicheril, who grew up in Bangalore, only a few seasonings are called for: turmeric, ginger-garlic paste \u2014 easy to mash up quickly or buy premade \u2014 and Kashmiri chile powder, which has a gentle heat that can be approximated with a mix of paprika and cayenne. Vinegar is the last, vital touch, its sourness twangs the nerve and startles the other flavors into focus. The recipe is simple, but it takes skill to make, and should be eaten immediately.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/20/magazine/20mag-eat-site/20mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 308}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste (see Tip)", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon Kashmiri chile powder or 1/2 teaspoon cayenne plus 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces", "Neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola, for frying", "1 large onion, thinly sliced into half-moons", "1 large russet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice", "Salt", "Soft white bread, such as a Pullman loaf or Japanese milk bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the ginger-garlic paste with the turmeric, chile powder and vinegar in a large bowl, then toss the chicken in the marinade to coat.
