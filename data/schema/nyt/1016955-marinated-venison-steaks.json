The season for hunting big game comes to a close in the last, best place on the Thanksgiving weekend, and those who have not yet bagged a buck are known, said Dennis Konopatzke, the proprietor of Great Northern Brewing Company in Whitefish, to rush their holiday dinners in order to get out to the woods to hunt.\n\nYou\u2019ll find huckleberries on Thanksgiving tables in Montana, Mr. Konopatzke added, or the Norwegian cured fish known as lutefisk, or pork pies and stuffed pasties, all nods to the state\u2019s diverse history of settlers from afar. But game is the game. What follows is a recipe honed over the years by the members of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation for a marinade that works on wild venison perfectly and most other proteins as well. Broil some steaks and pair the result with traditional Thanksgiving side dishes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19MONTANA/19MONTANA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts", "keywords": "fall, winter, main course, venison", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 294}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 870, "unsaturatedFatContent": "58 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "79 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1920 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil", "3/4 cup soy sauce", "1/2 cup red wine vinegar", "1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed", "1 1/2 teaspoons roughly chopped fresh parsley", "2 tablespoons dry mustard", "2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed", "2 pounds venison loin or leg, cut into 6 steaks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all ingredients except venison in a large bowl.
