You need ripe tomatoes to weep juices, which then mingle with grassy olive oil and milky cheese to make your dressing. Basil adds freshness, black pepper and flakes of sea salt add crunch, and that\u2019s it, a perfect combination. But if the stone fruit options are looking better than the tomatoes at the market, you can use them instead. They\u2019re similar in flavor to tomatoes, but need cajoling to relinquish their juices. By letting sliced fruit macerate with salt, sugar and lemon juice, their fruitiness becomes more electric and their juices pool on the plate. Start with fruit you can smell and pair it with equally quality ingredients. Caprese is more about shopping than cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/AS-stone-fruit-caprese-15SALADREX/merlin_209652426_be14516a-2afa-4736-b639-e265effdb8bb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy, lunch, quick, snack, weeknight, salads and dressings, appetizer", "keywords": "cherries, mozzarella, nectarine, peach, plum, stone fruit, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 696}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds ripe but firm stone fruit (such as nectarines, peaches, plums, cherries or a mix)", "1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus more as needed", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar, plus more as needed", "Flaky sea salt", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, at room temperature\u00a0", "About 20 basil or mint leaves, or a combination, torn if large", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pit the stone fruit and cut into irregular pieces.
