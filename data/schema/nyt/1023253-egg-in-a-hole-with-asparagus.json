{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Egg-in-a-Hole With Asparagus", "description": "What would you get if you crossed savory Parmesan French toast with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017505-egg-in-a-hole\">egg-in-a-hole</a> and served it beneath a pile of roasted asparagus? An easy, vegetable-focused brunch or light dinner that you can make on a single sheet pan. The key here is to use wide slices of bread large enough to hold two eggs each: Choose slices from the middle of the loaf. (If your bread slices are smaller, just use one egg in each.) Feel free to substitute other quick-roasting vegetables for the asparagus. Broccoli florets, halved cherry tomatoes or brussels sprouts, or sliced mushrooms will all work equally well. And if you want to double the recipe, use two sheet pans, arranging the bread on one and the asparagus on the other.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/08/dining/03apperex/merlin_207907752_e2bd6a86-652c-4a2b-8eed-cef42d84b905-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, egg, parmesan, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 313}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "5 large eggs", "1/3 cup whole milk", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 wide slices sturdy country white bread, such as sourdough or peasant bread (preferably from the middle of the loaf)", "8 ounces asparagus, trimmed", "3 scallions, thinly sliced", "3 fresh thyme sprigs", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
