{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hoshigaki (Dried Persimmons)", "description": "Japanese hoshigaki are a special, seasonal treat made with firm, astringent Hachiya persimmons that are dried for a few weeks until they become extremely tender and sweet. The prep is a little intensive \u2014 each fruit must be peeled, dunked in boiling water and suspended in such a way that it doesn\u2019t touch anything, to discourage mold from forming. If the stems haven\u2019t been cut so they\u2019re easy to tie with string, they will require binder clips or another makeshift hanging solutions. But after the persimmons are set up, all they need is plenty of time, sunlight and air to transform into succulent hoshigaki. Slice the dried fruit and nibble it as is for dessert, pair it with good cheese, or toss it into a simple green salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/02/magazine/02mag-eat-site/02mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "24 persimmons", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "snack", "keywords": "fall, winter, persimmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "recipeIngredient": ["24 or more firm, unripe Hachiya persimmons, preferably with long stems to make hanging easy", "Kitchen string, or other thin string"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the fruit well.

If the stems aren\u2019t long enough for that, run short bamboo skewers through the tops of the persimmons and tie the skewers.

When the fruit is firm and dark and more powdery sugar covers the surface, it\u2019s ready to remove from the drying rack and store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month or in the freezer for up to 6 months.
