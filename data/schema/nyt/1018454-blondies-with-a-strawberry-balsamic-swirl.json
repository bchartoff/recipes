{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blondies With a Strawberry-Balsamic Swirl", "description": "Most blond brownie recipes rely on copious amounts of brown sugar for flavor, without calling for any chocolate. These, from \"Marbled, Swirled and Layered\" by Irvin Lin, are an excellent exception. Using white chocolate that has been roasted and caramelized, they have a rich, buttery character with a peppery undertone from a bit of extra-virgin olive oil whisked into the batter. A swirl of homemade balsamic strawberry compote gives them a vein of jammy fruit amid all the sweet, gooey cake. Stored in an airtight container at room temperature, they keep for up to 3 days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/07/dining/07JPCOOKBOOKS12/07JPCOOKBOOKS12-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "24 blondies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "balsamic vinegar, strawberries, white chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 153}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 268, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "82 milligrams", "sugarContent": "21 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 2/3 cups/285 grams white chocolate, in 1/4-inch chunks", "3/4 cup/170 grams (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature, more for pan", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 cup/165 grams packed dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 large eggs", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil", "2 1/4 cups/315 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/160 grams cubed strawberries (1/2-inch chunks)", "1 tablespoon/12 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Roast white chocolate: Heat oven to 300 degrees.
