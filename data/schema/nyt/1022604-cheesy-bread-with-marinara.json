{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Bread With Marinara", "description": "Soft, pillowy bread stuffed with melty mozzarella and dipped in a marinara sauce makes for an easy, crowd-pleasing appetizer or side dish. Here, store-bought sauce is doctored up with a few pantry staples, including dried oregano, garlic and red-pepper flakes, but you can use <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016478-simple-marinara-sauce\">homemade sauce</a>, too. Slice the bread or let everyone tear off pieces, like they would a fresh baguette, for a more spontaneous, cheese-pull moment. To round out the spread with something green, roast broccolini, broccoli or kale on a sheet pan in the oven as the bread cooks, then dip alongside. For a crunchier exterior, unwrap the bread and cook uncovered for the last 5 minutes.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/30/dining/yf-cheesy-bread/yf-cheesy-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "bread, marinara sauce, mozzarella", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 399}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 Italian loaf or rustic baguette", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 pound mozzarella, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 teaspoon dried oregano\u00a0", "2 large garlic cloves, grated or minced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 3/4 cups marinara sauce", "1/2 teaspoon sherry vinegar (optional)", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
