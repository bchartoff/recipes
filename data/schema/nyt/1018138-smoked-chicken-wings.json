{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoked Chicken Wings", "description": "If you have an offset smoker, even a leaky old fellow with rust spots and broken wheels, this recipe will provide one of its finest uses. Smoking chicken wings for 15 minutes or so before grilling or roasting them under thin bastings of barbecue sauce yields meat that is smoky but not aggressively so, deeply flavorful, with a marvelous crust. But you don\u2019t need a smoker! Simply set up your grill for indirect cooking, with a fairly small fire, and use soaked wood chips to create a plume of smoke. Put the wings on the cool side of the grill, then cover it and allow the smoke to perform its magic. You\u2019ll get wings that are pale gold, the color of chamois that you can cook into perfection over the direct heat of the fire.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/dining/25WINGS/25WINGS-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "barbecues", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, chicken wings, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 76}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 226, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "553 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["16 to 20 small to medium chicken wings, tips removed (save them for stock)", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper, to taste", "1 cup barbecue sauce (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013116-simple-barbecue-sauce\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a small fire in your grill, leaving one side free of coals.
