Tilt the pan to distribute the eggs and filling evenly over the surface. Shake the pan gently, lifting the edges of the omelet to let the eggs run underneath during the first minute or two of cooking. Turn the heat down to low, cover (use a pizza pan if you don\u2019t have a lid that will fit your skillet) and cook 10 minutes, shaking the pan gently every once in a while. Loosen the bottom of the omelet with a wooden spatula while tilting the pan from time to time, so that the bottom doesn\u2019t burn. The eggs should be just about set; cook a few minutes longer if they\u2019re not. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Finish the omelet under the broiler for one to two minutes, watching very carefully to make sure the top doesn\u2019t burn. Remove from the heat, and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Loosen the edges with a wooden or plastic spatula. Carefully slide from the pan onto a large, round platter, and cut into wedges or diamond-shaped pieces. If serving the next day, cover with plastic and then foil. Refrigerate overnight."}]}
