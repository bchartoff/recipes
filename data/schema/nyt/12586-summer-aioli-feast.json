{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Summer Aioli Feast", "description": "In Provence an aioli feast is not just a summer affair. But I love to throw an aioli party in the summer, when my guests and I can sit outside and enjoy the endless array of fish and vegetables with chilled ros\u00e9. Sometimes it\u2019s a potluck, and each guest brings a vegetable or fish to eat with the aioli. Traditionally the fish would be poached, but if you\u2019re outside with the grill going, go ahead and grill it (though that would require more olive oil, and the whole point of this garlic mayonnaise feast is to serve the mayonnaise with plainly cooked foods). The vegetables are traditionally boiled, but I prefer steaming most of them. Use this list of vegetables to guide you, but rely on the market when you make your choice. You don\u2019t have to serve everything on the list.
