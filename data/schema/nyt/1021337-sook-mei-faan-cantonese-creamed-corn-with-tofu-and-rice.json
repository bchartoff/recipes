There are many variations of sook mei faan, or corn rice. Some include chunks of pork or chicken, while another rendition has the creamy corn ladled over fried fish fillets. While this dish is traditionally made with canned creamed corn, this vegan version uses fresh corn, which offers a well-rounded sweetness that still feels bright, and is served over cold silken tofu, offering a pleasing contrast in texture and temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/13/dining/hm-corn-tofu/hm-corn-tofu-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, grains and rice, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "corn kernels, rice, tofu, vegetable broth, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 834}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (14-ounce) packages silken tofu, drained", "3 cups corn kernels (1 pound), from 3 large cobs or thawed from frozen", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed, vegetable or canola, plus more as needed", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "1 garlic clove, finely chopped", "2 scallions, finely sliced, plus more for serving", "1 1/2 cups vegetable stock", "Kosher salt", "White pepper", "2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water", "Steamed rice, for serving", "Cilantro leaves and tender stems, for garnish", "Sesame oil or chile oil, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Carefully pat the tofu dry with a clean kitchen towel, and cut each block into 8 slices."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place half the corn kernels into a blender or food processor, and blitz until creamy but still chunky."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a medium saucepan or deep skillet over medium-high.
