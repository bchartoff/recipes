{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso Chicken", "description": "Making a compound of unsalted butter and the salty, fungal deliciousness of Japanese miso paste is a surefire way of adding immense flavor to a simple weeknight meal. Here the mixture is spread over chicken thighs, which are then roasted to golden perfection. But you could easily use it on salmon or flounder, on corn or potatoes. The recipe calls for white miso, which is more mild than the aged version known as red miso. But you could certainly use red for a more intense result.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/25/dining/23PANTRY1/23PANTRY1-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chicken thigh, miso, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3905}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 864, "unsaturatedFatContent": "36 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "63 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "1525 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "1/2 cup white miso", "2 tablespoons honey", "1 tablespoon rice vinegar (do not use seasoned rice vinegar)", "Black pepper, to taste", "8 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs, approximately 2 1/2 to 3 pounds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
