{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nian Gao (Baked Sweet Potato Sticky Rice Cakes)", "description": "Nian gao is a homonym for the Chinese phrase \u201cnian nian gao sheng,\u201d which means increasing prosperity year after year. It is a dish indigenous to southern China in sweet and savory forms, and traveled with the diaspora to southeast Asia. This modern spin on classic nian gao comes from the food writer Christopher Tan, who wrote a book on Singaporean pastries titled \u201cThe Way of Kueh.\u201d He incorporates coconut milk, butter and mashed sweet potato into this nian gao for richness. The rice cake is usually steamed, but Mr. Tan bakes the batter in small molds for the contrast of a fudgy inside and crisp outside. The key to a smooth texture that stays soft after baking is resting the wet glutinous rice dough overnight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clarissa Wei"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/26/dining/21SINGAPOREREX6-nian-gao/merlin_200287482_7798a55b-7e32-4c4a-91ae-41fcde6ef806-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "24 to 42 nian gao, depending on pan size", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "coconut milk, lunar new year, plan-ahead, rice flour, singaporean, sweet potato, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 150}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/240 grams glutinous rice flour, preferably Erawan brand", "1 pound/450 grams orange or purple sweet potatoes", "1 1/4 cups/280 grams full-fat coconut milk", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/175 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "2 1/2 tablespoons/35 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/40 grams tapioca starch", "1 large egg", "Canola oil, for greasing pan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the glutinous rice flour and \u00be cup/180 grams water in a bowl to form a dough.
