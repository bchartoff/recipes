In Brazil, stroganoff is often made with beef, chicken or shrimp, but with a tomato base and heavy cream instead of sour cream. The biggest difference is in the accompaniments: The stew is served with rice and topped with crispy potato sticks. Do not omit the crunchy potato; it may be a garnish, but it is essential. If sticks are hard to find, replace them with lightly crushed chips.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ham El-Waylly"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/30/dining/hew-chicken-stroganoff/merlin_216459108_ea08be57-9e56-4fe3-9c7b-6b21b5115993-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "brazilian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, tomato pur\u00e9e, white mushroom", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1120}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 pound button mushrooms, wiped clean and cut into quarters", "Kosher salt\u00a0", "1 large yellow onion, finely diced\u00a0", "4 garlic cloves, minced\u00a0", "1 fresh or dried bay leaf\u00a0", "1 cup heavy cream\u00a0", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 cup tomato pur\u00e9e or passata", "1 tablespoon ketchup\u00a0", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\u00a0", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\u00a0", "1/3 cup parsley leaves, roughly chopped\u00a0", "Freshly cracked black pepper\u00a0", "Cooked white rice, for serving", "Crispy potato sticks, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a medium pot over medium-high heat and add the butter.
