A good sorbet should taste like an extraction of its main flavor, and nothing else. It should be gutsier than ice cream, and purer; there is no custard to compete with. But while sorbets are easy to make, they are also unforgiving, and require the best fruit you can find. For this recipe, you\u2019ll want to use the sweetest, ripest strawberries available, as the fruit\u2019s flavor is mostly the point here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "about 1 quart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, weekday, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dairy-free, low-fat, nut-free, dessert, moscato, orange juice, strawberry, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 162, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "6 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup very ripe strawberries, quartered", "1 cup moscato wine", "1/2 cup orange juice", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar", "2 tablespoons light corn syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, puree strawberries.
