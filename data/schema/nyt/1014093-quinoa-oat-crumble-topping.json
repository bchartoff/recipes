{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quinoa-Oat Crumble Topping", "description": "Lately I\u2019ve been thinking about desserts and all the after-dinner delights that my gluten-intolerant friends are missing. Pies, for instance: I have yet to come up with a gluten-free pie crust that I like. But crumbles can make a fine alternative, because the topping requires none of the flour that gluten-intolerant diners can\u2019t stomach. Crumbles are easy to throw together and are a perfect destination for seasonal fruit. In this recipe, I use flour made from quinoa \u2014 easy to do in a spice grinder \u2014 and gluten-free oats, which I ordered from Bob\u2019s Red Mill. Crumbles require little added sugar. So that I can make crumbles on a whim, I make the topping in advance and keep it in the freezer. Bake the crumble halfway through without the topping, then sprinkle it on and finish baking close to serving time. The topping never gets soggy waiting for the fruit underneath to cook. I like to stir leftovers into my yogurt for breakfast. This topping can be used to make any number of delicious, gluten-free crumbles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/05/science/04recipehealth600/04recipehealth600-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "dessert, fall, gluten-free rolled oats, quinoa, turbinado sugar, healthy, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 50}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 245, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "78 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups gluten-free rolled oats", "1/2 cup quinoa flour (grind quinoa in a spice mill to make the flour)", "1/3 cup unrefined turbinado sugar", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon salt (to taste)", "3 ounces (6 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
