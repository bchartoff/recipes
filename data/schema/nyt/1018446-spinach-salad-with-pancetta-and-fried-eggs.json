{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach Salad With Pancetta and Fried Eggs", "description": "Laced with nuggets of pancetta and crisp-edged fried eggs, there\u2019s a lot going on in this hearty salad, and you need a green that can stand up to it all. With its thick, ruffled leaves and almost mineral flavor, mature spinach (as opposed to those ubiquitous baby leaves) does the job well. If you can\u2019t find it, you can substitute baby spinach, though it will wilt when it makes contact with the hot eggs. Or try kale, which also holds up nicely. Serve this for a light dinner or a hearty brunch with some good bread and olive oil for dipping on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/23/multimedia/clark-spin-salad/clark-spin-salad-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, quick, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, eggs, pancetta, scallion, spinach, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 210}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 361, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "366 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small shallot, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 to 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated (or minced)", "1 1/2 tablespoons cider vinegar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/3 cup plus 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, more as needed", "3 ounces pancetta, diced", "2 scallions, thinly sliced, white and light green parts only", "4 eggs", "12 cups spinach, preferably mature spinach rather than baby, or use kale", "1/2 cup chopped fresh dill"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large salad bowl, whisk together shallots, garlic, vinegar, salt and pepper.
