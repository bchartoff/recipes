{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eshkeneh-yeh Adas (Lentil Egg Drop Soup)", "description": "Somewhere between a soup and a stew, eshkeneh appears in various preparations throughout Iran. One of the oldest dishes in the country\u2019s cuisine, eshkeneh is simple, flavorful, nourishing and hearty. The rustic dish requires minimal ingredients and satisfies on cold winter days. This version is made with lentils, potatoes and eggs, which are typically added at the end as a thickener, and is flavored with a hit of warm Aleppo pepper. The dried fenugreek leaves add depth, warmth and a distinct bittersweet fragrance. You can also use about 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped fenugreek leaves if you have some, but do not use seeds or powder. Be mindful that too much fenugreek turns a dish bitter.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/11/dining/nd-lentil-egg-drop-soup/merlin_199987200_f2e49bd2-bcf9-438e-bb87-2ca87c613bf1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "egg, lentils, yukon gold potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 927}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 large Yukon Gold potato (about 8 ounces), peeled and diced into \u00bd-inch cubes", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper, plus more to taste\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "3/4 cup green or brown lentils", "1/3 cup chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems, plus more as garnish", "2 teaspoons dried fenugreek leaves, crushed between your fingers (optional) (see Tip)", "3 large eggs\u00a0", "Flatbread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, heat the oil over medium, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, about 10 minutes.
