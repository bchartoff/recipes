{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Goddess Roasted Chicken", "description": "Green Goddess dressing \u2014 a creamy, piquant blend of herbs, garlic and anchovies \u2014 is good to eat on salad. And it\u2019s wonderful as a dipping sauce for vegetables. But its best use may be as a marinade for roast chicken. The mild chicken absorbs all the zippy flavors of the dressing, to emerge from the oven fragrant and golden, flecked with green. To intensify the herbal flavor, some of the green goddess mixture is set aside to use as a sauce. You could even pour a little on a salad or some vegetables on the side, and enjoy the best of all the Green Goddess variations in one savory bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/23/dining/video-clark-greengoddess/video-clark-greengoddess-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "basil, chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2020}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 815, "unsaturatedFatContent": "34 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "55 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "68 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1228 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups buttermilk or plain yogurt", "1 cup packed basil leaves", "1/4 cup packed chives", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "2 anchovy fillets (optional)", "1 scallion, white and green parts", "Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime", "2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 (4- to 5-pound) chicken, halved through the breast and back bones, patted dry with paper towels", "1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a blender, pur\u00e9e buttermilk, basil, chives, garlic, anchovies (if using), scallion, lime zest and juice, salt and pepper until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put chicken halves in a bowl or large heavy-duty resealable plastic bag and cover with three-quarters of the Green Goddess marinade.
