{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Scrunched Cabbage Salad With Fried Almonds", "description": "Crunchy and succulent, this hearty salad takes the humble cabbage and celebrates it as a leafy green. Raw cabbage can be tough and fibrous, which is why it is often thinly sliced for coleslaw. Massaging the leaves with salt \u2014 a technique common in kale salads \u2014 tenderizes the vegetable. The softened greens absorb the lemony dressing while nuts and seeds fry in olive oil. Store-bought roasted, salted almonds and toasted sesame seeds can be substituted, but adding freshly fried nuts and seeds to the salad while they\u2019re still warm showcases their rich, earthy aromas.
