{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "No-Bake Melon Cheesecake Bars", "description": "Reminiscent of honeydew-scented Korean ice cream bars, this no-bake cheesecake leans into a fruit flavor that hasn\u2019t had enough time in the sun: melon. Here, fresh cantaloupe pur\u00e9es into a smooth, fluffy pulp that sets into cheesecake, thanks to gelatin. Where the thick, salty-sweet base layer of buttery crackers will satisfy the crust lovers out there, the soft-set filling will change minds about what melon can truly do. Though the final drizzle of honey is optional, its floral taste works beautifully with the cantaloupe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2001/08/25/dining/ek-no-bake-cheesecake-bars/ek-no-bake-cheesecake-bars-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H20M", "recipeYield": "16 bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bar cookie, cantaloupe, cheesecake, cream cheese, graham cracker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 701}, "recipeIngredient": ["9 1/2 ounces/269 grams graham crackers (about 18 whole crackers)", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter, melted", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 (1/4-ounce/7-gram) packets powdered gelatin (about 5 teaspoons)", "1 1/4 pounds/566 grams peeled cantaloupe, diced (about 3 cups)", "1 (8-ounce/226-gram) package cream cheese, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy whipping cream", "Honey, for drizzling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: Place the graham crackers in a resealable plastic bag.
