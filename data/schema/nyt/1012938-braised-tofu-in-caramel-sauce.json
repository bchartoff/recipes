Here, tofu, firm and rich, takes on the character of savory Asian panna cotta, absorbing the velvety sauce and somehow heightening its flavor.\n\nVietnamese caramel sauce \u2014 nuoc mau \u2014 is easier to make than you might think, though it can be a dramatic process. In essence what you\u2019re doing is melting sugar in a pan, then allowing it nearly to burn and finally adding water and soy sauce in order to arrest the process at a dark and golden bittersweet flavor that is at the heart of Vietnamese cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/Braised-Tofu/Braised-Tofu-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 328}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 431, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "688 milligrams", "sugarContent": "56 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1-pound block firm tofu", "1 cup white sugar", "5 shallots, peeled and minced", "4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "2 tablespoons peeled and minced ginger", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "1/2 bunch scallions, white and light-green parts only, thinly sliced", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Cooked jasmine rice, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice the tofu in half along its length and then each portion into two thick slices.
