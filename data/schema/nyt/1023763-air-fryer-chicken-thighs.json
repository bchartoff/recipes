{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Air-Fryer Chicken Thighs", "description": "Simple and satisfying, chicken thighs brown beautifully in the air fryer, maintaining moisture thanks to their fat content. A quick, vinegar-spiked sour cream marinade adds oomph and helps tenderize the chicken. Despite being tossed and coated in a quick wet marinade (or overnight, if time permits), the skin still comes out deeply golden-brown and shatteringly crisp without leaving the meat lackluster. Because thighs vary in size, and air fryers range in size and power, make sure to take the internal temperature before removing your chicken from the air fryer, or pierce the chicken to check that the juices run clear rather than pink to ensure doneness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eleanore Park"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/22/multimedia/ep-air-fryer-chicken-thighs-1-bcb1/ep-air-fryer-chicken-thighs-1-bcb1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "air fryer, chicken thigh, dijon mustard, rice vinegar, sour cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 401}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 ounces each) or boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "Salt", "2 tablespoons sour cream", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat air fryer to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels.

When chicken thighs are fully cooked, an instant-read thermometer inserted into a thick part of the thigh should read 165 degrees and the juices should run clear when pierced.
