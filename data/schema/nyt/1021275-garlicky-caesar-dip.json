{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlicky Caesar Dip", "description": "This dip is inspired by classic Caesar dressing, with plenty of garlic and anchovy to wake things up. (You can even make it dairy-free, if you like, by using vegan cream cheese, substituting 1/3 cup nutritional yeast for the Parmesan, and adding an additional 1/4 teaspoon salt.) Serve it with a platter of raw or lightly blanched vegetables sprinkled with sea salt and dig in. Leftovers make a killer spread on a turkey sandwich, or a stellar accompaniment to grilled steak.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/23/dining/lh-caesar-dip/lh-caesar-dip-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, condiments, dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, cream cheese, dijon mustard, lemon juice, parmesan, worcestershire sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 265}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 lemons)", "6 anchovy fillets", "4 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "8 ounces cream cheese", "3/4 cup grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup mayonnaise", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Chopped fresh parsley, for serving (optional)", "Raw or lightly blanched vegetables and potato chips, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, combine the lemon juice, anchovies, garlic, mustard and Worcestershire sauce and process until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the cream cheese, Parmesan and mayonnaise and process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Taste for seasonings and add salt and pepper to taste.
