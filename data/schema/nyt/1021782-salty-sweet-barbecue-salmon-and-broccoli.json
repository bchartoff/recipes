{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salty-Sweet Barbecue Salmon and Broccoli", "description": "This salmon and broccoli sheet-pan dinner gets a boost from bottled oyster sauce, which is made from caramelized oyster juices, salt and sugar, and tastes like a sweet yet briny soy sauce. It makes the perfect base for a rich barbecue sauce that comes together in just 10 minutes. Caramelized sugar, tomato paste and soy sauce quickly create depth, while vinegar balances the sweetness. The salty-sweet sauce complements the buttery salmon and does double duty as a glaze and finishing sauce. It also serves as a terrific marinade for chicken and steak, so you may want to make a double batch of it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/11/dining/kc-sticky-salmon/kc-sticky-salmon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "broccoli, ginger, oyster sauce, salmon, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 603}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound broccoli florets, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 8 cups)", "12 scallions, trimmed and halved crosswise", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and julienned (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)", "1/4 cup safflower or canola oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons finely chopped yellow onion", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 teaspoon tomato paste", "3 tablespoons turbinado sugar (or 2 tablespoons light brown sugar)", "6 tablespoons oyster sauce", "2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets", "Steamed rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.\u00a0On a rimmed baking sheet, combine broccoli, scallions, ginger and 2 tablespoons oil.
