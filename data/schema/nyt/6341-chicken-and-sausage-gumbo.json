{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Sausage Gumbo", "description": "This recipe came to The Times in 1983 from Paul Prudhomme, the New Orleans chef who put Louisiana on the American culinary map. It is a hearty, rich Creole stew generously seasoned with black and white pepper, cayenne, paprika and fil\u00e9 powder, a spice made from the leaves of the sassafras tree. Fil\u00e9 powder is readily available in most grocery stores and online, and while it's not 100 percent necessary, it lends a distinctive, earthy quality to the dish. Mr. Prudhomme intended this to be made with chicken, but we've had excellent results using leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Paul Prudhomme"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/30/dining/30COOKING-CHICSAGE-GUMBO1/30COOKING-CHICSAGE-GUMBO1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 or more servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun, creole, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "celery, chicken, chicken broth, file powder, flour, green pepper, poultry, rice, smoked sausage, spices, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 672}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 chicken, 3 to 4 pounds, cut into serving pieces", "Salt to taste if desired", "1 teaspoon finely ground black pepper", "1 1/4 teaspoons finely ground white pepper", "1 teaspoon powdered mustard", "1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper", "1 1/2 teaspoons paprika", "1 teaspoon granulated garlic", "1 teaspoon file powder, optional", "1 1/2 cups flour", "2 1/2 cups corn, peanut or vegetable oil", "3/4 cup finely chopped onion", "3/4 cup finely chopped celery", "3/4 cup finely chopped green pepper", "9 cups chicken broth", "1 3/4 cups chopped or thinly sliced smoked sausage such as andouille or kielbasa", "1 bay leaf", "1 teaspoon finely minced fresh garlic", "2 cups cooked rice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put chicken pieces in a bowl.
