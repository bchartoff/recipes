{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Bread Crumbs and Anchovies, Sicilian Style", "description": "Here's a delightfully simple yet deeply flavorful Sicilian-style pasta sauce from Paula Wolfert, the prolific Mediterranean cookbook author. As you wait for your pasta to cook, saut\u00e9 a garlic clove in a good bit of olive oil, then discard the clove. Toss in two cans of anchovy fillets and mash them with the back of your spoon until they dissolve into a fragrant sauce. Drain the pasta, then combine it with the anchovy sauce and serve. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley for color and toasted bread crumbs for crunch. If you're serving this as a main course, double the recipe, for four generous servings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Paula Wolfert"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/07/dining/07COOKING-PASTA-BREADCRUMBS-ANCHOVIES1/07COOKING-PASTA-BREADCRUMBS-ANCHOVIES1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, pastas", "keywords": "anchovy, bread crumbs, pasta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 260}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 542, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1290 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup Sicilian olive oil or substitute a good fruity, green olive oil", "1 garlic clove, peeled and halved", "2 pinches of red-pepper flakes", "2 2-ounce cans flat fillets of anchovy, drained, rinsed, dried and cut small", "1/2 pound spaghettini, preferably imported, made of 100 percent durum wheat", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh Italian parsley", "1 1/4 cups coarse fresh bread crumbs, toasted (see notes)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place olive oil and garlic in a heavy skillet and gently cook the garlic over medium heat until golden.
