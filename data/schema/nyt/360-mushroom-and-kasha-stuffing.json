Add 1 1/2 cups of stock, bring to a simmer, cover and cook until the groats are just tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. (This proportion of liquid to grain is smaller than recommended on the package. The results are crunchy and separate, but additional moisture is picked up in the process of cooking the stuffing in the poultry and the grains will soften.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat butter and oil in a large skillet.
