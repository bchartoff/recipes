{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Ground Meat\u00a0Skewers", "description": "These oniony, deeply spiced skewers, made with just about any kind of ground meat, are based on Adana kebabs, which are named for the Turkish city from where they\u2019re said to have originated. Adana kebabs are traditionally made from hand-minced lamb that\u2019s been larded with lamb tail fat, but the flavors of cumin, red chile flakes and sumac are just as delicious with regular ground lamb, or even ground beef or turkey. The trick to getting a pleasing, springy texture is to knead the meat and seasonings until the mixture feels sticky. Keep everything cold, and then wet your hands when you form the meat around the skewers. Cooking the kebabs over charcoal adds a compelling smokiness, but using the highest heat on your gas grill will also work well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/28/dining/23apperex1/23apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "skewers and kebabs, main course", "keywords": "ground beef or lamb, onion, sumac, urfa pepper", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 266}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound cold ground meat, such as lamb, beef, turkey or a combination", "2/3 cup finely minced or grated white onion", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated, pressed or minced", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro or parsley, plus more for garnish", "1 1/4 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground sumac (see Tip), plus more for serving", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon Urfa or Aleppo pepper", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large mixing bowl, combine the meat, onion, garlic, cilantro, cumin, sumac, salt, Urfa pepper, black pepper, and cinnamon, if using."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "With your hands, thoroughly knead and massage the meat to incorporate the ingredients, about 4 minutes.
