{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Chicken With Lemon and Za\u2019atar", "description": "This plump and juicy roast chicken benefits from tenderizing in a yogurt-lemon-garlic marinade for as long as 24 hours, but if you don\u2019t have a lot of time, slathering it with the mixture before sliding it into the oven will still add flavor, and give the spices something to stick to. Za\u2019atar, a Middle Eastern herb-and-spice blend, can still be hard to find in the supermarket, so make your own by combining sumac, sesame seeds, thyme, coriander, oregano and cumin. You can buy sumac, a garnet-colored lemony spice, in Middle Eastern markets or online, but the rest of the ingredients are most likely already on your spice rack, and leaving out one or two of them is perfectly O.K. If you have a premade za\u2019atar blend on hand, you\u2019ll need about 1/2 cup to coat the chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/dining/ss-zaatar-chicken/ss-zaatar-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, roasts", "keywords": "chicken, coriander, greek yogurt, lemon, sesame seeds, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 236}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup plain full- or reduced-fat Greek yogurt", "3 lemons (1 lemon zested and juiced; 2 lemons, halved)", "2 large garlic cloves, finely grated", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 (4- to 5-pound) whole chicken", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons toasted white<strong> </strong>sesame seeds (see Tip)", "2 tablespoons sumac (optional)", "1 tablespoon dried thyme", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "2 teaspoons dried oregano", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "3 medium shallots, peeled and halved lengthwise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a shallow bowl, stir together yogurt, zest and juice of 1 lemon, garlic and 2 tablespoons olive oil.
