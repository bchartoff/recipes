{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kalpudding (Meatloaf With Caramelized Cabbage)", "description": "This is a Swedish version of a dish with roots in the Ottoman Empire, an infidel\u2019s version of Turkish dolmas, made not with lamb and grape leaves but with ground pork and beef cloaked with deeply caramelized cabbage. It is served here with lingonberry preserves cut with vinegar and Worcestershire sauce, and made velvet with butter. The dish goes beautifully with boiled potatoes. In Sweden, you\u2019d use golden syrup to caramelize the cabbage, but molasses works just as well. The Swedish chef Magnus Nilsson told me the result is no less Nordic for the substitution. \u201cCabbage smells in a very special way when it almost burns,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets savory, almost like a beef stock. It tastes almost brown and umami yummy.\u201d You\u2019ll want to eat it right away, but the leftovers make for a fine sandwich in coming days.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/05/magazine/05eat/05eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "roasts", "keywords": "cabbage, ground beef, ground pork, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1452}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 947, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "67 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "sodiumContent": "1331 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unsalted butter", "1 head green cabbage, approximately 3 pounds, cored and shredded", "3 tablespoons molasses", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste", "3/4 pound ground beef", "3/4 pound ground pork", "1 small yellow onion, peeled and chopped", "1 cup heavy cream", "4 tablespoons breadcrumbs", "1/3 cup chicken, beef or vegetable stock, ideally homemade or low-sodium store-bought (or water)", "1/3 cup lingonberry preserves", "1 tablespoon red-wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350.
