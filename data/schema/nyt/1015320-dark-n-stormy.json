It is simply dark rum \u2014 very dark rum \u2014 with ginger beer and some fresh lime. The rich spirit is shaken awake by the buoyant piquancy of the ginger beer, while the lime slashes through the sweetness of both. The drink has its roots in Bermuda, and emigrated up the Atlantic seaboard with the sailing set. Gosling\u2019s rum has a rather sniffy and debatable lock on the recipe, having in fact trademarked its version, even going to the point of threatening with the specter of litigation anyone who might suggest concocting one with another rum. Gosling\u2019s is a delicious rum, and being the dark rum from Bermuda, it is unquestionably synonymous with the dark \u2018n\u2019 stormy. But, any number of dark rums are interchangeably lovely in this drink, including Coruba, Zaya, Cruzan\u2019s Blackstrap and the Lemon Hart 151 from Guyana.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Toby Cecchini"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/23/dining/Dark-n-Stormy/Dark-n-Stormy-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, easy, cocktails", "keywords": "ginger beer, lime juice, rum", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 57}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 110, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "9 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces dark rum", "1/2 ounce fresh-squeezed lime juice", "1/2 ounce simple syrup, or to taste", "4-6 ounces fresh ginger beer."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build the drink in a highball glass filled with ice, adjusting for sweetness and tartness.
