{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Cleaning Ribollita\u00a0", "description": "This weeknight ribollita highlights the bounty of spring and is a great way to use up all of those leftover vegetables and day-old bread. The soup is highly customizable, so use whatever you have on hand in the fridge and pantry: Kale or spinach can sub in for the Swiss chard; sweet corn can step in for peas; and white beans can take the place of butter beans. In this Italian classic, bread dissolves into the soup, thickening it for a heartier texture. Leftover soup can be turned into a pasta meal with the addition of orzo or any short pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/09/dining/kc-spring-cleaning-ribollita/merlin_206514753_357deecb-8122-47d7-8b4d-a137ea55491e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "butter beans, ciabatta bread, swiss chard, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 420}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium leek, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced crosswise\u00a0", "1 large carrot, peeled and diced", "1 pound Swiss chard, stems thinly sliced and leaves coarsely chopped (stems and leaves kept separated)", "Salt and black pepper", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 (14-ounce) can whole tomatoes", "1 large zucchini, ends trimmed, quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise", "2 basil sprigs, plus \u00bc cup chopped basil", "2 thyme sprigs", "1/2 cup peas (fresh or frozen)", "1 (14-ounce) can butter beans, rinsed", "4 ounces day-old ciabatta or country bread, crust removed and bread cut into 1-inch cubes (see Tip)", "Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium.
