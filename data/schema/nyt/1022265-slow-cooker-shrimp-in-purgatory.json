{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Shrimp in Purgatory", "description": "This recipe is inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019109-eggs-in-purgatory\">eggs in purgatory</a>, a Southern Italian dish in which eggs simmer in a spicy tomato sauce. Shrimp aren\u2019t commonly thought of as slow cooker material, but here, the sauce simmers for several hours, and the quick-cooking shrimp is dropped in just a bit before you want to eat. (You can use frozen shrimp; just thaw them first.) Cooking the sauce on high allows the onion and garlic to tenderize and melt into the sauce. The tomatoes and roasted peppers caramelize slightly as they simmer, so when fully cooked, the sauce should be a shade darker than when you started. The sauce holds well on the warm setting. Serve the shrimp in shallow bowls on its own, or over orzo, couscous or polenta and with crusty bread.
