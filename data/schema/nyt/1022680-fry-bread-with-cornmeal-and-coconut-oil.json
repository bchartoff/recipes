{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fry Bread With Cornmeal and Coconut Oil", "description": "Ingenuity is behind Indigenous fry bread. When the United States government forcibly relocated Navajos (Din\u00e9) from ancestral lands in the 19th century, Native American women invented fry bread from government-issued commodities: flour, salt, yeast and water. Today, Native Americans have reclaimed this survival food as a tasty symbol of resilience. Cooks improvise on the basic formula using ingredients based on preference and geography: Styles, sizes and shapes differ by region, tribe and family. Fry bread is comfort food, and variations are shaped by memory and connection, leading to playful jests about the \u201cright\u201d kind. This particular recipe has Afro-Indigenous origins with its use of sugar and cornmeal, which add sweetness and density. But raw sugar replaces white sugar, and coconut oil steps in for lard. When used for frying, the oil\u2019s aroma announces the arrival of something special.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kevin Noble Maillard"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/03/dining/01frybread/merlin_196269519_b5ed0d07-0f4d-4131-9abc-141cb159c6b5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H30M", "recipeYield": "About 38", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads, side dish", "keywords": "cornmeal, flour, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 71}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup finely ground cornmeal", "2 (1/4-ounce) envelopes instant dry yeast", "1 cup raw sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "Unrefined coconut oil, for frying (about 32 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, bring 2 cups water to a boil over medium-high.
