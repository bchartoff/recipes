{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cauliflower Rice", "description": "Cauliflower is a kitchen chameleon that\u2019s available at most every grocery store year-round. Once pulverized into granules, it becomes a weeknight savior, keeping in the refrigerator for nearly a week and stepping in easily for normal rice. For the most flavorful cauliflower rice, use a little fat; add alliums like onion, garlic and scallions; and roast it instead of steaming or saut\u00e9ing it, so the raw edges caramelize. Pop the little florets into the oven while you make the rest of dinner, then serve it as you would rice: with curry, a stir-fry, a protein and a vegetable, or just an egg on top. Cauliflower rice is also very amenable to having flavors added before or after roasting (see some ideas in the recipe below), or simply being eaten raw, dressed like a salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/27/dining/as-cauliflower-rice/merlin_148112625_06531f26-fdb9-44ba-a793-b7066fac8acf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 cups raw; 4 to 5 cups cooked", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "cauliflower, garlic, olive oil, gluten-free, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 271}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 226, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "486 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium cauliflowers (about 4 pounds total), cored and cut into florets", "6 tablespoons olive oil", "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon),\u00a0optional", "Kosher salt and\u00a0black pepper", "1 1/2 tablespoons canola or other neutral oil", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons tahini", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan", "Black pepper", "1/2 cup red onion or shallots, finely chopped", "1/4 cup scallions, thinly sliced", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup mint leaves, roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons fish sauce", "2 tablespoons lime juice", "2 teaspoons red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees if you\u2019re serving the rice cooked."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a food processor halfway with cauliflower florets, then pulse\u00a0\u00a0until it breaks down to about 1/4- and 1/8-inch pieces and resembles rice.\u00a0Transfer to a very large bowl.
