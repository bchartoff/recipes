{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Butter Rugelach", "description": "Apple butter, like applesauce, is made from apples that have been cooked down, but the process is taken even further. The result is a thick, caramelized paste that you can spread with a knife instead of eating it with a spoon. Here, it is paired with honey, walnuts and currants to make a fall-inspired rugelach cookie. The cream cheese in the dough gives it a pleasant tang and makes it super easy to work with.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/dining/seneviratne-apple-butter-rugelach/seneviratne-apple-butter-rugelach-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "32 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american, jewish", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, pastries", "keywords": "apple butter, walnut, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 229}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 100, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "53 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "4 ounces/115 grams cream cheese, at room temperature (3/4 cup)", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1/2 cup/130 grams unsweetened apple butter", "2 tablespoons honey", "2 tablespoons sugar", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 cup/60 grams finely chopped walnuts", "1/4 cup/70 grams currants or chopped raisins", "1 large egg, beaten", "Demerara or sanding sugar, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a stand mixer or in a large bowl, using a handheld mixer, on medium, beat the butter, cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and salt until fluffy, about 2 minutes.
