{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Salt-Baked Shrimp", "description": "The chef Adam Evans of The Optimist in Atlanta likes to roast big, fresh Southern shrimp with the heads in a deep dish of rock salt studded with spices, an easy method that produces tender, delicately flavored and perfectly seasoned shrimp. Here, headless shrimp take on fragrance from cinnamon and star anise and get heat from jalape\u00f1os. The presentation is spectacular for a dinner party. Let the salt cool completely before you toss it out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/05/dining/saltshrimp-still/saltshrimp-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick", "keywords": "cardamom, jalape\u00f1o, peppercorns, rock salt, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 85}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1289 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds rock salt", "1/4 cup whole green cardamom pods", "2 tablespoons black peppercorns", "1 cinnamon stick", "4 bay leaves", "3 star anise", "1 lemon, cut into four wedges", "10 sprigs of thyme", "2 jalape\u00f1o peppers, cut into thick slices", "1 head of garlic, outer skin removed and smashed into several pieces", "2 pounds medium or large shrimp, about 20 to 25 pieces, with shells and tails on", "Cocktail sauce, tartar sauce or melted butter, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 475 degrees.
