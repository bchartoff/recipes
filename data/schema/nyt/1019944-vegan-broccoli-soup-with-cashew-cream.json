{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Broccoli Soup With Cashew Cream", "description": "This nourishing, three-vegetable soup is thick and creamy, even without dairy. It takes very little skill and only 25 minutes to make, but success lies in proper blending: Use a high-powered blender for the creamiest soup, or let it go a few minutes longer in a standard blender. Fennel and celery provide welcome depth, and the quick cashew cream feels luxurious spooned over the top or stirred right in. Save any extra to drizzle on other blended soups or even roasted vegetables. Finish this vibrant bowl with celery leaves, parsley or dill, and two basic but crucial ingredients: an extra drizzle of olive oil and a dusting of freshly ground pepper.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/dining/sc-broccoli-soup-with-cashew-cream/sc-broccoli-soup-with-cashew-cream-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, lunch, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, broccoli, cashew, celery, fennel", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 378}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups raw cashew pieces (or whole raw cashews)", "Fine sea salt", "1 cup boiling water", "1 large head broccoli (about 1 1/2 pounds), florets chopped into bite-size pieces and stems peeled and roughly chopped", "1 small fennel bulb, trimmed, quartered, cored and roughly chopped", "2 large stalks celery, trimmed and roughly chopped, leaves reserved for garnish", "2 tablespoons\u00a0extra-virgin\u00a0olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "Torn fresh dill or parsley leaves", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the cashews in a blender along with a pinch sea salt.
