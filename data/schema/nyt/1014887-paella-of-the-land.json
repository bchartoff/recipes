But its depths of flavors are increased exponentially by grilling the meats before adding them to the paella pan. Cooked over an open fire, the dish may be scary to contemplate, but it is not at all difficult to pull off.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/17/dining/17GRILLING_SPAN/17GRILLING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "about 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, chorizo, rabbit, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 160}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1004, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "65 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1496 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "1 medium-size rabbit, quartered", "Salt and pepper to taste", "4 links fresh chorizo or good-quality dried chorizo, like Palacios", "8 cups chicken broth", "3/4 bottle (about 2 3/4 cups) dry white wine", "2 teaspoons saffron threads, preferably Iranian", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "4 cloves garlic, chopped", "1/4 pound jam\u00f3n serrano, roughly chopped", "1 1-kilogram bag short-grained Spanish rice, preferably bomba or Calasparra", "4 medium-size ripe tomatoes, grated, skin discarded", "1 cup green peas (optional)", "Piquillo pimento, sliced into strips for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a medium-hot fire in your grill (when ready, you can hold your hand about 6 inches above the grill for only 2 or 3 seconds)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the chicken thighs and rabbit liberally with salt and pepper.
