{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Pasta With Ricotta and Herbs", "description": "In this simple, springy pasta, milky ricotta thinned out with a little starchy pasta cooking water makes for a saucy, soupy dish that\u2019s seasoned with loads of black pepper and herbs. For the best flavor, use at least three different kinds of herbs, break out some nicer olive oil and look for fresh ricotta. Lemon lovers can grate in the zest of half a lemon as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/27/dining/27appetite-1/27appetite-1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "basil, chives, parsley, pasta, ricotta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 934}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "1 pound short pasta, such as shells, cavatappi, chiocciole, farfalle, ditali or wagon wheels", "12 ounces fresh, whole-milk ricotta (about 1 1/2 cups)", "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper, plus more for serving", "2 1/2 cups coarsely chopped soft herbs, such as basil, chives, fennel fronds, parsley, mint, tarragon, chervil or dill (try for a combination of at least 3 kinds)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat.
