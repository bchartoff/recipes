{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Fish Sandwich", "description": "This fried fish sandwich doesn\u2019t stray far from the classic fast-food staple: breaded fish, a soft bun, a slice of cheese and tangy tartar sauce. The best part is you can put it together in just about the amount of time it would take to stand in line and order it at the counter. Capers, shallots and fresh dill make this tartar sauce feel a little fancy, but a splash of soy sauce adds the umami that takes it to a very familiar place. Flounder is an affordable choice for the recipe, but if you can\u2019t find it, substitute with sole or any mild flat fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/15/dining/sl-fried-fish-sandwich/merlin_186367122_3dd99025-7f64-4d30-8e23-fc710757a936-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sandwiches, seafood, main course", "keywords": "flounder fillets, mayonnaise, panko, pickles", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1071}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup mayonnaise", "1/4 cup bread and butter pickle chips, finely chopped, plus 1 tablespoon pickle brine", "1 small shallot, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh dill", "2 tablespoons (drained) capers, coarsely chopped", "1 teaspoon soy sauce or tamari", "Kosher salt", "1 cup vegetable oil", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "2 cups panko bread crumbs", "4 flounder fillets (about 1 pound), halved crosswise", "Kosher salt", "4 soft white buns", "4 slices American cheese or Cheddar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the tartar sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, pickles and pickle brine, shallot, dill, capers and soy sauce.
