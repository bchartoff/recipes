For them, there is this press-in crust made with just graham cracker crumbs, sugar, salt and butter. It works best with fillings that don't require the structure and heft of traditional pie dough, like this <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10862-key-lime-pie\">Key lime pie</a> or this <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020615-ube-pie\">ube pie</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/21/dining/graham-cracker-crust/graham-cracker-crust-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch crust", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastries, dessert", "keywords": "christmas, thanksgiving, graham cracker, sugar, salt, butter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 280}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ounces/140 grams graham crackers (one 9-cracker sleeve), pulsed into fine crumbs in a food processor (about 1 cup)", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt.
