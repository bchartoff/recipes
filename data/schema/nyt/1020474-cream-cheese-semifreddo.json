{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cream Cheese Semifreddo", "description": "This simple, refreshing and not-too-sweet frozen dessert is the perfect blank canvas to show off that fancy Italian balsamic vinegar in your cabinet. Natasha Pickowicz, the pastry chef at Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso and Flora Bar in New York, developed this easy yet sophisticated recipe for the 2019 NYT Food Festival. Ms. Pickowicz also likes this semifreddo with a spoonful of jam, or a drizzle of maple syrup, chocolate syrup or honey. (The photo shows a tart-sweet combination of balsamic vinegar and maple syrup.) Everything seems to shine against the backdrop of this parfait. If you\u2019d like, you can substitute mascarpone for the cream cheese, although the final result might be a bit softer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/ml-cream-cheese-semifreddo/merlin_161002737_d7f51c81-7b72-467d-867c-803e950475df-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings (One 8-inch loaf pan)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "cream cheese, egg yolks, heavy cream, rum, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 5}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 milliliters heavy whipping cream, chilled", "5 egg yolks, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon rum (optional)", "7 ounces/200 grams cream cheese, softened", "Maple syrup and cherry surette or best-quality balsamic vinegar, for serving", "Flaky sea salt, to garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line an 8-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside.
