{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rich and Buttery Corn Muffins", "description": "Made with plenty of melted butter and sour cream, these golden, lightly sweet corn muffins are moist, rich and delicately crumbly. If you can find coarsely ground cornmeal (as opposed the fine stuff that\u2019s on most supermarket shelves), you\u2019ll also get deep corn flavor and a pleasantly grainy texture. Serve these warm from the oven, slathered with even more butter, or halved and toasted under the broiler to crisp the surface. They\u2019ll even keep for a few days if you store them in the fridge, and freeze perfectly for up to a month.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/dining/27apperex/merlin_161002680_84c3136f-b524-44b7-b2af-f8124cfb0d9f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, breads", "keywords": "cornmeal, milk, sour cream, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 347}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/255 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), melted and cooled, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 cups/240 grams coarse or stone-ground cornmeal", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/165 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup/240 milliliters sour cream or whole-milk Greek yogurt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "Demerara sugar, as needed", "Softened butter, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees, and generously butter the cups and tops of a muffin tin.
