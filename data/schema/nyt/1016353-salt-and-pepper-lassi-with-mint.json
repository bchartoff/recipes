{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salt and Pepper Lassi with Mint", "description": "This savory lassi variation includes salt and mint leaves, which are traditional, and black pepper and lime zest, which are not. It\u2019s the kind of thing to serve with juicy ripe melon and prosciutto for a light hot weather lunch, or to offer as a nonalcoholic alternative at a cocktail party. Sheeps\u2019 milk yogurt lends a lovely earthiness to the mix but plain cows\u2019 milk yogurt is a perfectly fine alternative. Feel free to adjust the salt and sugar levels to suit your taste. You want this on the savory side, but a little more sweetness works nicely with the pepper and mint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/21/dining/21APPE2/21APPE2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "shakes and smoothies", "keywords": "mint, yogurt, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 35}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 118, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "317 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces (1 1/2 cups) sheep\u2019s milk yogurt", "1/4 cup coarsely chopped mint leaves", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "Zest of 1 small lime", "Pinch of brown sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all ingredients in a blender.
