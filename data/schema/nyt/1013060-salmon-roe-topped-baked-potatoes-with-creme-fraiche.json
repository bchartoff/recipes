The pairing is, as Ms. Clark wrote, \u201ca briny, creamy analogue\u201d to a porky version. Try it as a bright and festive appetizer during the holidays, or skip the salmon roe for a still-satisfying meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/01/dining/salmon-baked-potato/salmon-baked-potato-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 large servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, gluten-free, russet potatoes, salmon roe", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "777 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large russet potatoes (10 to 12 ounces each), scrubbed well", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, more for serving", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "4 teaspoons chopped chives", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 ounces salmon roe, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
