{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hot and Numbing Stir-Fried New Potatoes", "description": "These stir-fried potatoes are inspired by a modern street snack served in Xi\u2019an, China. They can be parboiled in advance, require only a few minutes of stir-frying in a wok before serving, and can be flavored with a wide range of spices and aromatics, making them an ideal side dish for any menu, simple or complex. In addition to the Xi\u2019an-style original with hot and numbing spices, you can also make a curry-spiced version with crunchy, fried cumin and mustard seeds, or a rosemary and garlic version that would be at home on a traditional Thanksgiving table (see Tips).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
