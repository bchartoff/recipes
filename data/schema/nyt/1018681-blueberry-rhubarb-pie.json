Also, watch for bubbling: This will tell you that the temperature is high enough that the thickeners have dissolved into the filling. \n\nAll-berry pies can be too sweet and soft, so the tart crunch of rhubarb makes an ideal complement, especially in early spring. This glowing purple-magenta filling is quite spectacular.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/29/dining/29SENSES5/29SENSES5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "blackberries, blueberries, rhubarb, dessert, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 235}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 385, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "835 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Dough for a double-crust pie, chilled <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-all-butter-pie-crust\">(see recipe; be sure to double it)</a>", "2 1/2 cups/312 grams rhubarb, trimmed and cut into 1/2- to 1-inch lengths", "1 1/2 cups/226 grams blueberries or blackberries", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar, more for sprinkling", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca (also called instant, minute or small pearl tapioca)", "1/3 teaspoon salt", "Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 tablespoon cold unsalted butter", "1 egg white, whisked with 1 tablespoon water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
