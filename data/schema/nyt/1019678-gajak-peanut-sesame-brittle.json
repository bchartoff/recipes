{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gajak (Peanut-Sesame Brittle)", "description": "This recipe for gajak \u2014 an Indian treat that\u2019s like a cross between peanut brittle and sesame candy, but with more nuanced flavor \u2014 comes from the North Carolina chef Cheetie Kumar, who always had it at Diwali and loves the way the flavors magically coalesce after the mixture sets for 45 minutes. Peanuts and sesame are found together in sweet recipes all through Northern India, and even appear as co-stars in savory dishes in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra in chutneys and stuffed in eggplant. Jaggery adds some savory undertones that you can't get from regular sugar. You can find it online, at Indian grocery stores or some larger Asian supermarkets (look for blocks or balls, rather than granulated jaggery). It\u2019s crucial to have your ingredients ready before starting; the gajak comes together fairly quickly but the sugar can burn if you don't watch it carefully. Cutting the brittle when it\u2019s warm will yield pretty, uniform pieces, but it can also be broken once it has hardened into uneven, rustic chunks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brigid Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/dining/31diwalirex1/31diwalirex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 24 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "snack, candies", "keywords": "dessert, jaggery, peanut, sesame seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon ghee, plus more for greasing the pan and rolling pin", "9 ounces/255 grams jaggery, grated on the largest holes of a box grater (see note)", "1 1/3 cups/200 grams toasted, skinless unsalted peanuts, chopped coarsely", "1/2 cup/75 grams toasted white sesame seeds", "1/3 cup/50 grams untoasted white sesame seeds, ground into a powder using a spice grinder, small food processor or mortar and pestle", "Pinch of kosher salt", "Pinch of green cardamom powder (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grease the back of a sheet pan and a rolling pin with ghee and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a wide, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes.
