{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Bean and Avocado Salad With Garlic Oil", "description": "Buttery avocado and creamy cannellini beans are a natural combination in this easy salad, and a quick garlic oil provides punch. The ingredient list is fairly simple, but here are a couple of tips that take it from good to great: First, make sure to remove the sliced garlic from the oil just as it starts to turn golden, so it doesn\u2019t burn. Second, when working with ripe avocados, bypass the standard way of scooping the flesh out of the skin. Instead, achieve immaculate edges by quartering the avocado lengthwise, then gently peeling back the skin to remove the flesh.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Corinne Trang"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/02/dining/ct-avocado-and-bean-salad/ct-avocado-and-bean-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, quick, beans, salads and dressings", "keywords": "avocado, cannellini beans, cilantro, garlic, lemon, fall, spring, summer, winter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 535}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 534, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "18 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "807 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup grapeseed oil", "3 large garlic cloves, very thinly sliced", "2 ripe Hass avocados", "2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed", "3 tablespoons cilantro or parsley leaves, roughly chopped", "1 lemon, zested and juiced (about 1/4 cup)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Pinch of smoked paprika (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high until it shimmers.
