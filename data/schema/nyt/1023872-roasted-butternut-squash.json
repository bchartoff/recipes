{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Butternut Squash", "description": "This is the simplest roasted butternut squash recipe, and it shows off the vegetable\u2019s greatest qualities: custardy, sweet and nutty, with caramelized and crisp outsides. Cube the squash into 1-inch pieces, then drizzle generously with oil and salt. (If you\u2019d like to use pre-cut pieces from the store, trim until they\u2019re uniform in size for even cooking.) So that the squash browns efficiently, roast it on the bottom rack of a hot oven mostly on one side, then stir and cook for a few more minutes until tender. Squash this good can stand alone as a side dish, or costar in salads, soups, pastas or other meals. The roasted squash will keep, refrigerated, for up to 5 days. If you want to add ground spices, like spicy hot paprika or warming cinnamon, do so after the initial roasting when stirring.
