{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oven-Fried Patatas Bravas (Crispy Potatoes With Two Sauces)", "description": "Served with spicy salsa brava and garlicky allioli, crispy hot patatas bravas are traditionally served in tapas bars throughout Spain. The salsa brava is made with piment\u00f3n, the smoked Spanish paprika sold as picante (hot) and dulce (sweet). Some cooks include a lot of chopped tomato, but my friends in Madrid tell me they prefer this version, which looks a bit like rusty gravy. As for the allioli, you can mount it by hand with a whisk, or use a stick blender as most Spaniards do. Though patatas bravas are typically pan-fried on the stovetop, I came up with this easier, oven-fried method. The potatoes emerge beautifully browned and crisped, and their flavor is sensational cooked in extra-virgin olive oil. This is not fancy fare. Grab a fork and dip the hot potatoes in both sauces for the optimal experience.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/dining/08Tanisrex-bravas/08Tanisrex-bravas-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "snack, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "egg yolks, garlic, pimenton, potato, small plate, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1147}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds yellow-fleshed or russet potatoes, peeled and cut in 1 1/2-inch chunks", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 head garlic, separated into cloves but not peeled", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 tablespoon piment\u00f3n dulce, or use sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon piment\u00f3n picante, 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder or 1/4 teaspoon cayenne", "1 cup chicken broth or water", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "Kosher salt", "2 egg yolks", "4 garlic cloves, pounded, finely minced or grated", "1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
