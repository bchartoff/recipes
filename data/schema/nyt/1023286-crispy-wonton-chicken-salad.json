{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Wonton Chicken Salad", "description": "This dynamic chicken salad, starring crispy strips of fried wonton wrappers, draws inspiration from the wonton chicken salad at the soup and salad buffet chain Sweet Tomatoes, as well as the American Chinese chicken salads that pervaded chain-restaurant menus throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. In a supporting role, letting the crispy wontons shine, is the punchy dressing of peach preserves, rice vinegar, sesame oil and chili powder. The dressing\u2019s low oil content \u2013 plus the addition of mayonnaise, which helps create an emulsion \u2013 means the salad greens stay crunchy and keep for longer. For the chicken, you can use any leftover meat or tear pieces from a store-bought rotisserie bird.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/26/dining/26EAT-crispy-wonton-chicken-salad1/merlin_208546647_524aafb6-2c28-49f2-8931-732bf091e458-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, main course", "keywords": "chicken, romaine, wonton wrappers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 686}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons rice vinegar", "3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "2 tablespoons peach or apricot preserves", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 teaspoon chili powder", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "Salt", "8 ounces cooked chicken meat, torn into bite-size pieces (2 cups)", "8 wonton wrappers (see Tip)", "Vegetable oil, for frying", "Salt", "2 romaine hearts, coarsely chopped", "4 scallions, coarsely chopped", "1 packed cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves with tender stems", "1 packed cup coarsely chopped fresh mint leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sesame oil, peach preserves, mayonnaise, soy sauce, chili powder and onion powder, and season to taste with salt.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the salad: Add the chicken to the dressing and toss."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To fry the wonton wrappers, cut the squares into 1/2-inch strips, then cut those strips in half crosswise to shorten them.
