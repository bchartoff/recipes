{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saut\u00e9ed Scallops Stuffed With Basil", "description": "Use the biggest scallops you can find for this recipe. They\u2019re easier to butterfly and more forgiving to cook (meaning that they take longer to overcook, which is the worst thing you can do here). If you happen to cut the scallops all the way through, sandwich them back together around the basil; scallops have enough gelatin to more or less stick to themselves. This recipe can also be made with pesto, but homemade pesto takes a bit of time, and the scallops cook in no time at all, so the pesto sort of slows the recipe down. A whole basil leaf serves the same purpose and is much quicker. Serve the scallops on a bed of mixed greens. Deglazing the pan with lemon juice is a nice touch; the warm dressing on cool greens is a treat. And you can use wine, stock, soy sauce or any number of other liquids to play around with the flavor of the dish as you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/scallops/scallops-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "low-carb, low-fat, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 73}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 208, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "624 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["20 large fresh basil leaves", "1 small clove garlic, peeled", "1/2 teaspoon coarse salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds fairly uniform large sea scallops", "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "4 to 6 cups mixed greens, washed and dried"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mince the basil, garlic, salt and pepper together until very fine, almost a puree (or use a small food processor).
