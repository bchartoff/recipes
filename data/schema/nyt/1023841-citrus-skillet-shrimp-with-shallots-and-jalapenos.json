{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Citrus Skillet Shrimp With Shallots and Jalape\u00f1os", "description": "Inspired by the bright, refreshing flavors of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/search?q=ceviche\">ceviche</a>, this recipe takes advantage of an abundance of winter citrus to season pan-cooked shrimp, cooking it until tender and warm rather than curing it simply using salt and acidity and without the application of heat, as classic ceviches do. Shallots and jalape\u00f1os quickly bathe in orange and lime juice to cut the rawness and heat of each. You can substitute chopped scallions for the shallots, and white fish or scallops are easy stand-ins for shrimp. Best enjoyed with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019204-basic-stovetop-rice\">rice</a> and a simple lettuce salad with avocado and a mustard vinaigrette, this vibrant, colorful dish can brighten up even the dreariest of cold days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/19/multimedia/yf-citrus-skillet-shrimp-wblf/yf-citrus-skillet-shrimp-wblf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, citrus, easy, ground cumin, jalape\u00f1o, lime, orange, shallot, shrimp, skillet, smoked paprika, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 727}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 navel orange, zested and juiced (see Tip)", "2 limes, zested and juiced (see Tip)", "1 medium shallot, cut into thin rings", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and finely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "Kosher salt", "1/2 packed cup fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 1/2 pounds large peeled, deveined shrimp (tails on or off)", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "2 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine the orange and lime zest and juice with the shallot, jalape\u00f1o, cumin and \u00bd teaspoon salt; stir to combine.
