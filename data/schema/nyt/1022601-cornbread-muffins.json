{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cornbread Muffins", "description": "Ubiquitous on southern tables, cornbread is a versatile side dish that can be cut into pieces from a cast-iron skillet or, as done in this recipe, portioned as individual muffins. This recipe by Alexander Smalls, a chef, author, restaurateur and former opera singer, uses finely ground cornmeal and two types of milk to create a savory batter, which also gets a kick from coriander. Fresh corn kernels add texture to the dense quickbread. Serve warm alongside a spread of vegetables or a meat dish, with plenty of butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Korsha Wilson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/06/dining/04TERRYREX2-cornbread-muffins/04TERRYREX2-cornbread-muffins-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "side dish", "keywords": "buttermilk, corn, cornmeal, muffin, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 239}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray (optional)", "1/2 cup/70 grams fine cornmeal, preferably white (see Tip)", "1/2 cup/64 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons light brown sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whole milk", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters buttermilk", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup/90 grams fresh or thawed frozen corn kernels"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
