{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Fish With Soy and Citrus", "description": "For those curious about cooking a whole fish but nervous to try, this skillet method is as simple as cooking a chicken breast. Meant to work with a larger fish, such as a snapper or black bass, this method, which keeps the skin and bones involved, prevents overcooking and drying out (plus it's more fun to eat). Basted with a citrusy browned butter-soy mixture, which also acts as a sauce once the fish is cooked, this one-skillet dish needs little more than some spriggy, fresh herbs for nibbling on alongside, but feel free to serve with a big leafy salad, bowl of rice or thick-cut toast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/dining/23Romanrex1/merlin_148945323_3aa45d42-3e15-4efa-8700-2a4f22910719-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, seafood", "keywords": "lemon, lime, orange, red snapper, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 366}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 481, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "60 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "894 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "1 lime plus 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "1 orange", "1 red snapper (about 2 1/2 pounds), gutted and scaled (optional to keep the head on)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce or tamari", "Flaky sea salt", "1/2 bunch cilantro or parsley, plus more if you like, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
