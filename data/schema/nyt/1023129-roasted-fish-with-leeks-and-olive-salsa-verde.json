A lemony olive salsa verde adds brightness to the dish, while red-pepper flakes bring some heat. Serve this with rice, polenta or crusty bread to soak up the tangy-sweet juices. For a richer, more full-flavored variation, try salmon or tuna fillets instead of milder white fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/dining/15Apperex/merlin_205476471_804647a7-a9fe-4743-a238-9fe9ef536cb9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cod, leek, olives", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 267}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 thick fillets white fish, such as cod or halibut (about 1 1/2 pounds total)", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 medium leeks, trimmed, white and light green parts halved lengthwise and rinsed well", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 lemon", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped pitted Castelvetrano olives", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 garlic clove, finely grated, minced or pushed through a garlic press", "Large pinch of red-pepper flakes, or to taste", "Fine sea or table salt", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
