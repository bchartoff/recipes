{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mapo Tofu", "description": "You can order mapo tofu from many Chinese restaurants, but it\u2019s also quite doable at home. You can find the pivotal fermented chile and broad (fava) bean sauce or paste called doubanjiang (sometimes rendered as \u201ctoban djan\u201d) at a Chinese market. Look for a doubanjiang from Pixian, in Sichuan, and bear in mind that oilier versions have extra heat but may lack an earthy depth. Sichuan peppercorns add mala \u2014 tingly zing \u2014 and fermented black beans, called douchi, lend this dish a kick of umami. Ground beef is traditional, but many cooks choose pork; you can also try lamb, turkey thigh or a plant-based meat alternatives. Add chile flakes for extra fire, and balance mapo\u2019s intensity with rice and steamed or stir-fried broccoli.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Andrea Nguyen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/07/dining/05mapo1/merlin_177593325_1efeecd0-e478-4f8a-ab03-36a9553ca3c9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings (about 4 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, grains and rice, meat, one pot, main course", "keywords": "doubanjiang, ground beef, scallion, sichuan peppercorns, tofu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1907}, "recipeIngredient": ["16 ounces medium or medium-firm tofu (if unavailable, go with firm)", "1 rounded teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns", "3 tablespoons canola oil", "6 ounces ground beef or pork (preferably 80 or 85 percent lean), roughly chopped to loosen", "2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons doubanjiang (fermented chile bean sauce or paste)", "1 tablespoon douchi (fermented black beans, optional)", "1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "2 teaspoons regular soy sauce", "1 rounded teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more if needed", "Fine sea salt", "2 large scallions, trimmed and cut on a sharp bias into thin, 2-inch-long pieces", "1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in 3 tablespoons water", "Cooked white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the tofu: Cut the tofu into 3/4-inch cubes and put into a bowl.
