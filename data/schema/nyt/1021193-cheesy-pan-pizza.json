{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Pan Pizza", "description": "This recipe for a crisp, cheesy pan pizza was developed by Charlotte Rutledge, along with her team of test cooks at King Arthur Flour\u2019s rigorous test kitchen in Vermont. It uses a number of simple techniques to achieve maximum texture and flavor. The dough is folded a few times before it goes in the fridge for a long rest, which develops its flavor and airiness. Cooking the pizza in cast iron gets the edges brown and crackling, and layering the cheese and sauce creates an extra cheesy top with no soggy layer. Make it once in its simplest form, then use the model to play around with the fermentation time and toppings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/magazine/28mag-eat/28mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "1 (9-to-10-inch) pan pizza", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pizza and calzones, main course", "keywords": "active dry yeast, all-purpose flour, basil, instant yeast, mozzarella, parmesan, tomato sauce, yeast, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2842}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/240 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters lukewarm water", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon instant or active dry yeast", "1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil", "6 ounces mozzarella, grated (about 1 1/4 loosely packed cups)", "1/2 cup/120 grams tomato sauce or pizza sauce", "Freshly grated hard cheese, such as Parmesan or pecorino, for garnish (optional)", "Fresh herbs, such as basil, marjoram or oregano, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: Measure the flour, water, olive oil, salt and yeast into a large mixing bowl.

Transfer the dough to the pan, and turn it once to coat both sides with the oil. After coating the dough in oil, press the dough to the edges of the pan, dimpling it with your fingertips. If the dough shrinks back, cover it and let it rest for about 15 minutes, then repeat the pressing and dimpling. At this point, you should be able to smush the dough out and into the edges of the pan, but if not, give it one more 15-minute rest before trying again. Cover the dough, and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature. It will look soft and jiggle when you gently shake the pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place one rack at the bottom of the oven and one toward the top (about 4 to 5 inches from the top heating element), then heat the oven to 450 degrees. When you\u2019re ready to bake the pizza, sprinkle a scant 1 cup mozzarella evenly over the crust. Cover the entire dough so none is showing, then dollop small spoonfuls of the sauce over the cheese. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella on top, and bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and the bottom and edges of the crust are a rich golden brown. (Use a spatula to check the bottom.) If the bottom is brown but the top still seems pale, transfer the pizza to the top rack, and bake for 2 to 4 minutes longer. On the other hand, if the top seems fine but the bottom\u2019s not browned to your liking, leave the pizza on the bottom rack for another 2 to 4 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the pizza from the oven, and place the pan on a heatproof surface. Carefully run a table knife or spatula between the edge of the pizza and side of the pan to prevent the cheese from sticking as it cools. Let the pizza cool very briefly; as soon as you feel comfortable doing so, carefully transfer it from the pan to a cooling rack or cutting surface. If garnishing with hard cheese and herbs, add those now. Serve the pizza anywhere from medium-hot to warm, and use kitchen shears or a large pair of scissors to cut it into wedges."}], "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021193-cheesy-pan-pizza"}
