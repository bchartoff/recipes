{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fannie Farmer\u2019s Parker House Rolls", "description": "In 1896, Fannie Farmer, then principal of the Boston Cooking School, wrote and published a cookbook that revolutionized the way home cooks thought about cooking and housekeeping (she introduced the concept of using measuring cups and spoons, among other things). The book, originally titled \u201cThe Boston Cooking-School Cook Book,\u201d was a smash hit in the United States and became known simply as \u201cThe Fannie Farmer Cookbook.\u201d It is still in print. This classic recipe is an adaptation of one found in a revised edition by Marion Cunningham. It takes time but very little effort, and you will be rewarded with soft, pillowy, butter-rich rolls worthy of your best breadbasket.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": ""}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/26/dining/26COOKING_BISCUITS1/26COOKING_BISCUITS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "30 rolls", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 350}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 122, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "105 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons butter, at room temperature, plus 4 tablespoons melted butter for brushing dough", "2 tablespoons sugar", "2 teaspoons salt", "2 cups warm milk", "1 package dry yeast", "6 cups white flour, approximately"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix the 4 tablespoons room-temperature butter, the sugar, the salt and the warm milk in a large bowl and let cool to lukewarm."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir the yeast into 1/4 cup warm water and let it stand for 5 minutes to dissolve."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sponge: Add 3 cups flour and the dissolved yeast to the \u200bmilk\u200b mixture and beat vigorously for 2 minutes\u200b to form a loose batter.\u200b Cover and let rise in a warm place until double\u200bd\u200b in bulk, about 1 hour\u200b. \u200b\u200b\u200b"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir in the remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time to form a shaggy dough firm enough to knead.
