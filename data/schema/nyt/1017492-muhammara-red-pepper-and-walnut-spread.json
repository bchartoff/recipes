The version made with frozen peppers is a little looser and lighter in color than the version starting with fresh peppers, but otherwise you sacrifice nothing having started with frozen produce \u2014 the two final spreads are similar in taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/dining/08FREEZER5/08FREEZER5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, bell pepper, walnut, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 361}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 168, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "142 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large fresh red bell pepper, roasted (see note), or 1 chopped frozen red bell pepper, thawed", "1/2 cup chopped scallions (3 to 4 scallions)", "1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "3 teaspoons pomegranate molasses", "1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (preferably Marash or Aleppo), more to taste", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "3/4 cup walnuts, lightly toasted", "4 to 6 tablespoons fresh bread crumbs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine pepper, scallions, lemon juice, cumin, salt, 2 teaspoons pomegranate molasses, \u00bd teaspoon red pepper flakes, 4 tablespoons olive oil and all but 2 of the walnuts in a food processor and pur\u00e9e until mostly smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add 4 tablespoons bread crumbs and pulse to combine.
