{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carne Asada Lorenza", "description": "For centuries, Sonoran carne asada tacos have traditionally been assembled in flour tortillas. However, the corn tortilla, salted and crisped on the same grill that cooks and seasons the meat, has been added to the mix, creating a crunchy open taco called the Carne Asada Lorenza. Not only is it a sight to behold, but it has become such a favorite that it\u2019s starting to rival the flour tortilla taco. Once the corn tortilla is seasoned and grilled, it is slathered with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021290-refried-beans\">refried beans</a>, mounted with copious amounts of melty cheese, and placed back on the grill for the cheese to ooze all over. The taco base becomes a sumptuous bed for the carne asada. Finish it with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021291-fire-roasted-salsa\">fire-roasted salsa</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021293-guacamole\">guacamole</a>, and you will see what the Lorenza hype is all about.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10Carneasadarex1-lorenzo/merlin_175265211_99d91d6a-ec87-42e7-a9c5-a28ac31dacd3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, tacos, main course", "keywords": "beef, cheese, chuck steak, corn tortillas, onion, sirloin, tortilla", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 390}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 large white onion, for cleaning the grill", "Beef fat (cut from the meat, if fatty), tallow or vegetable oil, for greasing the grill", "2 pounds chuck roll, sliced into 1/2-inch steaks", "2 pounds top sirloin, sliced into 1/2-inch steaks", "4 teaspoons kosher or sea salt (about 1 teaspoon per pound of meat), or to taste, plus more for salting tortillas", "12 corn tortillas", "Frijoles de Fiesta (Fiesta Refried Beans)\u00a0(<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021290-refried-beans\">see recipe</a>)", "12 ounces asadero, quesadilla, Monterey Jack or Oaxaca cheese, grated (about 3 cups)", "Salsa Tatemada Norte\u00f1a (Fire-Roasted Salsa)\u00a0(<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021291-fire-roasted-salsa\">see recipe</a>)", "Chile Verde Guacamole (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021293-guacamole\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start a charcoal or gas grill, and get it very hot.
