His bright take on frijoles puercos, or pork and beans, is inspired by a version he once tasted in northern Mexico. It involves butter beans simmered with chile and onion until tender and plump, mixed up with crumbled chorizo and scrambled eggs. The result is a delicious, one-pot meal with a fresh garnish of cheese and herbs, and it makes for an ideal breakfast, lunch or dinner, ideally with a stack of warm tortillas on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/28/magazine/28eat1/28eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "beans", "keywords": "bacon, butter beans, chorizo sausage, guajillo chiles", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 248}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces (1 cup) dried butter beans", "1 white onion, halved", "3 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 dried guajillo chile", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 slices bacon, chopped", "1/2 teaspoon chile powder", "8 ounces Mexican chorizo, casings removed", "6 eggs", "Queso fresco, crumbled", "Cilantro leaves, chopped", "Spring onions, sliced", "1 pickled jalape\u00f1o, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, combine beans with 5 cups water, half the onion, the garlic and chile.
