The recipe is for marmalade devotees who want a surprise: you\u2019ll cut the Meyer lemon into chunks, so when you eat the marmalade, you get a burst of lemon, a bit of culinary sunshine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/22/dining/Marmalade/Marmalade-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Makes 6 8-ounce jars of marmalade", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments, dips and spreads, project", "keywords": "grapefruit, lemon juice, meyer lemon, sugar, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 51}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 871, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "226 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "218 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 pounds grapefruit, rinsed", "5 Meyer lemons or small regular lemons, rinsed", "1/2 cup lemon juice (from 2 to 3 additional lemons)", "2 1/2 pounds sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the grapefruit skin with a vegetable peeler.
