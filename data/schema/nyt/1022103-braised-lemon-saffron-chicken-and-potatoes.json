{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Lemon-Saffron Chicken and Potatoes", "description": "In this comforting braise, bone-in chicken and potatoes slowly cook in a lively lemon-saffron bath until the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender and the potatoes are soft and full of flavor. Most of the work in this one-pot dinner happens in the oven, so you can rest or multitask as it cooks. Serve it with rice and spoon the pan juices over top, or with toasted pita to soak up the rich, lemony broth. The whole peppercorns taste delicious and soften in both texture and flavor during the cooking process, but if they are too strong for you, leave them out or crack them before cooking. Leftovers are even better the next day, on top of a salad or tucked into a sandwich.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/15/dining/yk-lemon-saffron-chicken/yk-lemon-saffron-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, lemon, pepper, potato, saffron", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1234}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 heaping teaspoon saffron threads", "2 tablespoons hot (not boiling) water", "3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts, preferably thighs and drumsticks", "1/2 pound yellow or red baby potatoes", "3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from 4 to 6 lemons)", "1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns (optional)", "Cooked rice or toasted pita, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
