{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet and Spicy Fruit Salad", "description": "Most fruit salads consist of little more than diced fruit mixed in a bowl. They are simple and satisfying, but not necessarily special. This one is a more sophisticated take. It calls for a star anise- and chile-infused simple syrup, which adds sweetness and musky, spicy complexity. In addition to fruit, herbs \u2013 tarragon and basil \u2013 are tossed in for freshness. You can use whatever fruit you like as long as it is sweet and ripe. Eat the salad as it is, or top it with either mascarpone for a mellow, creamy note, or crumbled ricotta salata for something savory and bracing. Feel free to play around with other toppings as well. In the mellow category are fresh ricotta, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, sour cream or ice cream. For something on the salty side, try shaved Parmesan, crumbled feta or goat cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/dining/15APPE1/15APPE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "fruit, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 305}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 102, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "307 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup granulated sugar", "1 serrano chile, halved", "1 whole dried star anise\u00a0", "7 to 8 cups mixed cut fruit, like kiwi, peaches, plums, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, mango, pineapple, oranges, grapefruit, pears or bananas", "2 teaspoons chopped tarragon", "2 teaspoons chopped basil\u00a0", "Flaky sea salt, to taste\u00a0", "Black pepper, to taste\u00a0", "Mascarpone or crumbled ricotta salata, for garnish\u00a0(optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place sugar, 3/4 cup water, chile and star anise in a small pot and bring to a boil.
