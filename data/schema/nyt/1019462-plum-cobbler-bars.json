{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Plum Cobbler Bars", "description": "What's not to love about a juicy plum filling surrounded by plenty of buttery streusel? In this simple recipe, you have to cook down the plums to be thick enough, but the process is relatively hands off, and the flavor of the slow-simmered fruit is well worth it. You can cut the cobbler easily into bars, as the name implies, but the filling stays a bit soft, so you may prefer to eat them with a fork. They're excellent with ice cream, but many like them best topped with a drizzle of cold heavy cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/dining/mcdowell_plumbars_horizontal/merlin_141963915_5e6fee1b-577d-406a-b880-8c10b1704c38-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, plum", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 432}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 673, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "109 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "200 milligrams", "sugarContent": "66 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 pounds/about 1 kilogram red, black or purple plums, pits removed and roughly chopped (about 6 cups)", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams plus 1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams cornstarch", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "3 cups/240 grams old-fashioned oats", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/90 grams whole-wheat flour", "1 1/2 cups/330 grams light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams unsalted butter (3 sticks), melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, combine plums and 1 1/2 cups/300 grams\u00a0granulated sugar.
