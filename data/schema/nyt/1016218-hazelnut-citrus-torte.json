{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hazelnut Citrus Torte", "description": "A touch of quinoa flour gives this hazelnut torte an underlying smokiness that makes it more complex than most. It also makes it both gluten-free and kosher for Passover. But if you can\u2019t find quinoa flour, millet flour will work well, too, as would wheat flour (though of course it would no longer be gluten-free). With a supple, moist crumb, this torte will keep for several days, well-wrapped at room temperature, so feel free to make it ahead. Then serve it with a citrus sorbet or sweet citrus salad and a mound of whipped cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or mascarpone.
