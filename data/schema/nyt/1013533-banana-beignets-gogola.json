{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banana Beignets (Gogola)", "description": "These tender banana doughnuts are traditionally prepared for Phagwah (called Holi in India), a Hindu holiday celebrated in Trinidad and Guyana that commemorates the escape of the prince Prahlada from the burning lap of the demoness Holika. A kadhai, an all-purpose domed pot like a Chinese wok, is used to deep-fry a batter of ripe bananas, flour and sugar into plump bites called gogola. The batter is scented with mixed essence, a popular Caribbean flavoring with notes of vanilla, almond and cinnamon. Mixed essence is meant to replicate the scent of the South American tonka bean, which is rare and expensive (and illegal to use as a flavoring in the United States because it contains a chemical the Food and Drug Administration considers dangerous).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/Banana-Beignets/Banana-Beignets-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "About 5 dozen gogolas", "recipeCuisine": "indian, southern", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "banana, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 69, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "10 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 very ripe bananas (brown, not black)", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/8 teaspoon almond extract", "3/4 cup sugar", "3 cups flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 large pinch freshly grated nutmeg", "1 large pinch ground cinnamon", "1/4 cup (or more) evaporated milk", "Vegetable oil for frying", "Powdered sugar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a potato masher or large fork, mash the bananas in a large bowl.
