{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pomegranate Baked Rice and Onions With Dill", "description": "This tangy-sweet casserole is adapted from Shimi Aaron, an Israeli chef also known for his elaborate chocolate babkas. In this colorful dish, a layer of short-grain rice studded with pine nuts and dill is bathed in pomegranate juice and honey, and topped with shingles of red and yellow onions. When it emerges from the oven, the onions glisten like jewels, and the rice is fragrant, tender and a little sticky. Serve this as a meatless main course with a crisp salad, or as scene-stealing side dish alongside a simple roast chicken or fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/06/dining/01Apperex/merlin_204710211_c3151d4c-c328-428f-8f02-4a15336a6d39-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, grains and rice, main course", "keywords": "dill, onion, rice, passover, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 393}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter or vegan butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "3 medium yellow onion, peeled", "2 medium red onions, peeled", "1 3/4 teaspoons fine sea or table salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup pine nuts", "6 small or 3 large shallots, thinly sliced", "1 cup Arborio or other short-grain rice", "1 tablespoon <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021924-baharat-blend\">baharat</a> (or use another aromatic spice blend, such as garam masala)", "1 cup coarsely chopped dill (or use any combination of dill, cilantro and mint), plus more for serving", "1 1/2 cups unsweetened pomegranate juice", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons honey or agave", "1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper", "Plain Greek yogurt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or large, shallow gratin dish."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Coarsely chop one of the yellow onions.
