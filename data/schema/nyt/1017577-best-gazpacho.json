{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Best Gazpacho", "description": "More of a drink than a soup, served in frosted glasses or chilled tumblers, gazpacho is perfect when it is too hot to eat but you need cold, salt and lunch all at the same time. Gazpacho is everywhere in Seville, Spain, where this recipe comes from, but it's not the watered-down salsa or grainy vegetable pur\u00e9e often served in the United States. This version has no bread and is a creamy orange-pink rather than a lipstick red. That is because a large quantity of olive oil is required for making delicious gazpacho, rather than take-it-or-leave it gazpacho. The emulsion of red tomato juice, palest green cucumber juice and golden olive oil produces the right color and a smooth, almost fluffy texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/25/dining/jm-best-gazpacho/jm-best-gazpacho-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings, about 1 quart", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, cucumber, sherry vinegar, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3881}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 122, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "365 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 2 pounds ripe red tomatoes, cored and roughly cut into chunks", "1 Italian frying (cubanelle) pepper or another long, light green pepper, such as Anaheim, cored, seeded and roughly cut into chunks", "1 cucumber, about 8 inches long, peeled and roughly cut into chunks", "1 small mild onion (white or red), peeled and roughly cut into chunks", "1 clove garlic", "2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, more to taste", "Salt", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more to taste, plus more for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, onion and garlic in a blender or, if using a hand blender, in a deep bowl.
