{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Calabrian Meatballs", "description": "Featured in my cookbook, \u201cHeirloom Kitchen: Heritage Recipes and Family Stories from the Tables of Immigrant Women\u201d (Harper Design, 2019), this polpette recipe comes from my grandmother\u2019s Calabrian kitchen. The sugo di pomodoro, or tomato sauce, delivers complex flavor, serving as the poaching liquid for the delicate meatballs and as an essential ingredient in the meatballs themselves, adding both flavor and juiciness. Lightened further with milk and Italian bread crumbs, the meatballs are incredibly tender, bursting at the touch of your fork. The recipe yields a crowd-serving portion, perfect for Sunday dinner, but also freezes beautifully. Though the sauce may be tossed with your favorite pasta, this dish is the ideal version of a traditional platter of meatballs, covered in sauce and garnished with cheese and basil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Anna Francese Gass"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/16/dining/afg-calabrian-meatballs/merlin_213230247_8a07598f-5397-4d9b-a3d3-ba86f34433e0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 16 meatballs and 7 cups sauce", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meatballs, main course", "keywords": "basil, crushed canned tomato, freezer friendly, ground beef, ground pork, ground veal, make-ahead, pecorino romano", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 830}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 fresh basil leaves", "\u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly smashed", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "2 (28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes (8 cups)", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "\u00bd pound ground pork", "\u00bd pound ground veal", "\u00bd pound ground beef (preferably 15-percent fat)", "1 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus more for serving", "1 cup seasoned Italian bread crumbs\u00a0", "\u00bd cup whole milk", "\u00bd cup tomato sauce (reserved from recipe above), cooled", "2 large eggs, beaten", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves (optional)", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the sauce: Tear 5 basil leaves in half; reserve the rest.
