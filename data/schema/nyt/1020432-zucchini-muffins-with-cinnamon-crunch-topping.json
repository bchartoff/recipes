{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Zucchini Muffins With Cinnamon Crunch Topping", "description": "A touch of honey complements the nutty flavor of the whole-wheat flour in these muffins. The zucchini and applesauce provide moisture and flavor, and the crunchy cinnamon topping makes for the perfect textural contrast against the soft cake. These muffins are a great addition to your morning cup of coffee. Store them on the counter, uncovered, to help preserve their crunchy coating. They also freeze well and can be reheated in a low-temperature oven or thawed at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/27/dining/jg-zucchini-muffins/jg-zucchini-muffins-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack, finger foods, pastries", "keywords": "applesauce, cinnamon, honey, turbinado sugar, whole wheat flour, zucchini, fall, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 136}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons/30 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus 1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter, melted", "2 medium zucchini (about 1 pound)", "1 cup/120 grams plus 1 tablespoon whole-wheat flour", "1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters whole milk, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters unsweetened applesauce", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters honey", "2 eggs, beaten, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/3 cup/65 grams turbinado sugar", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
