{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peanut Butter-Glazed Salmon and Green Beans", "description": "This fast and fun weeknight meal reveals an unexpected use for peanut butter, transforming it into a savory five-ingredient sauce. The pantry favorite is combined with tangy lemon juice, fragrant ginger and toasted sesame oil to create a rich, supernutty glaze that pairs well with fatty salmon. Here the salmon is roasted on a rack of green beans, but a bed of broccoli florets would be an excellent alternative. The sweet-salty glaze can be made a day ahead and brought to room temperature before using.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/14/dining/kc-peanut-sauce-salmon-with-green-beans/kc-peanut-sauce-salmon-with-green-beans-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "green beans, peanut butter, salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1313}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound green beans, trimmed", "1 bunch scallions (about 6), halved lengthwise then cut crosswise into thirds", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "Salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup smooth peanut butter (either conventional or natural works)", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving", "2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "1 tablespoon grated peeled ginger", "1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "4 (6-ounce) center-cut salmon fillets", "1/4 cup chopped unsalted roasted peanuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
