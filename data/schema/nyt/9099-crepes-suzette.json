For one thing, you can make the crepes in advance; they could sit, piled between torn-off sheets of baking parchment and well wrapped in the refrigerator, for a good three days without coming to any harm. But I must admit to taking, more than once, an even quicker route: using good store-bought crepes. Once they're immersed in the sweet orangey syrup, they will not betray their prefabricated origins.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/28/dining/28COOKING-CREPES-SUZETTE1/28COOKING-CREPES-SUZETTE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "crepes, grand marnier, orange, dessert, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 97}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 436, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "282 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice", "Finely grated zest of 1 orange", "10 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/3 cup superfine sugar", "8 to 12 crepes (see <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9100-crepes\">recipe</a>)", "1/3 cup Grand Marnier, Cointreau or triple sec liqueur"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, combine orange juice, zest, butter and sugar.
