Extremely moist, it consists of two seeded oranges (peel and all), ground almonds, sugar and eggs \u2013 and no flour. Baked in a hot oven, it will be done in just about an hour or so, longer if the orange pulp is extremely wet. Opening the oven door to check will not harm it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Moira Hodgson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/11/dining/almondorange/almondorange-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, times classics", "keywords": "dairy-free, vegetarian, dessert, eggs, ground almonds, orange", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1198}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 274, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "73 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large oranges", "6 eggs", "1/2 pound ground almonds", "1/2 pound sugar", "1 teaspoon baking powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the oranges and simmer them, unpeeled, in water to cover for 2 hours.
