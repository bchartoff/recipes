{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Italian Fennel Sausage", "description": "Make this simple fennel-scented sausage to toss into pasta or onto pizza. Par-cook large crumbles to fold into Thanksgiving stuffing or a pot of soup. Or fry up patties and serve alongside crusty bread and a bowl of tender white beans doused generously in olive oil.  Be sure to use ground pork with enough fat or you'll end up with dry, flavorless sausage. Twenty percent by weight is a good ratio, though 25 doesn\u2019t hurt. If the ground pork available to you is too lean, ask the butcher to replace two ounces or so of the lean meat with ground pork belly or bacon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/05/magazine/05eat3/05eat3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "sausages", "keywords": "fennel seeds, ground pork, white wine, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 80}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "275 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground fennel seed", "1/2 to 1 tablespoon red-pepper flakes", "1 pound ground pork (20 to 25 percent fat by weight)", "1 teaspoon pounded or very finely grated garlic", "1 teaspoon dry white wine or vermouth", "Extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine salt, fennel seed and red-pepper flakes.
