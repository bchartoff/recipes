The binder can be milk, broth, cream or, as in this case, the natural juices of vegetables like tomatoes and onions. With less liquid, this gratin is more foolproof than most. Anchovies give the dish a South of France funk, but you can leave them and the cheese out to make a vegan gratin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/05/dining/31COOKING-POTATO-GRATIN2/31COOKING-POTATO-GRATIN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french, provencal", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "anchovies, parmigiano-reggiano, potato, tomato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 321}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "814 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 onions, thinly sliced (2 heaping cups)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes, seeded and cut into strips about 3/8-inch wide", "1 2-ounce can anchovies packed in olive oil, drained (reserve anchovies and oil separately)", "2 large cloves garlic, smashed and peeled", "1 tablespoon fresh herbs, such as thyme, oregano or savory, or 1 teaspoon dried herbes de Provence", "About 2 pounds thin-skinned, waxy potatoes like Yukon Gold, sliced 1/8-inch thick (6 to 7 cups)", "1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Gruy\u00e8re\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees and place a rack at the middle level.
