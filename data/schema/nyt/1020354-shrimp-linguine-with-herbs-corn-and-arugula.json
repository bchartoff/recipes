{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp Linguine With Herbs, Corn and Arugula", "description": "The beauty of this pasta lies in its ease: Combine fresh, seasonal ingredients and let them shine. Here, shrimp is saut\u00e9ed in butter until just cooked through, then set aside while the rest of the dish comes together. Peppery arugula, sweet corn and an abundance of fresh herbs round out this easy-to-assemble dinner, which is perfect after a long day at the beach or even just the office. Seared scallops would work well in place of shrimp, or you could try a combination of the two. Herbs, too, are up to you: Basil screams summer, but tarragon and Italian parsley would also be nice. White wine is used to make a light sauce for the pasta; you know what to do with any extra.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/16/dining/ch-shrimp-pasta-with-arugula-and-corn/merlin_157887831_c0b688ec-3ba6-4442-81f0-cb3f29eb4a4b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas, seafood, vegetables", "keywords": "arugula, butter, corn, herbs, pasta, shrimp, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 275}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "12 ounces linguine or spaghetti", "1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails removed, if you prefer", "Black pepper", "1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick)", "2 cups fresh corn kernels (from 2 to 3 ears)", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 cup dry white wine", "8 ounces baby arugula, spinach or other tender greens", "2 cups loosely packed, roughly chopped tender herbs, such as basil and mint", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
