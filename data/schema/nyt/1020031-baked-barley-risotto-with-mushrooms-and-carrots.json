{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Barley Risotto With Mushrooms and Carrots", "description": "Wholesome and nutty, barley is a superb alternative to arborio rice in this risotto, since it\u2019s naturally plump and chewy when cooked. The grated Parmesan and butter stirred in at the end release the barley\u2019s starches, creating a silky, creamy texture. Make sure to use pearl barley, not hulled, since it cooks much faster and is more tender. As for the mushrooms, white button, cremini and earthy shiitakes are a tasty, accessible mix, though any combination of oyster, king trumpet and maitake would raise the bar. Still, the best thing about this risotto, which is a satisfying vegetarian weeknight dinner (or side to any large roast or fish) is that it\u2019s baked, taking away the pressure of constant stirring at the stove.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/09/dining/kc-barley-risotto/kc-barley-risotto-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, vegetables", "keywords": "cremini, mushroom, parmesan, pearl barley, risotto, shiitake, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 774}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 505, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "16 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "632 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 small white or yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1/2 cup)", "5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 pound mixed mushrooms, such as white button, cremini and shiitakes, halved if small, quartered if large (about 7 cups total)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "10 ounces pearl barley (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 medium carrot, very thinly sliced into rounds (about 1 cup)", "2 ounces grated Parmesan (about 1/2 cup), plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
