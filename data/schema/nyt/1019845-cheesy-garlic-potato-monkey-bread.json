{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Garlic-Potato Monkey Bread", "description": "This savory monkey bread begins with a yeasted dough made with mashed potatoes, which helps make it the extra light and fluffy. Each round of dough is coated in garlic butter, cheese (Parmesan and white cheddar), and a generous dose of coarse black pepper. Think of it as cacio e pepe monkey bread. It\u2019s best served warm. The dough rises overnight in the refrigerator, which makes this recipe especially great when you\u2019re looking to plan ahead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/13/dining/em-cheesy-monkey-bread/em-cheesy-monkey-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, cheddar, flour, garlic powder, parmesan, potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 80}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 595, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "469 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 1/2 cups/576 grams all-purpose flour, plus additional for coating", "1/2 cup/60 grams finely grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup/55 grams light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon garlic powder", "2 teaspoons instant yeast", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick), at room temperature, plus more for greasing", "3/4 cup/163 grams leftover mashed potatoes or 1 small russet potato, peeled, chopped and boiled", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters warm water (about 95 degrees)", "1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk", "Cooking spray, for greasing", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick)", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "1 cup/120 grams finely grated Parmesan", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/128 grams shredded white cheddar", "1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough the day before you want to make the monkey bread: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the flour, Parmesan, sugar, garlic powder, yeast and salt on low speed to combine, 15 to 20 seconds."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the butter, mashed potato, water, egg and egg yolk.
