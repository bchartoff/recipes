It will keep in the refrigerator for a week or so. Be certain to cover it well with plastic wrap to keep it from absorbing other flavors in the refrigerator.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacques Pepin"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chocolate, eggs, instant coffee, dessert, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 278, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "60 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups whole or skim milk", "1 tablespoon instant coffee", "1 whole egg plus 2 egg yolks", "1/4 cup sugar", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "7 ounces bittersweet chocolate, broken into a few pieces", "1 ounce unsweetened (bitter) chocolate"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring the milk and instant coffee to a boil in a saucepan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, place the egg, egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and mix well.
