{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cresp\u00e9u", "description": "Cresp\u00e9u is a traditional Proven\u00e7al dish consisting of several frittatas layered one on top of the other. On my summer trips to Provence over the last few years I\u2019ve noticed that the dish has become popular in charcuteries, baked in breadpan-shaped terrines and sold by the slice. These usually consist of three or four different types of frittata and they are different from the stack of thin frittatas that I learned to make years ago. Traditionally you would make these simply by making the frittatas, leaving them a little runny on the top and stacking them, then finishing the stack in the oven or just weighting it with a plate and chilling. But it\u2019s easier and faster (though still quite time consuming) if you\u2019re making the cresp\u00e9u in a breadpan or tureen to cook the eggs and filling like runny scrambled eggs and layer each batch in a breadpan, then bake in a water bath. You can use 3 eggs in each batch instead of 4, but the layers will be thinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/17/science/23recipehealth/23recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 10", "recipeCuisine": "provencal", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "eggs, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 24}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ingredients for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014982/Onion-and-Zucchini-Frittata-to-Go.html\">Onion and Zucchini Frittata to Go,</a> using 3 eggs instead of 4 if desired", "Ingredients for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014980/Tomato-Frittata-to-Go.html\">Tomato Frittata to Go,</a> using 3 eggs instead of 4 if desired", "Ingredients for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014983/Greens-and-Garlic-Frittata-to-Go.html\">Greens and Garlic Frittata to Go,</a> using 3 eggs instead of 4 if desired", "Ingredients for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014981/Frittata-With-Peas-Herbs-and-Feta-or-Parmesan.html\">Frittata to Go with Peas, Herbs and Feta or Parmesan,</a> using 3 eggs instead of 4 if desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Method 1: Cresp\u00e9u Terrine", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
