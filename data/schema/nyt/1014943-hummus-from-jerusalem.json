The unusual yet helpful addition of baking soda speeds the process. Cooking the chickpeas with baking soda softens them, allowing for less time on the stove as well as a smoother, creamier finished product. (If you find that your hummus is too stiff, loosen it with a little water.) A plate of this hummus served with fresh pita, chopped olives and pine nuts makes for a perfect lunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/31/dining/31JERUSALEM3/31JPJERUSALEM3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1029}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 645, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "409 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups dried chickpeas (250 grams)", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons light tahini paste (270 grams)", "4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice", "4 cloves garlic, crushed", "Salt", "6 1/2 tablespoons ice-cold water (100 milliliters)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put chickpeas in a large bowl and cover with cold water at least twice their volume.
