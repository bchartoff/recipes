So we add it to taste, a tablespoon or so at a time. If you don\u2019t have access to a grill, you can use your broiler or even a stovetop flame to char the tomatillos and jalape\u00f1os. It is excellent as an accompaniment to barbecued or grilled meats and folds into a taco nicely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/30/magazine/charred-tomatillo-jaew/charred-tomatillo-jaew-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6-8", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "guajillo chiles, jalape\u00f1o, tomatillo", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 16}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 46, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1240 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium-size onions, peeled and halved", "8 tomatillos, husks removed", "4 jalape\u00f1o peppers", "4 dried guajillo chiles", "6 cloves garlic, peeled", "2 stalks lemongrass, tender part only, peeled, halved and thinly sliced into half-moons", "1 tablespoon palm or light-brown sugar", "6 to 8 tablespoons fish sauce", "6 to 8 tablespoons lime juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set broiler to high or light an outdoor grill.
