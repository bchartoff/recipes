{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp and White Beans With Fennel and Pancetta", "description": "This quick, one-pan meal relies heavily on pantry staples. Browning pancetta or bacon adds richness to the tomato sauce, but skip it if you like. Anise-flavored fennel and seeds are incorporated into the soffrito, which plays nicely with the sweetness of the shrimp and the creaminess of the beans. But if you don\u2019t like them, leave them out. Serve the dish in deep bowls with thick slices of garlic-rubbed toast, finish the dish with a flurry of fresh herbs, and pair it with a glass of something red, light and bright.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/11/dining/ch-shrimp-and-white-beans-with-fennel-and-pancetta/merlin_149536275_1148132f-65cd-475b-a3b3-2695c3a1bfe0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "fennel, pancetta, shrimp, white beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 666}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 380, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1187 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling (optional)", "4 ounces pancetta or bacon, diced", "1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced", "1 small or medium fennel bulb (about 6 ounces), tough outer leaves and stems discarded and thinly sliced crosswise, plus 1 tablespoon roughly chopped fronds", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons fennel seeds", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes with their juices, tomatoes crushed by hand", "1 pound jumbo shrimp, preferably wild, peeled and deveined", "1 (15-ounce) can white beans, such as butter beans or cannellini beans, drained and rinsed", "1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh herbs, such as Italian parsley, basil, mint or a combination (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a deep 12-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over medium.
