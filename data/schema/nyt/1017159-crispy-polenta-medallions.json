{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Polenta Medallions", "description": "Anson Mills polenta, once it stiffens, is particularly well suited to this recipe for crispy rounds, though any polenta will work. The Anson Mills remains very creamy on the inside and crisps up beautifully on the surface. Make sure to cook these long enough in the oil \u2013 they should be a deep golden brown, and crispy. I topped the hot medallions with a dab of blue cheese, which softened and partially melted onto the crisp surface; heaven. I also love romesco with these, as well as green pipian and simple marinara sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/24/science/recipehealthmedallions/recipehealthmedallions-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 12 as an hors d\u2019oeuvre", "recipeCuisine": "american, mediterranean, mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 62}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 recipe <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017155-simple-pencil-cob-breakfast-grits\">Soft Anson Mills Polenta</a>", "2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil, as needed", "Blue cheese or gorgonzola (about 1 ounce)", "Romesco Sauce (about 1/4 cup)", "Marinara Sauce (about 1/4 cup)", "Green Pipian (about 1/4 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cover a baking sheet with plastic or lightly oil a baking dish.
