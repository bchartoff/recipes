{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Cod With Buttery Cracker Topping", "description": "Baked, stuffed fish is an old-school restaurant staple in New England; covered in lemony, butter-soaked cracker crumbs, it\u2019s a wonderful way to eat mild white fish like cod or haddock. The dish has a long history and relies on two ingredients New Englanders have in abundance: fresh seafood and crackers, which are descended from sailors\u2019 hardtack. Fannie Farmer\u2019s 1896 \u201cBoston Cooking-School Cook Book\u201d has a recipe for cracker-stuffed halibut, seasoned with butter, salt, pepper and onion juice. Some modern versions use saltines, others use butter crackers like Ritz, and many enrich the crackers with crab meat. This recipe is an easy weeknight variation: Instead of rolling the fish up around the stuffing, which requires long, thin filets, it is generously covered in the stuffing and roasted until the cracker topping is toasted and the fish flakes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/25/dining/sd-baked-cod/merlin_200474931_b3f82c6a-e7d8-461b-aac3-700d8e191452-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cod, crackers, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 970}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces butter-flavored crackers, such as Ritz (about 1\u00bd sleeves; 1\u00bd cups crushed)", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\u00a0", "1/4 cup minced fresh chives", "1/4 cup minced flat-leaf parsley", "1/2 lemon, zest and juice, plus more lemon wedges for serving", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "4 (6- to 8-ounce) fillets of cod, haddock, halibut or other white fish", "Coarse kosher salt and black pepper\u00a0", "Sweet paprika, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
