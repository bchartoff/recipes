{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Chicken Ramen With Bok Choy and Miso", "description": "The slow cooker puts a weeknight ramen fix within reach; don't skimp on the toppings here, which you can customize to your liking. They make each bowl feel special. Miso soup is traditionally made with dashi, an umami-rich stock made from kombu seaweed and dried bonito, a kind of tuna. But this recipe takes a different path to those deep flavors, substituting chicken broth and optional dried shiitake mushrooms, found in the produce department or international aisle of many grocery stores. Finally, a quick kombu steep adds umami. The ingredient is available at more specialty grocers and online, but feel free to leave it out. The soup will still be delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/dining/sd-miso-chicken-ramen/sd-miso-chicken-ramen-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 5 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, noodles, soups and stews", "keywords": "bok choy, chicken legs, kombo, mirin, miso, scallion, shiitake, tamari, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 461}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1171, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "60 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "71 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "70 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "3198 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 3 1/2 pounds skin-on whole chicken legs (about 5 legs)", "1/2 heaping cup sweet white or yellow miso, plus more to taste", "2 scallions, trimmed and halved, plus more for topping", "3 garlic cloves, smashed", "4 dried shiitake mushrooms (optional)", "1 (5-by-3-inch) piece dried kombu (optional)", "1 pound baby bok choy, cored and roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons tamari, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons mirin, plus more to taste", "12 to 16 ounces ramen, cooked and drained", "Soft boiled eggs, sesame seeds and toasted nori sheets, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the chicken legs in a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker, and crumble the miso on top.
