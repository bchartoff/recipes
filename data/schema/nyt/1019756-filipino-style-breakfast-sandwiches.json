{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Filipino-Style Breakfast Sandwiches", "description": "Breakfast is hugely important in Filipino culture, a legacy of the country\u2019s rich agricultural past, when farmworkers ate large morning meals to get through the day. Accordingly, the morning after Thanksgiving, the brothers Chad and Chase Valencia \u2014 who own the Filipino restaurant Lasa in Los Angeles's Chinatown \u2014 make breakfast sandwiches for their family out of leftover <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019757-asado\">asado</a> (a salty-sour pork dish), ham or turkey. The sandwiches are endlessly customizable: Chase mixes the asado and its accompanying sauce into the eggs, like a scramble, to become the base of the sandwich, while Chad crowns his with a fried egg. But the constants are the queso de bola, a nutty Filipino cheese (similar to Edam cheese) served during the holidays that melts elegantly atop the meat, and pan de sal, a slightly squishy, yeasted roll whose sweetness stands up to all the savory components of the sandwich. Both the cheese and the pan de sal are readily available at many Asian grocery stores, and well worth getting to make superior sandwiches.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/21valenciarex2/merlin_146709171_c222d9fe-4205-4f13-8e9f-326858df1f1f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, filipino", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, sandwiches", "keywords": "asado, pan de sal, queso de bola, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pan de sal or other soft rolls such as bolillos, dinner rolls or potato rolls", "Mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed", "1/2 to 3/4 pound leftover sliced asado (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019757-asado\">see recipe</a>), ham or turkey", "4 large eggs", "Kosher salt", "4 slices queso de bola (or Edam cheese)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large cast-iron pan over medium heat.
