{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Octopus Bolognese", "description": "This quick and rich nontraditional riff on bolognese features convenient yet under-used tender and meaty tinned octopus. Look for octopus that\u2019s packed in olive oil; the oil will add depth to the sauce, along with clam juice to heighten the seafood flavor. Tangy capers brighten the sauce, while nutty Parmesan rounds it out. (Cheese can typically overpower the delicate flavor of seafood, but octopus has a hearty texture and here, it is enhanced by a hit of nutty Parmesan cheese.) Serve it over pasta or polenta; it\u2019s also great with mashed potatoes or sopped up with crusty bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/29/dining/kc-octopus-bolognese/kc-octopus-bolognese-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, one pot, sauces and gravies, seafood, main course", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, caper, clam juice, dutch oven, octopus, parmesan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 86}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 small onion, cut into 1/4-inch pieces (1/2 cup)", "1 large carrot, cut into 1/4-inch pieces (1/2 cup)", "2 celery stalks, cut into 1/4-inch pieces (1/2 cup)", "Kosher salt and pepper", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes", "1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice", "2 basil sprigs, plus chopped basil for garnish", "2 (4-ounce) cans octopus packed in olive oil", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "Cooked pasta or polenta", "Red-pepper flakes (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium.
