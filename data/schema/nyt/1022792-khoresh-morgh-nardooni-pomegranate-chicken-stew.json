{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Khoresh Morgh Nardooni (Pomegranate Chicken Stew)", "description": "Khoresh morgh nardooni (also called anar mosama) is a deeply flavorful dish from the northern provinces of Iran. It is wonderful for Shab-e Yalda, the Iranian celebration of the winter solstice, or for any holiday celebration. Pomegranates on Yalda symbolize a red dawn: the emergence of light and brighter days ahead. Here, the combination of pomegranate molasses and pomegranate seeds showcase the various ways the fruit is used in Iranian cuisine. While not traditional, some preparations, such as this one, use tomato paste for added depth and vibrancy. Serve this with Persian rice, a side of fresh herbs, radishes and scallions.\u00a0\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/06/dining/06yaldarex2/merlin_198330927_09085d19-6e87-4d4e-901c-469852878001-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken legs, pomegranate molasses, pomegranate seeds, saffron, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 468}, "recipeIngredient": ["A pinch of saffron threads (about 3/4 teaspoon)", "A pinch of granulated sugar, plus more as needed", "4 bone-in, skin-on chicken legs (about 3 pounds)\u00a0", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large yellow onion, diced", "3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed\u00a0", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses (see Tip)\u00a0", "1 1/2 cups pomegranate seeds (from 1 large pomegranate)", "Lemon juice, as needed", "Mint leaves, for garnishing (optional)", "Steamed rice, fresh herbs, sliced radishes and scallion segments, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 2 tablespoons water to a boil in a small saucepan, kettle or using the microwave, then let stand for 2 minutes to allow the temperature to drop slightly while you grind the saffron.
