It couldn't be easier to make (saut\u00e9, blend and freeze) and it's gorgeous to boot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/05/business/08recipehealth/08recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One quart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dessert, fall, winter, gluten-free, healthy, vegan, vegetarian, pear, red wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 67, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds ripe pears (4 medium to large pears, like Bartlett pears)", "1/2 cup sugar, preferably organic fair-trade", "1 1/2 cups red wine", "1 1/2 cups water", "1 2- or 3-inch cinnamon stick", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel, core and quarter the pears.
