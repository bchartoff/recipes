{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gravlax", "description": "I\u2019ve always thought that gravlax should be translated as \u201cgift from the Norse gods\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s the perfect party dish. It\u2019s a fillet of salmon cured in a mixture of salt, sugar and herbs. After two to three days, the fish emerges silky, flavorful to its core and easy to slice. While gravlax is traditionally cured with dill, I like to make a bouquet of herbs, heavy on the dill but including mint and basil as well. And while a sweet mustard-dill sauce is the usual sauce to go with gravlax, I\u2019ve tinkered here too: my sauce is made with yogurt, a bit of mayo, white balsamic vinegar, lemon juice and yes, dill. It\u2019s a bit tangier than the norm and perfect with the rich salmon. Serve on thinly sliced rye bread or crackers, and if you\u2019ve got some pickled onions, add them to the platter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/26/dining/26cooking-gravlax/26cooking-gravlax-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P2DT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "project, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, dill, salmon fillet, white balsamic vinegar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 59}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 276, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "310 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 bunches fresh dill, rinsed and dried", "1 bunch mint, rinsed and dried", "1 bunch basil, rinsed and dried", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/3 cup kosher or coarse salt", "1 salmon fillet (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds), center cut, with skin, rinsed and patted dry", "1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt", "3 tablespoons mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "5 tablespoons minced dill fronds", "Fine sea salt, to taste", "Whole-grain crackers or thin-sliced dark bread", "Pickled onions, optional", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "To make the gravlax:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Two to three days ahead of time, mix the herbs together, and use half of them to cover the bottom of an 8- or 9-inch square nonreactive pan.
