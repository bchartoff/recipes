{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carne Adobada (Chile-Marinated Steak)", "description": "Mexican adobada, a tangy marinade with guajillo chiles, is often reserved for large cuts of pork, but it\u2019s also well-suited to any sturdy cut of steak, such as flank. The acid comes from lime juice in this formula, but vinegar or lemon juice works as well. An overnight marinade yields incredibly tender results, but a 30-minute steep is sufficient to infuse the meat with the fruity flavor of the chiles. Here, the steak is paired with a nice piquant roasted red pepper relish, which complements the deep flavors of the marinated meat. Side dishes like rice, beans and warm tortillas round this dish out for a wonderful weeknight meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/28/dining/carneadobadarex/merlin_186997698_0f436e7b-8736-4cd7-af80-187f483408f1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, steaks and chops, main course", "keywords": "flank steak, guajillo chiles, red pepper", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 693}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 dried guajillo chiles", "1 chipotle chile in adobo", "1/2 small yellow onion, peeled and chopped", "3 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "4 tablespoons lime juice, from 2 limes", "1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak", "Kosher salt", "2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1/2 cup drained and chopped roasted red peppers", "2 small shallots, minced", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "Steamed rice or warm tortillas, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the dried guajillo chiles in a small bowl and add enough hot water to cover; soak until softened, about 10 minutes.
