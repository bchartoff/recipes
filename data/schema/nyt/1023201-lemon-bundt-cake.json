{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon Bundt Cake", "description": "This is a big, bold lemony cake that uses the zest, juice and flesh of lemons for an extrapuckery bite. A thin layer of crackly lemon glaze coats the whole cake for a beautiful and delicious finish. Serve this cake as is, or add some berries and whipped cream to dress it up. It tastes even better the next day, so feel free to make it ahead. Since it makes use of the lemon skins, use organic or unwaxed lemons if you can.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/17/dining/ya-lemon-bundt-cake/ya-lemon-bundt-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bundt cake, lemon, sour cream, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 594}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan", "3 cups/384 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "4 lemons (preferably organic or unwaxed), scrubbed and dried", "2 1/4 cups/450 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters neutral oil", "5 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup/230 grams sour cream, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1/2 teaspoon fine salt, plus more for the glaze", "2 cups/200 grams sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12- to 15-cup Bundt pan.
