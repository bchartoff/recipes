{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Mushroom Base", "description": "At this year\u2019s Worlds of Health Flavors conference in Napa, Calif., Pam Smith, a culinary nutritionist, presented delicious recipes by the chef Clifford Pleau featuring a finely chopped roasted mushroom mix (chefs refer to it as simply \u201cThe Mix\u201d), that she combined with beef for a delicious burger with half the meat, and with tuna for a wonderful tuna burger. Inspired, I made up a big batch of my own version of the mushroom base when I got home and had a lot of fun using it all week in adaptations of classic meat or fish dishes with the animal protein cut by half or more and replaced with the mushroom base. I recommend using pre-sliced mushrooms for this \u2013 then the mix goes very quickly. It is very easy to make and keeps well for several days in the refrigerator.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/03/science/recipehealthmushrooms/recipehealthmushrooms-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "1 1/4 pounds or about 3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low-carb, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 195}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 111, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "545 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 pounds mushrooms, sliced or quartered", "Salt to taste", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
