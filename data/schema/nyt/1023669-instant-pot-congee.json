{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Instant Pot Congee", "description": "You can use any leftover roasted meat to flavor this mild, comforting congee, which is delicately seasoned with white pepper. Adapted from Liyan Chen of New Jersey, this recipe is a perfect use for all the bits and pieces of your leftover Thanksgiving turkey (or chicken or duck during the rest of the year). If you\u2019d like to, add the shredded lettuce just before serving so it retains some of its texture. Then garnish the top with any combination of scallions, ginger, soy sauce or chile sauce that pleases you. Note that congee will thicken as it cools, but you can thin it out again with a little water or stock.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/23/dining/22apperex3-congee/merlin_216459849_20ff6ed7-97a1-4fec-b45f-8f6d49481019-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "chicken, duck, instant pot, jasmine rice, porridge, thanksgiving leftover, turkey, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 176}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 cups diced roasted duck, chicken or turkey (preferably dark meat), with some of the skin", "1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed", "1 1/2 teaspoon fine salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper, plus more to taste", "2 cups chopped romaine (optional)", "Thinly sliced scallions, for garnish", "Thinly slivered ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil or chile crisp, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the pot of an electric pressure cooker, add roasted meat, rice, salt, pepper and 6 cups water.
