I like to add a little cr\u00e8me de cassis liqueur to the wine, along with honey, vanilla and cinnamon. The cassis, made from black currants,adds a deep berry essence to the syrupy wine. You can serve these pears warm or chilled. The poached pears will keep well for a couple of days in the refrigerator. The pears will continue to soften.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/19/dining/Pears-Poached-in-Red-Wine/Pears-Poached-in-Red-Wine-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, vegetarian, dessert, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 29}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 339, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "9 milligrams", "sugarContent": "40 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups not-too-robust red wine, such as a Beaujolais or a C\u00f4tes du Luberon", "1/3 cup mild honey, such as clover", "1/4 cup cr\u00e8me de cassis liqueur", "1 vanilla bean, cut in half lengthwise", "1 cinnamon stick", "1/2 cup dark or golden raisins", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "4 firm but ripe pears", "1/4 cup lightly toasted slivered almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine wine, honey, and cr\u00e8me de cassis in a medium saucepan.
