{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet and Salty Grilled Steak With Cucumber Salad", "description": "The marinade on this steak is inspired by a classic Vietnamese dipping sauce called nuoc cham. Since it consists mostly of pantry staples \u2013 Asian fish sauce, brown sugar and garlic \u2013 all you need to pick up on the way home are some fresh limes and jalape\u00f1o. Nuoc cham works as a salad dressing, too. Here we drizzle it on crisp cucumbers and radishes, but sliced ripe tomatoes work just as well. You could serve it as it is with the salad on the side, or put everything on top of a bed of rice noodles or rice for a more substantial meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/dining/dj-take/dj-take-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, steaks and chops, main course", "keywords": "cucumber, flank steak, radish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3042}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1959 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup fish sauce", "1 tablespoon packed lime zest", "1/3 cup fresh lime juice (from about 3 limes)", "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "2 garlic cloves, grated or minced", "1 large jalape\u00f1o, seeds and veins removed if desired, minced", "1 flank steak, about 1 1/2 pounds", "1 small seedless English cucumber, thinly sliced", "1 large bunch of radishes, thinly sliced", "4 scallions, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon vegetable, peanut or olive oil (optional)", "Cooked rice noodles or rice, for serving (optional)", "Sesame seeds or crushed roasted peanuts, for serving (optional)", "Fresh mint leaves or cilantro, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine the fish sauce, lime zest, lime juice, brown sugar, garlic and jalape\u00f1o.
