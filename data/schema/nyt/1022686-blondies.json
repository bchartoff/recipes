{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blondies", "description": "Blondies are made for those of us that love chocolate chip cookies, but don\u2019t have the time or energy to bake tray after tray of scooped sweets. They have all the goodness of a cookie, but they come together in one pot, are baked in one pan and are ready to eat in less than an hour, start to finish. This recipe is a great base for any blondie dream you may have. Use chips or chopped bar chocolate, try butterscotch or white chocolate chunks, stir in nuts, coconut or seeds. If you like your blondies sort of brownielike, follow the recipe as follows. For a chewier, cookielike blondie, reduce the eggs by one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/27/dining/ss-blondies/ss-blondies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "16 bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "blondie, butter, chocolate, flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 529}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons/170 grams butter, salted or unsalted, plus more for greasing", "1 cup/220 grams packed brown sugar, light or dark", "2 large eggs", "1 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups/255 grams bittersweet chocolate chunks or chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
