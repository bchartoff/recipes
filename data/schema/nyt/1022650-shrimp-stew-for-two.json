{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp Stew for Two", "description": "A stew should be as comforting to cook as it is to eat. In this effortless one-pot meal, a spicy, aromatic broth is tinged red with gochugaru, a Korean red-pepper powder. You want to use jumbo shrimp or prawns for this; be sure to get shell-on crustaceans (and head-on if you can), as they\u2019re essential to flavoring this simple dish with their incredible nuttiness. Bitter greens and sweet radishes add vegetal heft as well as complexity to the broth, which you should definitely sop up with bread or rice. If seafood dishes like bouillabaisse, cioppino and maeuntang excite you, then this brothy wonder will delight and nourish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/17/magazine/17mag-eat-web/17mag-eat-web-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "broccoli rabe, radish, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 681}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 large shallots, thinly sliced crosswise", "Salt and black pepper", "4 large garlic cloves, finely grated", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 tablespoons gochugaru, plus more to taste (see Tip)", "8 ounces broccoli rabe, Tuscan kale or other sturdy bitter greens, coarsely chopped", "8 to 10 shell-on jumbo shrimp or 4 tiger prawns, preferably head-on, deveined (about 8 ounces)", "6 ounces radishes, thinly sliced (1 \u00bd cups)", "1 tablespoon fish sauce, plus more to taste", "Pinch of granulated sugar, plus more to taste", "Toasted crusty bread or steamed white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high.
