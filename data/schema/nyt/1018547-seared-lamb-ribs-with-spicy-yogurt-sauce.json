{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Lamb Ribs With Spicy Yogurt Sauce", "description": "These crisp-edged lamb ribs, from the chef Ignacio Mattos, are a fine match for a spicy Corsican red wine. If you are unable to special-order lamb ribs from your butcher, you can trim your own. Buy a rack of lamb, neither Frenched nor baby, and remove the meaty eye section, saving it for another use. You will be left with the ribs. This recipe takes time, but can be made up to two days in advance. Give the ribs their final sear just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/25/dining/25PairingSub/25PairingSub-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, Dijon mustard, lamb ribs, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons sea salt", "2 cloves garlic, slivered", "3 pounds lamb ribs, in one piece (about 8 ribs), trimmed", "4 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon crushed black peppercorns", "1 tablespoon crushed dry green peppercorns", "1/2 cup Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 jalape\u00f1o chile, seeded and minced", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground", "Sea salt, to taste", "1 lemon, in wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brine the ribs: Dissolve salt in 5 cups cool water.
