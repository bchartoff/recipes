{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Feta-Brined Roast Chicken", "description": "Brining a chicken before roasting can make for a particularly juicy, tender bird. Using feta in the brine adds a complex and earthy flavor to the mix. Don\u2019t skip the step of taking the chicken out of the brine an hour before cooking. This allows the bird to come to room temperature and dries it out a bit, which helps crisp the skin. This recipe calls for a lot of black pepper, and if you like a spicy bite, don\u2019t afraid to go for the full 2 tablespoons. Or bring the amount down for something milder. In either case, do grind it yourself; the pre-ground stuff is missing all the essential oils that give freshly ground black pepper its woodsy, floral notes. Roasted potatoes make an excellent side dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/20/dining/feta-chicken/feta-chicken-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, roasts", "keywords": "chicken, feta cheese, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 682}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 841, "unsaturatedFatContent": "40 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "63 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "59 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "1184 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled", "3 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 3 1/2- to 4-pound whole chicken", "1 to 2 tablespoons cracked black pepper, to taste", "2 tablespoons dried Greek oregano", "2 large lemons", "1/4 cup olive oil, more as needed", "1 large bunch arugula or other sturdy salad greens, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before serving, combine 2 ounces feta, 2 teaspoons salt and 4 cups water in a blender and blend until smooth.
