{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Salmon With Miso Rice and Ginger-Scallion Vinaigrette", "description": "This simple weeknight meal makes great use of pantry staples to create complex flavors with minimal work. Miso is often used to flavor soups or sauces, and here, it is added to raw rice before cooking, which results in a delightfully sticky, savory steamed rice. Fragrant and nutty basmati is called for, but any long-grain rice will work. Shredded cabbage brings freshness and crunch to the finished dish, but use whatever crispy vegetable you have on hand: shredded brussels sprouts, carrots, snap peas, radishes and iceberg lettuce are all great options. For a heftier meal, add some canned chickpeas, white beans or black beans. To finish, the vibrant tang of the bright ginger-scallion vinaigrette balances the richness of the roasted salmon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/04/dining/kc-miso-salmon/merlin_172953306_4a33a2fc-08f5-4122-84a4-2819c47dd482-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, grains and rice, seafood, main course", "keywords": "basmati rice, cabbage, ginger, miso, salmon, scallion, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3675}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup white or sweet miso", "1 1/2 cups basmati or other long-grain rice", "4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/4 cup chopped scallions, plus more for garnish", "1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "4 cups finely shredded cabbage, such as green, Napa or savoy (about 8 ounces)", "Roasted sesame oil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.\u00a0In a medium saucepan, whisk miso with 2 1/4 cups water until dissolved.
