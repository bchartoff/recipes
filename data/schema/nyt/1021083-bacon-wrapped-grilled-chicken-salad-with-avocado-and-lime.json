{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bacon-Wrapped Grilled Chicken Salad With Avocado and Lime", "description": "Wrap your chicken with bacon, grill it and drizzle it with this nearly green goddess, almost-guacamole dressing and you might even convert burger eaters into salad fiends. Covering the\u00a0butterflied breasts in bacon helps baste the lean chicken and accelerates char as fat melts onto the coals. Flare-ups are inevitable, but don\u2019t be alarmed: They will ensure rich color on the bacon while protecting the breast from overcooking. When assembling the salad, avoid weighing down the leaves with hot and heavy toppings: Dollop plenty of the dressing on the plate first, and layer most of the chicken and fudgy eggs below the lightly dressed leaves. There should be a little leftover dressing to satisfy the people that will want to dip each bite of chicken into the herby, lime-laced avocado.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clare de Boer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/dining/18chickenrex3/merlin_172407795_1114dced-7293-48fb-b046-bc839122771b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry, salads and dressings, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "avocado, bacon, chicken breast, herbs, lime, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 536}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 10 ounces each)", "1 1/2 teaspoons flaky sea salt", "1/8 teaspoon black pepper", "16 slices bacon", "1/2 cup any and all soft herbs, such as tarragon, dill, parsley or cilantro, plus more for garnish", "2 teaspoons sea salt", "1 garlic clove", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 limes)", "3 ripe avocados", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/8 teaspoon black pepper", "2 jalape\u00f1os, thinly sliced into rounds", "2 1/2 pounds any mixture of crunchy salad leaves: endive, watercress, radicchio, romaine or Little Gems (about 4 quarts)", "Olive oil, as needed", "Kosher salt", "4 fudgy <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020468-perfect-boiled-eggs\">soft-boiled eggs</a>, peeled and halved", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Take the chicken breasts out of the fridge to come to room temperature.
