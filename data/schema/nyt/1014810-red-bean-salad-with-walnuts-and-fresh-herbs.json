{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red Bean Salad With Walnuts and Fresh Herbs", "description": "This is inspired by a number of red bean recipes from Georgia (the country, not the state). Walnuts, herbs, garlic and pomegranate juice show up in many Georgian dishes. I used pomegranate molasses, which is more of a Middle Eastern ingredient, in the dressing, and I love the sweet and sour tang it introduces to the dish. I prefer using small red beans that I\u2019ve cooked myself, but in a pinch you can make this with canned red kidney beans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/18/science/19recipehealth/19recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, herbs, red beans, walnut, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 48}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 460, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "24 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "313 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups cooked red beans or kidney beans (rinse if using canned)", "1/4 cup finely diced celery", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon", "1/4 cup chopped chives", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1/2 small red onion, cut in half lengthwise, then cut across the grain in thin slices (optional)", "1/3 cup (1 1/2 ounces) walnuts", "1 large garlic clove, peeled, halved, green shoot removed", "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes or 1/2 to 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper, to taste", "1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon walnut (or olive) oil", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the beans in a bowl and toss with the celery and herbs.
