In fact, think of it as a chili alternative, just as thick and spicy. The dumplings are easy, and cook in the soup, but they\u2019re entirely optional. Other versions of this soup may call for salted pig tails, but here, they\u2019re swapped out for smoked turkey necks. Either one adds a deep smokiness. Cock-flavored soup mix, such as one from Grace, gives this soup yet another layer of flavor; you can find it in the international aisle of most supermarkets.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/01/dining/mp-red-peas-soup/merlin_184703058_64214392-74a2-44bf-be1b-3dc256d13e2b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 generous servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "coconut milk, red beans, scotch bonnet, sweet potato, turkey necks", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 148}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups dried red kidney beans", "1 pound smoked turkey necks", "8 cups water or low-sodium chicken stock", "1 (13.5-ounce) can coconut milk", "1 (1.75-ounce) package cock-flavored soup mix, such as Grace", "4 garlic cloves, chopped", "4 scallions, halved crosswise", "4 thyme sprigs", "1 medium onion, diced", "1 Scotch bonnet pepper, pierced (not sliced)", "1 standard chicken bouillon cube", "1 teaspoon ground allspice", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 medium sweet potato or yam, diced", "1 carrot, diced", "Cooked white rice, for serving (optional)", "2 cups self-rising flour", "1 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cover the dried beans with 4 to 6 cups water in a large bowl, and soak them overnight."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To a large, heavy pot, add smoked turkey and enough water or stock to cover the meat (about 8 cups).
