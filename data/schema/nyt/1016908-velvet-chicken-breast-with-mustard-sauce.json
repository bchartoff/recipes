{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Velvet Chicken Breast With Mustard Sauce", "description": "Cooking chicken breasts can be tricky, especially the \u201cskinless-boneless\u201d kind. No matter if they are pan-fried or grilled, they are apt to be dry if left to cook even a minute too long. This recipe borrows a Chinese technique called velveting that guarantees a moist chicken breast. A simple marinade made with egg white and cornstarch is the solution. Usually the chicken is cut into strips or cubes, but small chicken breasts or cutlets can be prepared the same way for Western-style dishes. Here, an assertive mustard sauce pairs nicely with the tender meat. Serve with boiled potatoes and crisp watercress, or stir-fried spinach.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/29/dining/29KITCHEN/29KITCHEN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "chicken breast, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, mustard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 939}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 425, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "732 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 small skinless-boneless chicken breasts, about 6 ounces each", "Salt and pepper", "2 egg whites (about 4 tablespoons)", "4 tablespoons cornstarch", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons whole-grain Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon dried mustard", "1 tablespoon grated horseradish", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 cup chicken broth", "3 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil", "1 teaspoon roughly chopped thyme leaves", "2 tablespoons snipped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim chicken breasts to a uniform size, shape and thickness; they should be about 1/2 inch thick.
