In African American communities, the tradition of eating rice and cowpeas dates to a celebration on Dec. 31, 1862, Freedom\u2019s Eve. On that day, enslaved Africans congregated in churches in the south, eager to hear the news that the Emancipation Proclamation had set them free. The tradition of eating peas and rice for the new year is now deeply held across cultures throughout the United States and ties to centuries-old folklore that might just lead to better health, prosperity and maybe, just maybe, a bit more luck.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kayla Stewart"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/29/dining/7NEW-YEARSREX2/merlin_199406973_339c4818-0fd3-4761-bae4-496cf905b4ad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, main course, side dish", "keywords": "black-eyed peas, ham hock, rice, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1077}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried black-eyed peas, picked over for stones, rinsed, soaked in water overnight, and drained", "3/4 pound salt pork or bacon, cut into 1/4-inch dice", "1 small onion, chopped", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "6 cups chicken stock, store-bought or homemade", "1/2 cup diced (1/4-inch) ham (2 1/2 ounces)", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Fine salt and black pepper", "1 cup long-grain rice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the black-eyed peas in cold water overnight, then drain when ready to cook."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large saucepan, cook the salt pork over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp and the fat is rendered, about 6 minutes.
