The cake\u2019s dark chocolate flavor is enhanced by Dutch-processed cocoa powder, which produces a much deeper, Oreo-like chocolaty taste than natural unsweetened cocoa powder. A glossy, cherry-red layer of preserves keeps the crumb moist and tender, and a splash of almond extract evokes the aromatic bittersweetness of kirsch or maraschino cherries (cherries are, after all, in the same family as almonds). Don\u2019t forget the actual cherries on top; they\u2019ll make you happy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/24/dining/24EAT-chocoate-cherry-cake/merlin_210300225_6e5c9125-dd71-482a-8486-41795efbca2b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "cherries, cherry preserves, dutch-processed cocoa powder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 350}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/118 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing pan", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/56 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "2 large eggs", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters whole milk", "1 teaspoon pure almond extract", "1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt or 3/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt", "1 cup/305 grams cherry preserves (see Tip)", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/28 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1/4 cup boiling hot water", "2 cups/473 milliliters cold heavy whipping cream", "Fresh red cherries, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
