(It'd be especially great for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year, or for novice or time-pressed Thanksgiving bakers.) The cake's texture and appeal are similar to those of banana bread; if you like, you can stir a large handful or two of raisins, nuts or both into the batter just before you scrape it into the pan. And although you can use homemade applesauce for this, know that store-bought is just fine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Turshen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/15/dining/Applesauce-Cake-Horizontal/merlin_146803209_5b62c27d-7727-4bbf-b2b4-7de71c0caf63-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "\u00a08 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, cakes", "keywords": "applesauce, cream cheese, honey, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 362}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 326, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "335 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "1\u00a0tablespoon\u00a0ground ginger", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "2 eggs, beaten", "1/2 cup/100 grams sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters buttermilk or plain yogurt", "1 1/2 cups/400 grams unsweetened applesauce", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters canola or other neutral oil", "6 ounces/170 grams cream cheese,\u00a0at room temperature", "2\u00a0tablespoons\u00a0sour cream", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters honey", "Pinch of kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
