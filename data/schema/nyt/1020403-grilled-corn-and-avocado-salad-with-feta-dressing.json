The sweetness of peak-summer corn and the richness of creamy avocado balance out the tartness of the dressing. To choose the perfect corn, make sure that the corn husk is bright green and slightly dewy to the touch, and that the silks peeking out at the top are yellow, not browned. Finally, the corn should be heavy for its size: the heavier the corn, the plumper the kernels.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/14/dining/sl-corn-and-avocado-salad/merlin_159056649_e9aed760-37ec-4a54-bdfa-6d0f3f4459af-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "avocado, buttermilk, corn, feta, jalape\u00f1o, romaine, scallion, main course, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 411}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ears corn (about 3 pounds), shucked and silk removed", "1 bunch scallions (about 6), trimmed", "1 jalape\u00f1o, stemmed and halved lengthwise", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (about 3/4 cup)", "1/3 cup buttermilk", "1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 small garlic clove, grated", "1/4 cup sliced fresh chives", "1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley", "1 medium head romaine lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces (about 8 cups)", "2 avocados, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high.
