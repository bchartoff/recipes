{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mulligatawny Soup", "description": "This soup is a British-Indian cuisine hybrid, the result of colonizers\u2019 encounters with rasam \u2014 a spiced, soupy dish often enriched with lentils, sometimes served over rice \u2014 from Tamil Nadu, a region in southern India. \u201cMilagu tannir,\u201d which means pepper water, was how Tamil people described some versions of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/magazine/soup-so-vibrant-its-called-the-elixir-of-life.html\">rasam</a>; it morphed into mulligatawny when the British made it thick, chunky and meaty. In the cookbook \u201cClassic Indian Cooking,\u201d the author Julie Sahni wrote that she fell in love with mulligatawny when she first encountered it in Germany. \u201cThe present version bears no resemblance whatever to the traditional rasam,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cBecause of its unorthodox origin, Indian cooks have had a field day exercising their creative genius with it.\u201d This version is thickened with a roux, masoor dal and coconut milk, and bolstered with chicken thighs and tart apple. Curry powder is not a traditional Indian ingredient, but it reflects the dish\u2019s British influence.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/03/dining/sd-mulligatawny-soup/merlin_200566023_92fc6f7d-9613-44cf-a953-47e0c56ad173-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "british, indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course", "keywords": "apple, chicken thigh, coconut milk, red lentils, soup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1139}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1 red or yellow onion, minced\u00a0", "Salt\u00a0", "8 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "2 tablespoons minced ginger (from about 2 inches of peeled ginger root)", "2 teaspoons black or brown mustard seeds", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "2 carrots, peeled and sliced", "2 celery stalks, sliced", "1 large apple, preferably Granny Smith, peeled, cored and chopped", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized chunks", "1 cup masoor dal (split red lentils)", "6 cups chicken broth or stock", "1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk\u00a0", "Juice of 1 lime (about 1\u00bd tablespoons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Warm the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
