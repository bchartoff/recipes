{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dick Taeuber's Brandy Alexander Pie", "description": "In January 1970, The Times published a recipe for brandy Alexander pie. It was an unassuming confection: a graham-cracker crust filled with a wobbly, creamy mousse and enough alcohol to raise the hair on your neck and then make your neck wobbly too. Later that year, Craig Claiborne, then the food editor, declared it one of the paper\u2019s three most-requested dessert recipes and ran it again. By rights, this should have been the recipe\u2019s swan song.\n \nBut thanks to Dick Taeuber, a Maryland statistician, the pie lived on. Taeuber discovered that you could use a simple formula to make the pie in the flavor of almost any cocktail you wanted (3 eggs to 1 cup cream to 1/2 cup liquor). In 1975, Claiborne renamed it Dick Taeuber\u2019s cordial pie and published it once more, this time with all 20 variations (see note). \n\nCalling it a cordial pie doesn\u2019t quite capture its punch or proof. Booze pie would be more fitting. It\u2019s not the kind of thing you want to serve for a children\u2019s birthday party.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/29/dining/Brandy-Alexander-Pie/Brandy-Alexander-Pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "cognac, graham cracker crumbs, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 77}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 495, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "323 milligrams", "sugarContent": "32 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups graham-cracker crumbs", "1/3 cup melted butter", "1 envelope unflavored gelatin", "2/3 cup sugar", "teaspoon salt", "3 eggs, separated", "1/4 cup Cognac", "1/4 cup creme de cacao", "1 cup heavy cream", "Food coloring (optional)", "Chocolate curls, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
