{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Roasted Beef", "description": "With the aid of a digital thermometer and plenty of hands-off time, this recipe makes the best of an inexpensive beef roast, which really shines when thinly sliced and reused in flavor-packed dishes over the next week. Though the recipe suggests a 2- to 3-pound roast, it will work for one of any size. (Just be aware that the timing will change accordingly.) As the beef rests in the fridge, it will initially darken in color and may later turn brown or gray; this is due to the oxidation of muscle pigments and is expected. Once you start cooking, always rely on your thermometer, not your timer. To test for doneness without a thermometer, insert a thin metal skewer all the way through the meat and hold it there for 10 seconds. Rapidly remove the skewer and touch it to the skin under your lower lip. It will feel like a hot bath water at rare.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
