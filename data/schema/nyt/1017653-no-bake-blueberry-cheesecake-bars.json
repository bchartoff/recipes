Other flavor possibilities to add with the blueberries: any citrus you like; a teaspoon or so of very finely ground coffee or cocoa; or chopped raisins or, I suppose, chocolate chips. I prefer the straight honey-lemon combination, unadulterated.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/19/dining/no-bake-blueberry-cheesecake-bars/no-bake-blueberry-cheesecake-bars-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "blueberry, cream cheese, graham cracker, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 369}, "recipeIngredient": ["16 graham cracker squares (8 whole crackers), crushed", "1/4 cup ground pecans or walnuts, optional", "3 tablespoons melted butter", "1 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature", "1 cup ricotta cheese", "2 tablespoons honey, or to taste", "Rind of a lemon, freshly grated", "Pinch salt", "About 1 1/2 cups blueberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine crushed graham crackers, nuts if using, and melted butter.
