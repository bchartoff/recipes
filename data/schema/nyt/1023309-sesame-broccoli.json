{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame Broccoli", "description": "Mild broccoli gets energized by this textured, rich dressing spiked with sweet miso and soy sauce. Crushed toasted sesame seeds create the intense flavor base for this rich, super nutty sauce. The dish is a great side to accompany any grilled or roasted protein; it can be made a few hours in advance and is equally tasty chilled or at room temperature. Any leftovers can be chopped and tossed with warm pasta and grated Parmesan the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/18/dining/kc-sesame-broccoli/merlin_210911811_7eabd027-f294-42c5-8fd8-b2634b83ed46-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "broccoli florets, miso", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 383}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "Ice, as needed", "1/3 cup toasted white sesame seeds", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1 tablespoon white miso", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar", "1 1/2 pounds broccoli florets (1 1/2- to 2-inch pieces, about 10 cups)", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and prepare an ice bath."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "While the water comes to a boil, in a small nonstick skillet over low heat, refresh the toasted sesame seeds, stirring frequently, until oils are released and seeds are warmed through, about 3 minutes.
