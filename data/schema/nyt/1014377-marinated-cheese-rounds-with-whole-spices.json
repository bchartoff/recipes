The fresh cheese can be chalky, but in this recipe, the rounds are softened in olive oil for a week, giving them a lush, spreadable texture. Cheese and oil both absorb the taste of bay leaf, black pepper, rosemary and lemon, and the pink peppercorns add crunch, perfume and festive color.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/12/05/dining/05JULIA1_SPAN/05JULIA1_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Two or three jars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "appetizer, extra virgin olive oil, goat cheese, spices, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["6 small goat cheeses, 2 to 3 ounces each, or 1 log goat cheese, 10 to 12 ounces, cut into 6 pieces", "2 teaspoons coriander seeds", "2 teaspoons pink peppercorns", "2 teaspoons black peppercorns", "1 large sprig rosemary, cut into 6 pieces, or 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary", "2 or 3 bay leaves", "2 or 3 strips lemon peel", "2 to 3 cups extra-virgin olive oil", "2 or 3 wide-mouth 1-pint or 1/2-liter jars"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Divide the cheeses between the jars.
