These are lofty words for a simple process, which boils down to making a plum pur\u00e9e and a honey-thyme syrup, mixing them together and freezing the whole thing. The pinch of ascorbic acid, or vitamin-C powder, is there to prevent browning of the fruit. As always when it comes to sorbets, use the best fruit you can find.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Hayes"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/23/dining/Black-Plum-Sorbet/Black-Plum-Sorbet-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "dessert, fall, honey, plum, thyme", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 49, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "29 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup, plus 1 tablespoon, granulated sugar", "4 sprigs of fresh thyme", "1 1/2 pounds very ripe black plums (approximately 6 plums)", "Pinch of ascorbic acid (vitamin-C powder, or simply pulverize a vitamin-C tablet using a mallet)", "Pinch of salt", "2 tablespoons honey"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dissolve the sugar in 1/2 cup water over medium heat.
