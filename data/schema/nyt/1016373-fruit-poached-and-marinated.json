{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fruit, Poached and Marinated", "description": "Fruit compotes make great compromise desserts; they\u2019re sweet, but not as sweet as sorbets, and like sorbets they don\u2019t require flour, butter or pastry skills. I didn\u2019t develop any kind of knack for pastry until I began collaborating with pastry chefs on their cookbooks, but for years I managed to round out my dinner parties with fruit-based desserts(though the children of my friend Clifford Wright used to roll their eyes when I brought dessert \u2013 \u201cShe doesn\u2019t bring dessert, she brings fruit,\u201d they\u2019d say). \nI revisited some of those desserts this week, particularly various fruits poached in wine, and I still find them delightful. I find that I\u2019m sometimes negligent about eating fruit in the colder months, but not when I have some wine-poached pears, bananas or prunes in the refrigerator. I am as likely to stir the fruit, with its luscious syrup, into my morning yogurt as to eat it for dessert, andthe compotes are good keepers.\nEarly spring is an in-between time for fruit. Stone fruits aren\u2019t ready yet and it\u2019s not really apple, pear or citrus season either, though all of those fall-winter fruits are still available. I poached pears in red wine and bananas in white wine, and used dried fruits for two of my compotes, prunes poached in red wine and a dried-fruit compote to which I also added a fresh apple and pear. For the last compote of the week I combined blood oranges and pink grapefruit in arefreshing citrus-caramel syrup, and topped the fruit with pomegranate seeds. Even if my friend\u2019s kids wouldn\u2019t agree, this was definitely dessert.\nBananas Poached in Vanilla-Scented Chardonnay\nSummary:Don\u2019t overcook the bananas in this easy dish, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a fragrant, delicious dessert.\n\nI am usually not one forbananas in desserts, but this, if you\u2019re careful not to overcook the bananas, is heavenly. Years ago, in the early days of my career as a vegetarian caterer, I made it often; it was one of my most requested desserts. These days I\u2019m as likely to spoon some of the bananas with their fragrant syrup into a bowl of morning yogurt as I am to serve it after a meal.\n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, vegetarian, dessert, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 196, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "5 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups chardonnay", "1 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise", "1/3 cup mild honey, such as clover", "1 cinnamon stick", "1/2 cup golden raisins or currants", "1/2 cup dried apples (optional)", "Juice of 1 lemon", "3 to 4 firm but ripe bananas", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 cup lightly toasted slivered almonds", " Plain yogurt or whipped cream for topping, if desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour chardonnay into a medium saucepan.
