{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Stew With Pears and Sweet Potatoes", "description": "It's nice knowing that pears, which we think of almost exclusively for desserts in this country, are often used in savory ways in Eastern European cuisines. In this stew, caraway seeds, allspice and fennel reinforce that heritage, while sweet potatoes add rich, round flavors. Although bone-in ribs seem a bit more flavorful, boneless are also fine here. You can even use a combination of both if that\u2019s what turns out to be in the package you buy at the store. Because the pears can turn mushy overnight, this is the rare stew that\u2019s actually best served the day that it\u2019s made.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/dining/03COUNTRYRIBS/merlin_130347377_95e7cbf1-ec80-4671-8eb4-7d9a11c418d9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "fennel, pear, pork rib, sweet potato, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 567}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 876, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "43 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "63 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1428 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds boneless or 3 pounds bone-in country-style pork ribs", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more as needed", "2 onions, halved and thinly sliced", "2 bulbs fennel, fronds removed, bulb cored and thinly sliced", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "2 large or 3 small sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons caraway seeds", "1 teaspoon ground allspice", "2 bay leaves", "2 to 3 cups chicken stock", "3 pears of your choice, peeled, cored and cut into 1-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Grainy mustard for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using bone-in ribs, cut away the bones and set aside.
