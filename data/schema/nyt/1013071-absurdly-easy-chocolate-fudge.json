Mr. Chu\u2019s chocolate fudge recipe, of which this is an adaptation, has the pleasantly cakey, almost sandy texture desirable in fudge, which can be tricky to achieve using milk and butter. He uses condensed milk to reduce the ingredients in the fudge to a mere three (salt is optional), and to eliminate the dreaded step of cooking the sugar syrup to the soft-ball stage. \u201cThe manufacturing process has already done that work for you,\u201d he said.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/27/dining/ElCerrito_Fudge2/ElCerrito_Fudge2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "16 two-inch squares", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "chocolate, sweetened condensed milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 581}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 241, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "35 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, plus extra for greasing the pan", "1 pound semisweet or bittersweet chocolate", "1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "1/8 teaspoon salt (optional)", "1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butter an 8-inch-square baking pan.
