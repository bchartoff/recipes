{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Brown Butter Rice Krispies Treats", "description": "This absurdly easy recipe came to The Times from Colin Alevras, then the chef at the Tasting Room in New York, which, until it closed in 2008, offered Rice Krispies treats every day, and made more for Halloween. Browning the butter elevates these plebeian snacks into something more toothsome, and it adds just an extra couple of minutes to the process. They\u2019re so good. (The original recipe called for one bag of marshmallows, but after retesting, we've updated it to call for two bags. This should yield a chewier, gooier treat.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/29/dining/29COOKING-CRMLZDKRISPIETREAT1/29COOKING-CRMLZDKRISPIETREAT1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "30 to 50 treats", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "dessert, gluten-free, marshmallow, rice krispies", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 778}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 120, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "57 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces butter, salted or unsalted, preferably cultured, plus extra for pan", "2 10 1/2-ounce bag marshmallows (see note)", "1 12-ounce box Rice Krispies cereal"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper or wax paper, or butter it well."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, melt butter over medium-low heat.
