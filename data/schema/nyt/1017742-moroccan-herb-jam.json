{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Moroccan Herb Jam", "description": "Paula Wolfert's first and still-influential book, \"Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco,\" published in 1973, influenced a generation of cooks yearning to expand its horizons.  This fascinating recipe for a mixture of long-cooked greens, which she learned while living in Morocco, appeared in her 2003 book, \"The Slow Mediterranean Kitchen: Recipes for the Passionate Cook\". The acclaimed chef Russell Moore of Camino restaurant in Oakland, Calif., a\u00a0 great fan of Ms. Wolfert and this recipe, has now adapted it and incorporated herb jam into his menu on a daily basis. Among its virtues: It tastes wonderful and lasts for a week or more in the refrigerator; it is great\u00a0when spread on toasted bread or stirred into a soup; and it uses greens, like the outer leaves of lettuce, that would otherwise be wasted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/dining/14KITCH2_WEB/14KITCH2_WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 50}, "recipeIngredient": ["1\u00bd \u00a0pounds various greens and herbs (like chard, kale, broccoli rabe, dill, marjoram, parsley, cilantro, celery tops and scallions, and outer leaves of lettuce or similar greens)", "6 large cloves garlic, unpeeled", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 small hot red chiles (dried) or a pinch of crushed red pepper", "Salt", "1\u00bd tablespoons cumin seeds, toasted in a dry pan until fragrant, then ground", "1/4 cup roughly chopped pitted black olives, such as Kalamata, or oil-cured", "Pinch of piment\u00f3n (Spanish smoked paprika)", "Lemon, for final seasoning", "Pita or flatbread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the greens and herbs and garlic cloves all together in a large steamer set over medium-high heat, and steam until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

The flavor is concentrated by cooking most of the moisture out of the greens; this will take about 10 to 15 minutes.

Peel the steamed garlic and mash it into the pan along with the olives. Mix everything and taste; add salt as needed, a good splash of olive oil, the piment\u00f3n and more cumin to taste. The herb jam should be highly seasoned. Add more chile if it isn\u2019t spicy enough. Just before serving, add a squeeze of lemon. Spread on toasted pita or flatbread if desired. The herb jam can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for about 5 days."}]}
