Rubbing lemon zest into the sugar releases a deep citrusy aroma, and a bit of cream of tartar gives them a snickerdoodle-like texture. This tender cookie has a sunny interior and is coated with crisp poppy seeds. Be sure to shop for poppy seeds where you know there is high turnover, such as from the bulk department in a health food store or a spice shop. They can sit on the shelves for a long time \u2014 and can go rancid quickly due to their high fat and protein content.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Laurie Ellen Pellicano"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/04/dining/lep-lemon-poppyseed-cookies/merlin_183223986_3e0ba2f4-3aeb-455f-bce4-0935a29709f1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "3 dozen (3-inch) cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "butter, flour, lemon, poppy seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 309}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/320 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons cream of tartar", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 lemons, for zesting", "1 cup/228 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 whole large egg plus 1 egg yolk", "1 tablespoon limoncello (or 1 \u00bd teaspoons lemon juice plus 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract)", "1/4 to 1/3 cup/40 to 60 grams poppy seeds, for coating"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cream of tartar and baking soda.
