Devein and season lightly with salt and pepper. In a deep saut\u00e9 pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium high heat. When it simmers, place the langoustines on their sides so that they curl up in the pan. As soon as one side is caramelized, about 1/2 minute, gently turn; add butter and bay leaf. Baste continuously for 2 minutes. They should still be a little translucent at the center. Remove from the pan and drain. Sprinkle with olive oil. (Craft uses lemon olive oil; you can sprinkle a little lemon juice if you can't find this.) Serve."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7273-langoustines"}
