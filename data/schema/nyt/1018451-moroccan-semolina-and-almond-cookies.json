{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Moroccan Semolina and Almond Cookies", "description": "Semolina flour gives these rather plain-looking but delicious cookies, adapted from \"Dorie's Cookies\" by Dorie Greenspan, a delightfully sandy texture. Almond flour makes them moist and rich, adding a gentle flavor and scent. If you don\u2019t have almond flour, make your own by pulsing blanched almond slices in a food processor until they're finely ground. Just don\u2019t over-process, or you\u2019ll wind up with almond butter. And if you\u2019re not a fan of orange blossom water, you can leave it out, or substitute rose water.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/07/dining/07JPCOOKBOOKS9/07JPCOOKBOOKS9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 3 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "almond flour, orange blossom water, semolina flour, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 185}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 127, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "36 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/294 grams semolina flour", "2 cups/200 grams almond flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 lemon", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters flavorless oil, such as canola", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon orange blossom water (optional)", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dredging"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position racks to divide the oven into thirds, and heat it to 350 degrees.
