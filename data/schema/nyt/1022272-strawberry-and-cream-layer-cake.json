{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry and Cream Layer Cake", "description": "This delicate cake is inspired by fraisier, a French cake made from layers of sponge, strawberries and cream. Fraisier cakes are elaborately constructed and typically combine several components to make the cream filling, but this strawberry cake is lighter, looser and much more casual. To avoid squishing the cake when slicing, use a serrated knife in long, even strokes to cut clean slices.
