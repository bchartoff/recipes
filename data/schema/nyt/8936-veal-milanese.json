I squeezed lemon over the veal and set about carving. It was just what I was after: the tender meat was pounded paper-thin with fat on the edges and a thin, pebbly coating of bread crumbs. The peppery salad and lemon offered steady relief. But it left me with a single thought: to come back in the summer when arugula and tomatoes are in season.\u201d Then she gave us a recipe for the dish, perfect for summer, when arugula and tomatoes are in season.
