{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut-Lime Shrimp", "description": "You can make this gingery, lightly sweet shrimp stew as tangy and spicy as you like by adjusting the amounts of chile and lime juice. Using full-fat coconut milk gives you the richest and most flavorful dish. But light coconut milk will also work, resulting in something brothier and more souplike.
