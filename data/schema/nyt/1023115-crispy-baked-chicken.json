{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Baked Chicken", "description": "For pull-apart tender chicken with crisp, deeply spiced skin, rub it with a spicy-sweet mix and roast it low and slow while you\u2019re doing something else. Because this chicken is cooked at a moderately low temperature, the spices will bloom but not burn, and the chicken fat will render slowly and completely (which means you don\u2019t need any oil). The smoky rub in this recipe will turn the chicken skin into what tastes like a barbecue potato chip, but you can use other spice blends, too, like </span><a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021923-garam-masala\"><span>garam masala</span></a><span> or Montreal steak seasoning. Just be sure your mix includes sugar for browning and salt for accentuating flavors. Whole chicken legs (with the thigh and drumstick attached) provide a more generous portion of juicy meat and skin that shatters, but a mix of drumsticks and bone-in thighs work, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/08/dining/as-baked-chicken/as-baked-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, chicken legs, paprika", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 986}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 teaspoons dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "A heaping 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne\u00a0", "4 chicken leg quarters (about 2 \u00bd to 3 pounds), patted dry"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
