{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Colombian Beef and Potato Empanadas", "description": "Colombian empanadas are typically quite small \u2014 a couple of bites each \u2014 and have a crisp corn crust. There are a wide range of fillings you\u2019ll find across Colombia, but this meat-and-potato mixture is the most common. Small yellow potatoes called papas criollas are the potato of choice here, but they are nearly impossible to find in the United States, so I use Yukon Gold instead. My wife\u2019s family typically keeps the seasonings simple \u2014 salt, pepper and a dash of paprika \u2014 though many recipes include cumin or Triguisar, a powdered seasoning mix that contains ground cumin, paprika, achiote, turmeric and garlic. I season my filling with a little chicken bouillon, but you could use plain salt instead. The filling uses half an onion and half a tomato, so save the other half for the fresh, cilantro-based aj\u00ed, to serve with the empanadas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
