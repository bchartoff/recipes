Guanciale provides salt and fat, while Pecorino Romano and egg yolks mixed with pasta water \u2014 a prized Italian secret \u2014 help create the velvety sauce.\u00a0To truly gild the lily, consider a raw egg yolk on top of the pasta. Artichokes, a Roman favorite, come to this dish to soak up the flavors of the guanciale while melting into the pasta. The traditional pasta used in trattorias is tonnarelli, but spaghetti or bucatini are perfect substitutes.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Anna Francese Gass"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/02/dining/ag-artichoke-carbonara/merlin_205954392_c64254c9-1a95-4d4e-8131-35d928e09a1b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "guanciale, pecorino romano", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1356}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound spaghetti", "4 ounces guanciale or pancetta", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish", "12 ounces frozen or canned artichoke quarters, defrosted or drained", "6 large egg yolks, plus 4 yolks for an optional garnish", "1/4 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
