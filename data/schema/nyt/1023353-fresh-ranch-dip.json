In this superbly simple recipe, a tub of Greek yogurt is transformed into a delicious dip that\u2019s loosely inspired by the dominant flavors of ranch dressing. Add a handful of fragrant dill and chives, brighten things up with a little lemon juice and lemon zest, and you have yourself a party for a crowd (or for one!). This dip can be made a day in advance and travels well if kept cool.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/27/dining/22COOLERSREX2/22COOLERSREX2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "chives, dill, greek yogurt, lemon, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 85}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (16-ounce) container plain Greek yogurt, preferably full-fat", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated\u00a0\u00a0", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh dill leaves", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced chives", "1 small lemon", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "Potato chips, Persian cucumbers or other crudit\u00e9s, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the yogurt in a medium bowl.
