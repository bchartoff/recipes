{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Tunisian Eggplant and Pepper Frittata", "description": "In Tunisia, baked omelets sometimes contain fish, while in Greece and Iran, yogurt is often stirred into the mix. Baked frittatas are easy to make and hold well in the refrigerator, and they\u2019re equally good hot, cold or at room temperature. Make one for dinner, and pack up the leftovers for lunch. Many of my favorite Tunisian omelets are baked in the oven. This one can range from mildly spicy to very spicy, depending on your taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/03/02/science/01recipehealth_600/01recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "Serves six to eight", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "healthy, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 150, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "348 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 to 1 1/4 pounds eggplant (1 large or 2 to 4 small)", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1 medium red bell pepper, diced", "Salt to taste", "2 to 4 garlic cloves to taste, minced", "8 eggs", "1/3 cup minced flat-leaf parsley", "2 ounces Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated or cut in small cubes 1/2 cup, tightly packed", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne (more to taste)", "1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon harissa dissolved in 1 tablespoon water more to taste; optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
