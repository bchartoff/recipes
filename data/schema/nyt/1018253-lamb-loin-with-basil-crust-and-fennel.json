{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Loin With Basil Crust and Fennel", "description": "In July and August I use a lot of fresh basil. I love to use it as a coating on a roasted loin of lamb. When the meat is sliced, there is the beautiful green of the crust and the gorgeous pink of rare lamb, the colors arranged on a pale creamy bed of quickly cooked fennel. There are three steps to cooking the loin, a cut you can get by asking your butcher to debone a rack of lamb. I saut\u00e9 the meat to brown and caramelize the outside, then I roast it a bit, coat it with the basil crust and roast it again.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michel Richard"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "basil, fennel, lamb loin, pernod, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 973, "unsaturatedFatContent": "71 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "90 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "695 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["20 large basil leaves, washed and completely dried", "1 cup vegetable oil", "1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs", "2 cloves garlic, peeled", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 12-ounce boneless lamb loins, silver skin and fat removed", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup chicken broth", "3 tablespoons flour", "1 large egg, beaten", "4 sprigs thyme, for garnish", "8 ounces (1 small bulb) fennel, sliced into fine (1/8 inch or less) julienne", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons Pernod, pastis or other anise-flavored liqueur, or 1 teaspoon aniseed", "2 teaspoons sugar", "Juice from 1 lemon", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "To prepare lamb:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, heat oil to 300 degrees.
