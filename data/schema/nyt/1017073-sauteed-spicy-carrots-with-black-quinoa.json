{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saut\u00e9ed Spicy Carrots With Black Quinoa", "description": "This is inspired by a classic Moroccan spiced cooked carrot salad (Ommok Houriya is one variation of the transliteration). Carrots and cumin have long been a favorite combination of mine; added to this mix is fresh green chile and crushed coriander. I finish this off with a sprinkling of black quinoa and fresh mint (cilantro would also be good). If on the off-chance you can find a selection of multicolored carrots \u2013 yellow, purple, and orange \u2013 the dish will be all the more beautiful, but it is pretty enough with regular orange carrots. Cook them long enough to bring out the sweetness, which means longer than crisp-tender. They should be soft, but not mushy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/16/science/17recipeforhealth/17recipeforhealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 66}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 93, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "302 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 to 2 serrano or jalape\u00f1o chiles, minced", "2 teaspoons coriander seeds, lightly toasted and coarsely ground or crushed", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, lightly toasted and coarsely ground or crushed", "2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced on the diagonal, about 1/4 inch thick", "1 1/2 teaspoons sugar", "Salt", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter (optional)", "1/4 to 1/3 cup cooked black quinoa", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint or cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat and add garlic and chile.
