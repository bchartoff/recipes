{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple-Pecan Galette With Fresh Ginger", "description": "Like a cross between a giant Danish and a frangipane-filled tart, this not-too-sweet galette is perfect for the holidays and beyond. Maple sugar gives it a warm and toasty note, and fresh ginger and allspice, a delicately spicy nuance. You can substitute other nuts for pecans, and walnuts or slivered almonds would work particularly well. And both the dough and filling can be made a few days ahead. Serve this with whipped cream or ice cream for a sophisticated dessert, then save the leftovers for breakfast the next day. An unadorned slice is fantastic with coffee.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/dining/23apperex1/merlin_178579398_e4e940be-576d-4a5d-9b2a-004ca8bc29bf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "bourbon, butter, maple sugar, pecan, fall, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 566}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 2/3 cups/215 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "10 tablespoons/145 grams unsalted butter (1 1/4 stick), cold and cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 1/2 cups/150 grams whole pecans, lightly toasted (see Note)", "3/4 cup/110 grams maple sugar (or use brown sugar, preferably muscovado or powdered jaggery), plus more for sprinkling", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick), at room temperature and cut into 1-inch cubes", "1 large egg, at room temperature, beaten", "1 tablespoon bourbon, brandy or rum (optional)", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling", "Whipped cream or ice cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Crack the egg into a measuring cup and beat it with a fork.
