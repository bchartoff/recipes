In this recipe, that seasoned oil is used to fry capers, char scallions and sauce whole-grain noodles. It\u2019s balanced with spring\u2019s sweetest vegetables: thinly sliced asparagus, crunchy snap peas or snow peas, slackened only slightly by salt and residual heat from the pan. Feel free to trade the scallions for garlic scapes or leeks, add fava beans or peas to the noodles in their final minutes of boiling or top the finished dish with pea greens or soft herbs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/dining/18PASTAREX1-soba/merlin_205476504_a6e12a98-d855-4072-90b0-7559345cbd63-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, noodles, pastas, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, mackerel, soba noodles, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 114}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "2 (3- to 5-ounce) cans mackerel or sardines packed in olive oil", "2 bunches scallions (about 12), ends trimmed, white and green parts thinly sliced", "1/4 cup drained capers, patted dry", "2 cups trimmed and thinly sliced asparagus, snap peas, snow peas or a mix (1 bunch asparagus or 6 ounces peas)", "8.8 to 12 ounces soba noodles or whole wheat pasta (depending on package size)", "1 lemon, zested and juiced, plus more juice as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
