{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Mushroom Parmigiana", "description": "This smart weeknight dinner offers all the comforting flavors of a classic Parmigiana, but with minimal work. Earthy portobello mushrooms are used here, offering a perfect cradle for the red sauce and creamy mozzarella. Use good quality store-bought marinara sauce (vodka, arrabiata or amatriciana), a much-underrated pantry item that can turn around a meal quickly. This flexible recipe can be scaled up or down without too much fuss. It accounts for two portobello mushrooms per person, but if you\u2019re serving them with pasta or a salad, you could reduce to one each. The basil-scented bread crumbs finish the mushrooms with a lovely, herbaceous crunch. Extra bread crumbs keep well in an airtight container and are wonderful for topping pasta, salads, soups and roasted vegetables.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/06/dining/hm-sheet-pan-mushroom-parmigiana/hm-sheet-pan-mushroom-parmigiana-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "marinara sauce, mozzarella, portobello, sheet-pan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2366}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, halved (1 pint)", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 portobello mushrooms, stems removed", "3 cups store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015987-classic-marinara-sauce\">homemade</a> marinara sauce", "3 cups (12 ounces) shredded low-moisture mozzarella", "1 cup panko bread crumbs", "1/2 cup (1/2 ounce) basil leaves, finely chopped, plus more leaves for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
