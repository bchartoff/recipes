{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Salmon With Asparagus, Lemon and Brown Butter", "description": "Ready in just 15 minutes, this fast dinner combines silky salmon with a vibrant green medley of asparagus and peas. While the fish roasts, the vegetables and sauce come together in one pan on the stovetop. Thinly slicing the asparagus is the trick to maintaining a crisp texture that complements the tender salmon, while bright lemon juice and zingy capers balance the nutty brown butter sauce. Parsley is used here to finish, but dill or tarragon would also be lovely. Leftover vegetables make a fantastic omelet filling the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/18/dining/kc-roasted-salmon-with-asparagus/kc-roasted-salmon-with-asparagus-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "seafood, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, brown butter, peas, salmon, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1083}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and pepper", "1 pound asparagus, tough stems trimmed, stalks sliced 1/4-inch-thick on a slight bias (leave tips whole)", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus wedges for serving", "2 tablespoons drained capers", "1/2 cup thawed frozen peas", "1/4 cup coarsely chopped parsley, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
