{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Soda Bread With Oats", "description": "For years I\u2019ve been trying to make a moist soda bread loaf like the kind I love to eat when I\u2019m in Ireland. Finally I\u2019ve achieved it with this recipe, which is adapted from Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s recipe for Fallon & Byrne Soda Bread (Fallon & Byrne is a restaurant in Dublin). The bread is a whole-wheat loaf with both rolled and steel-cut (pinhead) oats, and does not have the hard crust that round soda breads can have. One reason is that the moist dough is baked at a lower temperature than free-form soda bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/18/science/17recipehealth/17recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 loaf, about 12 slices", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 145}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 182, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "549 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Soft butter for the bread pan", "125 grams (approximately 1 cup) whole-wheat flour", "62 grams (approximately 1/2 cup) unbleached all-purpose or bread flour", "25 grams (2 rounded tablespoons) steel-cut oats, either regular or quick-cooking", "40 grams (approximately 1/3 cup) rolled oats", "8 grams (approximately 2 teaspoons, tightly packed) brown sugar", "3.5 grams (1/2 teaspoon) salt", "10 grams (2 teaspoons) baking soda, sifted", "290 grams (approximately 1 1/4 cups) buttermilk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
