This hearty dish has a rich, earthy flavor. Although it takes about twice as long as a risotto to cook, it doesn\u2019t require tending.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/dining/mrs-farro-mushrooms-horizontal/mrs-farro-mushrooms-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, one pot", "keywords": "fall, farro, mushroom, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1362}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 323, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "769 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 ounce (1/2 cup, approximately) dried porcini mushrooms", "1 quart chicken stock or vegetable stock", "1 1/2 cups farro", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "1 pound cremini mushrooms or wild mushrooms (or a mixture of the two), cleaned, trimmed and sliced", "Salt to taste", "2 large garlic cloves, green shoots removed, minced", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 to 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (1/4 to 1/2 cup)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the farro in a bowl, and pour on enough hot water to cover by an inch.

Cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, about three minutes. Add the fresh mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until they begin to soften and sweat. Add salt to taste, the garlic and rosemary. Continue to cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are tender, about five minutes. Add the farro and reconstituted dried mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until the grains of farro are separate and beginning to crackle, about two minutes. Stir in the wine and cook, stirring until the wine has been absorbed. Add all but about 1 cup of the stock, and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer 50 minutes or until the farro is tender; some of the grains will be beginning to splay. Remove the lid, and stir vigorously from time to time. Taste and adjust seasoning. There should be some liquid remaining in the pot but not too much. If the farro is submerged in stock, raise the heat and cook until there is just enough to moisten the grains, like a sauce. If there is not, stir in the remaining stock. If not serving right away, cover and let stand. Just before serving, bring back to a simmer, add the Parmesan, parsley and pepper, and stir together. Remove from the heat and serve."}]}
