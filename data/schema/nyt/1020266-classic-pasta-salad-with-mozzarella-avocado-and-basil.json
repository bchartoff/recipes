{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Pasta Salad With Mozzarella, Avocado and Basil", "description": "With its colorful jumble of tomatoes, avocado, olives, mozzarella and cucumber, this has everything you\u2019ve ever wanted in a pasta salad. But feel free to customize the ingredients to suit your own tastes (see Tip), and to add lemon and salt to the dressing to taste. As long as you don\u2019t overcook the pasta, and add it while still hot to the dressing, you really can\u2019t go wrong. Make this a few hours ahead so the flavors have a chance to meld, but be sure not to add the avocado until just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/12/dining/07apperex4/merlin_155267094_b3f6e9fc-3368-4098-a7f8-7c49fa30bcd7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, pastas, salads and dressings", "keywords": "avocado, cherry, cucumber, mozzarella, pasta, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 477}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons minced shallot or red onion", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "Fine sea salt, as needed", "1 pound short pasta, such as campanelle, fusilli or farfalle", "1 ripe avocado, peeled, pitted and diced", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved", "1/2 cup sliced cucumber", "1 pound fresh mozzarella, cut into bite-size cubes", "1/4 cup shaved Parmesan", "1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh basil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To prepare the dressing, in a large bowl, whisk together shallot, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.
