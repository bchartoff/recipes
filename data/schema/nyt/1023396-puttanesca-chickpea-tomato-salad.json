{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Puttanesca Chickpea-Tomato Salad", "description": "This recipe turns tomato salad into a meal by marrying creamy beans with some of the briny, salty ingredients found in\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11583-pasta-puttanesca\">pasta puttanesca</a>, like tomatoes, capers, olives and garlic. While Parmesan isn\u2019t traditional to puttanesca, coarsely chopped pebbles of it add bursts of umami to this salad. Feel free to omit the cheese for a vegan dish, or embellish the mix with fresh or dried chile, tinned fish or more vegetables. This recipe is not only adaptable but also improves as it sits: The tomato juices mingle with the oil, olives and capers \u2014 and the beans drink it all up.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/09/dining/as-puttanesca-bean-salad/merlin_210911910_d69c8c51-0ad0-4e0a-9411-b75390ea923e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "chickpea, olives, parmesan, salad, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 768}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes of any size, cut into 1- or 2-bite pieces", "3 cups cooked, rinsed chickpeas, white beans or a mix (homemade or from two 15-ounce cans)", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped parsley leaves and stems", "1 1/2 ounces Parmesan, coarsely chopped or crumbled (about 1/3 cup)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup kalamata olives, torn in half and pitted", "3 tablespoons drained capers", "1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1 small garlic clove, finely grated", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, stir together the tomatoes, chickpeas, parsley, Parmesan, olive oil, olives, capers, lemon juice and garlic.
