{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sekihan (Red Bean Sticky Rice)", "description": "Steamed sticky rice tinted red with adzuki beans is essential Japanese celebration food, for graduations, festivals, milestone birthdays and even first periods (to the extreme embarrassment of teenage girls). Sekihan is usually one of many dishes on the table, and more than pairing with any particular flavor, it conveys a sense of ceremony. In Japan, it\u2019s not essential to osechi ryori, New Year\u2019s cooking, but for some Japanese and many Japanese-Americans, sekihan is part of welcoming the New Year. This recipe was adapted from Gaye Sasaki Chinn, whose family has been celebrating the Japanese New Year in Seattle for more than a century. The internet is rife with shortcut-recipes for making sekihan in a rice cooker, but if you\u2019re going to make it only for special occasions, it\u2019s worth taking the time to steam the rice, as the Sasakis do.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hannah Kirshner"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/25/dining/25OSECHIREX2/merlin_166106922_574d0c78-bf3e-432d-9c97-0e1c66b1c13a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 small servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "black sesame seeds, dried beans, glutinous rice, rice, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup dried adzuki beans (small ones, if you have a choice)", "2 cups mochi rice (Japanese glutinous rice)", "2 teaspoons black sesame seeds", "1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before (or at least 4 hours before) you make sekihan, cook the beans and soak the rice in the red bean-cooking liquid (through Step 4): In a small saucepan, combine the dried beans and 2 cups water.
