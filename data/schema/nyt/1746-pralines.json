Her friend, Mary Cooper \u201ccan do anything: she canes chairs, she's an excellent gardener, she even makes her own cheese. And at Christmas she always makes me the best pecan pralines I have ever tasted.\u201d Ms. Cooper was kind enough to share her recipe with Ms. Reed who, in turn, shared it with us. As you spoon the warm praline mixture onto the parchment paper, work quickly. It dries in a snap. Some have been known to sprinkle the tops of the wet pralines with flaky sea salt before they harden.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Reed"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/12/dining/pralines/pralines-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "dark brown sugar, pecan, dessert, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 49}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 112, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "8 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 cup evaporated milk", "1 cup pecan halves or pieces", "2 tablespoons butter", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a deep, 2-quart heavy saucepan, combine the brown sugar, granulated sugar and milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugars melt.
