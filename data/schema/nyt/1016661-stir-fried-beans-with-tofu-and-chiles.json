{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Beans With Tofu and Chiles", "description": "This crunchy, colorful stir-fry has an added kick from serrano chiles. I can\u2019t resist buying an array of beans when they\u2019re at summer farmers\u2019 markets. I love to mix yellow and green beans in this crunchy, colorful stir-fry, but don\u2019t hesitate to make it if all you can find is green. For added kick and color I threw in some serrano chiles from my garden that had ripened to bright red. Thai chiles will work too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, high fiber, high protein, kosher, low cholesterol, vegan, vegetarian, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 208}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "580 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["One 14-ounce box firm tofu, drained and cut in 1/4-inch thick, 2-inch by 3/4-inch dominoes", "1 to 2 tablespoons soy sauce (to taste)", "1 tablespoon Chinese cooking sherry (Shaoxing rice wine) or dry sherry", "1/2 cup vegetable stock, chicken stock, or water", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt, to taste", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon sugar, to taste", "1 teaspoon cornstarch or arrowroot dissolved in 2 tablespoons vegetable stock, chicken stock, or water", "2 tablespoons peanut, canola, sunflower, or grape seed oil", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1 or 2 Thai or serrano chiles, minced (to taste)", "1 pound green beans, or 1/2 pound each yellow and green beans, stem ends trimmed", "1 bunch scallions, white and green parts separated", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain and dry tofu slices on paper towels.
