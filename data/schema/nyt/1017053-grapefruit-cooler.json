In keeping with her exacting style, the drink has been painstakingly workshopped down to the last dash of bitters. The combination of grapefruit-flavored vodka, a special grapefruit syrup and a grapefruit twist produces a bright complexity of flavor that one doesn\u2019t expect from a vodka cocktail. And the honey syrup adds a sweet note familiar to anyone who has ever drizzled a line of honey onto her morning grapefruit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/10/dining/10VODKA3/10VODKA3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT2M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "for one, project", "keywords": "bitters, grapefruit, honey, vodka", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 16}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup honey", "2 cups sugar", "Zest of 1 small grapefruit, plus a twist of rind for garnish", "2 ounces grapefruit-flavored vodka, preferably Belvedere", "3/4 ounce lemon juice", "1 dash Angostura bitters", "1 dash Peychaud\u2019s bitters", "1 sprig mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make honey syrup:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix the honey with 1/2 cup water in a sealed container.
