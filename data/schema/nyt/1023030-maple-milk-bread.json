{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple Milk Bread", "description": "Inspired by the fluffy loaves at White Windmill, a bakery and cafe in Atlanta, this milk bread \u2014 a type of soft, bouncy white bread made with, yes, milk \u2014 is an homage to the Korean American community along the city\u2019s Buford Highway and beyond. Milk bread exists across many cultures, but its distinguishing feature is the tangzhong \u2014 a cooked paste of flour and milk \u2014 that helps keep the bread from drying out. Maple syrup and a sturdier crumb distinguish this loaf from milk breads found at Asian bakeries. This one, which appears in \u201cKorean American: Food That Tastes Like Home,\u201d by Eric Kim (Clarkson Potter, 2022), has a deeply savory, pancake-sweet flavor and tastes fabulous plain, fresh out of the oven, or toasted, buttered and adorned with jam; honey and flaky sea salt are equally welcome as toppings.

Dust a clean work surface with some of the flour and turn the dough out onto the surface. Dust some more flour on top of the dough and on your hands, and knead the dough into a ball using both hands. As you start to feel the dough get sticky, add more of the flour. The goal here is to not use more than that \u00bd cup of flour to knead the dough and, at the same time, to develop enough gluten in it so that it\u2019s no longer sticky, 5 to 7 minutes. Alternatively, knead with a stand mixer: Transfer the dough from the pot to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Knead on medium-low speed for 15 minutes; it will become pretty sticky and cling to the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Dust some more flour on top of the dough and on your hands, and form the dough into a ball using both hands, adding more flour as needed."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
