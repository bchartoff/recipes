(If you choose to make it all in one day, you may want to use a fat separator to strain the sauce before serving.) For more heat, add a little hot paprika or cayenne.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05PASSOVER1/05PASSOVER1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, eggplant, swiss chard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 190}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 542, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1204 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 to 8 tablespoons sesame or olive oil", "2 medium eggplants (about 2 pounds)", "Sea salt, to taste", "1 large onion, chopped", "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 whole chicken, 4 to 5 pounds, cut into 8 pieces", "1 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock or water", "1 dried lime (optional, available at Middle Eastern groceries)", "1 bunch Swiss chard or spinach (about 1 pound), cleaned, trimmed and roughly chopped into 1- to 2-inch pieces (including stems)", "Juice of 1 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees and brush a baking sheet (or two, if needed) liberally with 3 tablespoons oil.
