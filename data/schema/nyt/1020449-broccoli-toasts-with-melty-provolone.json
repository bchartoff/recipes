{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broccoli Toasts With Melty Provolone", "description": "A beautifully assembled toast can make a lovely light dinner. In this version, blanched broccoli is cooked in olive oil that's been infused with garlic and anchovies (always optional) until it\u2019s very tender, then it\u2019s piled onto toasted bread. Grated extra-sharp provolone, which is a nice complement to the mildly sweet broccoli, is sprinkled on top, then the toasts are broiled until the cheese is melted and golden brown. You can use cauliflower, broccoli rabe or thickly sliced sweet peppers in place of the broccoli, but be sure to cook your vegetables until they are velvety soft \u2014 it provides a nice contrast to the crunchy bread. While these toasts work well on their own, they make an equally good accompaniment to roast chicken or grilled fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/dining/ch-broccoli-toasts/ch-broccoli-toasts-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, breads, finger foods, sandwiches, vegetables", "keywords": "anchovy, broccoli, garlic, lemon, olive oil, provolone, red pepper flakes, appetizer, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 230}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 head of broccoli, about 1 pound, trimmed and cut into small florets", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 anchovy fillets, roughly chopped (optional)", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest", "Black pepper", "6 (3/4-inch thick) slices of a 10-inch round peasant loaf", "3 ounces grated provolone, preferably extra-sharp"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and blanch the broccoli for 2 to 3 minutes.
