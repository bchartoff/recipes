{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Wheat Apple Pecan Scones", "description": "As I was playing around with the mixture for these not-too-sweet scones I learned that if I used as much liquid (in the form of buttermilk or yogurt) as I usually do in my scones, they wouldn\u2019t be flaky. That is because the apple provides plenty of liquid. You just need to add enough buttermilk or yogurt to bring the dough together. Otherwise you will have drop biscuits and they will have a consistency more akin to a soft cookie than to a biscuit or scone. Juicy apples like Braeburn, Crispin and Empire work well for these scones.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/18/science/20recipehealthscones/20recipehealthscones-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "12 scones", "recipeCuisine": "american, irish", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, snack, quick breads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, fall, winter, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 138}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 193, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "139 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 apple, grated (145 grams grated apple)", "1 tablespoon lime or lemon juice", "2 teaspoons lemon or lime zest", "1 1/4 cups / 160 grams whole wheat flour,", "3/4 cup / 90 grams unbleached all-purpose flour (or use all whole wheat flour)", "1 tablespoon / 12 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon / 2 grams baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon / 2 grams salt", "1/2 cup / 55 grams rolled oats", "2 tablespoons /30 grams raw brown sugar", "6 tablespoons / 85 grams unsalted butter", "Up to 1/4 cup / 60 grams buttermilk or yogurt", "1/2 cup / 60 grams chopped pecans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
