{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Make-Ahead Martini", "description": "Daniel Osborne, the bar manager at Abigail Hall in Portland, Ore., can satisfy orders for gin and vodka martinis and rye and bourbon manhattans in an instant. Each drink is mixed in bulk, diluted and chilled well ahead of time. Advocates of this process say it results in not only quicker service but also a better, colder and more viscous drink. \u201cDilution and chill are main ingredients\u201d in a martini, Mr. Osborne said. To find out for yourself, you need to plan only a day before cocktail hour. This recipe will yield two drinks. If you wish to have more ready in advance, simply double or triple the measurements.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/dining/14premixrex/14premixrex-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "2 drinks", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "dry vermouth, gin, lemon peel, olives", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 202, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "27 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ounces gin, preferably Beefeater", "2 ounces distilled water", "1 ounce dry vermouth, preferably Dolin", "2 lemon twists or olives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the gin, distilled water and vermouth in a mixing glass.
