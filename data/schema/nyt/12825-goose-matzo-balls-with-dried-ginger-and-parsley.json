The recipe, created by then chef Andr\u00e1s Singer, calls for goose schmaltz in place of chicken, hand-crushed matzo instead of preground matzo meal and a bit of dried ginger to cut through the richness. The combination yields what Mr. Sax called \"the greatest matzo ball on earth.\"", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Sax"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/10/dining/Matzo-Balls2/Matzo-Balls2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "20 matzo balls", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "goose fat, matzo, parsley, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 99, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "55 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 whole matzos", "150 milliliters liquid goose fat", "4 eggs", "1 teaspoon dry ginger (or ground fresh)", "1/2 cup fresh chopped parsley", "Salt and pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Crumble matzos, mix in other ingredients\nslowly, rolling dough into squash-ballsize\nballs.
