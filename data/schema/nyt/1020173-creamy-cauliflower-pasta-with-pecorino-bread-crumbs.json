{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Cauliflower Pasta With Pecorino Bread Crumbs", "description": "Equal parts cauliflower and pasta, this one-skillet dinner is a vegetable-forward version of macaroni and cheese. A whole head of cauliflower browns and caramelizes in a skillet before being simmered with heavy cream, pecorino cheese and a bit of lemon zest, breaking down into a special (and yes, decadent) sauce to coat the pasta shape of your choosing. For those looking to make it their own, this pasta could absolutely handle a bit of chopped bacon saut\u00e9ed with the cauliflower, or handfuls of leafy greens tossed in at the end to wilt. Whatever you do, do not skip the bread crumbs \u2014 they are a not-so-stealthy vehicle for more cheese, and also add much-needed texture to the finished dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/17/dining/15romanrex/15romanrex-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "bread crumbs, cauliflower, pasta, pecorino, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1723}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 775, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "976 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 ounces rigatoni, ziti or campanelle", "6 tablespoons olive oil", "3/4 cup fresh coarse or panko bread crumbs", "1/2 cup finely grated pecorino cheese, plus more for serving", "1 large shallot, finely chopped", "1 medium head cauliflower (about 2 pounds), outer leaves and stem removed, sliced about 1/2-inch thick (it\u2019s O.K. if it crumbles)", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, plus more for serving", "1/2 cup finely chopped chives", "Red-pepper flakes (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pasta pot filled with salted water to a boil.
