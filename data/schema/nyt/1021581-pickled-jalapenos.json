More than a condiment, they are an absolute necessity. Incredibly versatile, they can be tucked into tacos, quesadillas and sandwiches, mixed into tuna salads or eggs for omelets, or served as garnishes, crowning <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021572-the-original-nachos\">nachos</a>, hot dogs and pizzas. The tangy brine, which can be used to punch up any vinaigrette, tames the heat of the chiles. There are countless store-bought options \u2014 and people tend to be loyal to particular brands \u2014 but pickling your own is easy, and allows you to customize to taste, altering the vegetable ratios, herbs or sugar content. Inspired by fruit-based vinegars available in the Mexican countryside, this version combines white distilled vinegar with natural rice vinegar, adding a dose of sweetness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/04/dining/29nachosrex5/merlin_179172879_80c35890-7b5f-4515-882f-7786eb7e521c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT12H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 7 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "pickles, vegetables", "keywords": "carrot, jalape\u00f1o, oregano, pearl onion, vinegar, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 201}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup vegetable oil", "6 ounces white pearl onions (or trimmed spring onion bulbs)", "4 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 pound whole jalape\u00f1os (stems intact)", "1/2 pound medium carrots, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick on the diagonal", "2 cups distilled white vinegar", "1 cup unseasoned rice vinegar", "5 dried bay leaves", "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1 teaspoon dried thyme", "5 whole cloves, stems removed and discarded, rounded tops crushed between fingertips", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 tablespoons kosher or sea salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) skillet or a heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high until hot but not smoking.
