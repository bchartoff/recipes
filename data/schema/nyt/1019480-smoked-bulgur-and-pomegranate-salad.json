{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoked Bulgur and Pomegranate Salad", "description": "This colorful and flavorful mountain of bulgur, flecked with pomegranates, walnuts and herbs, is typical of the out-of-the box thinking of the chef Ori Menashe. He learned how to char vegetables in a heavy pan from chefs from Mexico City, who did a pop-up at his Los Angeles restaurant Bestia before it opened and showed him their technique for adding a smoky flavor to rice. (Libyan and Egyptian cooks also have started stews this way for centuries.) Just be careful about the hot pepper as it chars; it might make you cough, so keep the window open for the 6 minutes it takes to do this. This recipe yields 8 cups of cooked bulgur, but you only need 6 cups for the salad. Use those leftover 2 cups in other salads or add them to soups for heft and texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/12/dining/12orirex1/12orirex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, grains and rice, salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, bulgur, pomegranate molasses, pomegranate seeds, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 large yellow Spanish onion, peeled and quartered", "1 celery stalk, halved crosswise", "1 small carrot, peeled and halved crosswise", "3 fresh bay leaves (or use 1 dried)", "1 Fresno or Serrano chile, halved lengthwise", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 pound coarse bulgur (about 2 2/3 cups)", "1/4 cup red wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon minced shallot", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup pomegranate seeds", "1 cup toasted walnuts, roughly chopped", "4 tablespoons finely diced red onion", "1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped", "16 fresh basil leaves, torn into small pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 garlic clove, finely minced", "1 Serrano chile, seeded and finely minced", "4 tablespoons fresh dill, finely snipped", "1 teaspoon pomegranate molasses"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the bulgur: In a large, dry heavy pan over high heat, use tongs to char the onion, celery, carrot, bay leaves and chile until completely burnt, about 6 to 8 minutes.
