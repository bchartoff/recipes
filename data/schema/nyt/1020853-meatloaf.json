{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meatloaf", "description": "Originally created as a tasty way to use up leftover vegetables and to stretch meat further during lean times, meatloaf has become the ultimate comfort food. This one is a classic version, blending ground beef, pork and veal with simple pantry seasonings, but you should feel free to use your preferred combination of meat, such as half pork and half beef. Milk-soaked bread ensures a tender meatloaf, and baking it freeform \u2014 on a baking sheet instead of a loaf pan \u2014 provides more surface area for the tangy-sweet tomato glaze to caramelize as it bakes. Leftover slices can be crisped in a skillet and served with a salad or tucked into a sandwich. Alternatively, freeze one uncooked loaf for the next time you need to put dinner on the table with ease; simply thaw the night before and bake as directed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/04/dining/kc-classic-meatloaf/merlin_168064464_f606aa14-f0ee-4550-9921-a8305c467735-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings (2 loaves)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "ground beef, ground pork, ground veal, ketchup, worcestershire sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped (about 2 cups)", "5 large garlic cloves, minced (about 2 tablespoons)", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "3 (1/2-inch-thick) slices white sandwich bread (about 3 ounces), torn into small pieces", "2/3 cup whole milk", "3 large eggs", "1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf or curly parsley", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 pound ground chuck beef", "1 pound ground pork", "1 pound ground veal", "1/2 cup ketchup", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the meatloaf: Heat oven to 350 degrees and grease a rimmed baking sheet with oil.
