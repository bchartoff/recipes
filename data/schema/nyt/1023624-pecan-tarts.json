{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pecan Tarts", "description": "Pecan pastries are synonymous with the American South; this recipe is a handheld compendium of community. The flavor profile mirrors its larger cousin \u2014 the full-sized pecan pie \u2014 but tarts serve just as ably as a crowd-pleaser. This pastry dough comes together easily, but be sure to chill it for at least an hour and a half before forming your tart shells in the pan. And resist the urge to overfill each pastry cup: the sweet, sticky pecan mixture should come only three-quarters of the way up the side because it will rise as it bakes. These pecan tarts can hold at room temperature for several days, if you have any left by then.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Bryan Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/06/magazine/06mag-Eat-site/06mag-Eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "9 tarts", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "cream cheese, make-ahead, pastry flour, pecan, tart, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 253}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup/151 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pan", "4 ounces/114 grams cream cheese, softened", "1 1/3 cups/160 grams pastry flour (or 1 1/3 cups/171 grams all-purpose flour)\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1 large egg", "3/4 cup/165 grams packed brown sugar", "1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon honey\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "2/3 cup/79 grams very finely chopped pecans\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pastry: Beat softened butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer or by hand until thoroughly combined.
