{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banh Xeo", "description": "Banh xeo are Vietnamese rice pancakes filled with various vegetables and meats. Thin and crispy, the finished pancakes are cut into pieces, tucked into lettuce wraps, and finished with fragrant herbs and a spicy nuoc cham dipping sauce. This recipe features the classic shrimp and pork, using bacon for the hit of smoky flavor. If bean sprouts are unavailable, try finely shredded cabbage instead. The batter can be made two days ahead and stored in the refrigerator. When ready to use, bring it to room temperature and whisk until well blended, adding water if needed to thin the batter. (It should be slightly thicker than the texture of heavy cream.) Banh xeo are best eaten as they are made, but if you need to keep them warm while making all four pancakes, heat the oven to 200 degrees and set a rack over a baking sheet. As you make the pancakes, transfer them to the rack to keep warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/10/dining/kc-banh-xeo/merlin_175276515_31f8fd55-34e5-4835-9707-cb6a809c6841-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, seafood, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "bacon, bean sprouts, coconut milk, fish sauce, herbs, rice flour, scallion, shrimp, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 254}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup stoneground white rice flour (about 140 grams), such as Bob\u2019s Red Mill", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 1/2 cups boiling water", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened coconut milk", "1 cup thinly sliced scallions", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 limes)", "3 tablespoons Asian fish sauce", "1 tablespoon turbinado sugar", "1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 2 cloves)", "1/2 teaspoon minced fresh chiles, such as Thai, serrano or jalape\u00f1o, or red-pepper flakes", "1/2 pound medium peeled and deveined shrimp, halved lengthwise", "3 slices bacon (about 3 ounces), chopped into 1-inch pieces", "Kosher salt", "2 cups bean sprouts (about 4 ounces)", "1/4 cup canola oil", "Lettuce leaves, such as green-leaf, red-leaf or butter lettuce", "1 cup mixed herbs (mint, basil and cilantro leaves)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the batter: In a small bowl, whisk flour, cornstarch, salt and turmeric.
