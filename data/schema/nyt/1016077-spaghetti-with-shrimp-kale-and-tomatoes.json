{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaghetti With Shrimp, Kale and Tomatoes", "description": "I like to use black kale for this. I blanch it in the pasta cooking water, then I add the chopped blanched leaves to the tomato sauce at the end of cooking, just so they will heat through and soften a little more. I sear the shrimp and make the tomato sauce in the same pan. You can toss shrimp in the tomato sauce or just top each serving with them, which is the way to go if there are vegetarians at the table.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/25/science/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, low sugar, nut-free, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 191}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 427, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "506 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium-size bunch black kale, stemmed and washed well in 2 changes water", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "12 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (to taste)", "1-14 1/2-ounce can chopped tomatoes in juice", "1/4 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon oregano or thyme (to taste)", "3/4 pound spaghetti", "Crumbled feta or freshly grated Parmesan for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large pasta pot with water and bring to a boil.
