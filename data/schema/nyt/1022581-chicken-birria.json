This weeknight version features juicy chicken thighs for faster cooking. A quick blender sauce of dried chiles, garlic and tomatoes creates a smoky and rich base for the stew, which deepens in flavor as the chicken simmers. Here, the birria is enjoyed as a stew, but it also makes terrific tacos: Simply dip tortillas in the warm broth, fill them with shredded chicken and top with chopped white onion and cilantro, then fold in half and pan-fry until golden and crispy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/28/dining/kc-chicken-birria/merlin_195504894_4d36142e-8b17-466d-971b-8908f146dab2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "ancho chili, chicken thigh, guajillo chiles, tomatoes", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1421}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed, seeded and torn into large pieces", "3 dried ancho chiles, stemmed, seeded and torn into large pieces", "3 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes", "2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar", "3 large garlic cloves, peeled\u00a0", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs\u00a0", "1/2 cup finely chopped white onion (from 1/2 medium onion), plus more for garnish", "2 teaspoons dried oregano", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 dried bay leaf", "Chopped cilantro, for garnish", "1 lime, quartered, for serving", "Rice, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan over high heat, combine the dried chiles and 1 cup of the broth, and bring to a boil, stirring to submerge the chiles.
