{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roman-Style Spring Lamb With Fresh Sugar Snap Pea Salad", "description": "The Romans make a classic dish in the spring with very young milk-fed lamb. Such meat is hard to find in American supermarkets, but the technique, which involves a short braise in vinegar and water with a boost of anchovy at the end, works fine with chunks of lamb cut from a leg or roast of any young lamb. This recipe is built on the precise technique for abbacchio alla cacciatora that Marcella Hazan offered in \"The Classic Italian Cookbook,\" with some freshening up. The braised chunks of meat are topped with a crunchy <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018708-sugar-snap-pea-salad-with-calabrian-pepper-and-fennel\">sugar snap pea salad</a> that carries the heat of Calabria peppers, a recipe from Whitney Otawka, who grew up in California and now cooks in Georgia. (The salad is a great stand-alone recipe, too, and one that would be terrific alongside a ham, if yours is an Easter ham family.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/12/dining/12LAMB3/12LAMB3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, lamb, rosemary, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 78}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "3 pounds young lamb from the shoulder or the leg, cut into uniform 2-inch chunks", "2 tablespoons cooking fat, preferably lard or olive oil", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary", "1 teaspoon chopped garlic", "2 teaspoons flour", "1/2 cup white wine vinegar or Champagne vinegar", "4 large anchovy fillets, chopped", "3 cups sugar snap pea salad with Calabrian pepper and fennel (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018708-sugar-snap-pea-salad-with-calabrian-pepper-and-fennel\">see recipe</a>), omitting the pecorino Romano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the lamb cubes, tossing a few times to distribute it evenly.
