{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Pea Soup With Miso", "description": "This simple Japanese-inflected soup has a delicate green flavor and a lovely creamy consistency. Served in small bowls, it makes a perfect beginning to a spring meal. Using white miso (shiro miso) keeps the soup light; red miso (a k a miso) gives it a nutty, more earthy flavor. Both are good. Japanese groceries sell fragrant shiso leaves in tiny bunches, and also offer the best choices for soft, silken tofu.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/30/dining/30KIT5/30KIT5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "main course, side dish, peas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 42}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 148, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "659 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon coconut or vegetable oil\n", "1 medium leek, diced, both white and tender green parts\n", "3/4 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed, then chopped\n", "Salt and pepper\n", "4 cups hot chicken broth or dashi\n", "4 tablespoons white or red miso\n", "4 ounces soft tofu\n", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions\n", "A few shiso (perilla) leaves, roughly chopped (optional)\n"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.
