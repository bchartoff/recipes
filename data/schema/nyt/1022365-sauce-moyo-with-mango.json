{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sauce Moyo With Mango", "description": "A chunky blend of fresh tomatoes, red onions, chile and lime juice, sauce moyo can be found across West Africa, particularly in Benin, Togo and Senegal. It's great in hot and humid weather, though it brings a little heat and flavor of its own thanks to the addition of a Scotch bonnet or habanero chile. Fresh tomatoes are traditionally the source of its mild sweetness, but, here, mango is added for a fruity burst of flavor. Seasonal stone fruits, like peaches, apricots and nectarines, will work just as well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/12SAUCESREX7-hot-YK-sauce-moyo-mango/merlin_190353948_ff26f347-39ea-436c-9fda-63fab9f2c23e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "lime juice, onion, scotch bonnet, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 143}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces ripe tomatoes (any size), halved and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick slices", "1/2 small red onion (3 ounces), peeled and thinly sliced (3/4 cup loosely packed)", "1 green Scotch bonnet or habanero chile, halved", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 ripe mango, peeled, pitted and cut into 1/2-inch cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion and chile.
