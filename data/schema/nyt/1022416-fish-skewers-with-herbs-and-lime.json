Topped with herbs and lime juice, it\u2019s a minimalist take that lets the flavors of good, fresh fish shine through. If you have a fish basket and would rather line up the cubes inside that, go right ahead. Just watch it carefully and adjust the cooking time if needed. If you\u2019re looking to add a sauce, this is lovely served with some <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018230-basic-yogurt-sauce\">garlic-spiked yogurt</a> on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/28/dining/23apperex4/23apperex4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood, skewers and kebabs, main course", "keywords": "dill, fish, lime", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 273}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 garlic cloves, finely grated, pressed or minced", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "3 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound thick, dense fish steaks, such as tuna or swordfish, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "Lime wedges, for serving", "2 scallions, white and green parts, trimmed and\u00a0thinly sliced", "1/3 cup chopped dill, mint, parsley, cilantro or a combination"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the grill to high.
