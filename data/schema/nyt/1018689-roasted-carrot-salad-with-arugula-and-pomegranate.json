{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Carrot Salad With Arugula and Pomegranate", "description": "This composed, bright salad of roasted carrots, thinly sliced fennel and arugula gains a fruity depth from a splash of pomegranate molasses in the dressing. You can find pomegranate molasses in Middle Eastern groceries and specialty food shops, and it\u2019s worth seeking out for its complex, sweet-tart acidity. Once opened, it will last for years in your pantry. This salad makes a delightful side dish or light main course, especially if you include the optional toasted walnuts or pita chips, which add a satisfying crunch. If you can find multicolored carrots, this already striking salad becomes even prettier.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/dining/05APPE1/05APPE1-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, arugula, carrot, fennel, pomegranate molasses, pomegranate seeds, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 429}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 265, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "239 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch lengths (halve them if carrots are large)", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, more to taste", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses", "1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, more to taste", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "3 ounces baby arugula (about 3 cups)", "1 fennel bulb, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup fresh dill fronds or mint leaves", "Pomegranate seeds, as needed", "Yogurt, for serving (optional)", "Toasted walnuts or crumbled pita chips, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
