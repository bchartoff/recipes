Chicken thighs are an affordable cut that\u2019s juicy, tender and rich with flavor, but chicken breast could also be used here for leaner (but just as tasty) tacos. Leftovers can be turned into a zesty pasta salad or used as a hearty omelet or frittata filling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/29/dining/kc-green-chile-chicken-tacos/merlin_195505029_f9ef995e-9e40-4636-95f8-86d0dd713ed6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 Servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, tacos, main course", "keywords": "chicken, green chili, tortilla", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 745}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup safflower or canola oil", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion (from 1/2 medium onion)", "1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper (from 1/2 bell pepper)", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "2 (4-ounce) cans chopped green chiles, drained", "1 cup low-sodium chicken broth\u00a0", "8 (6-inch) corn tortillas, warmed or toasted", "Shredded cabbage, store-bought pico de gallo or salsa, sliced avocado, sour cream, and cilantro leaves and tender stems, for serving", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, mix oil with oregano and cumin.
