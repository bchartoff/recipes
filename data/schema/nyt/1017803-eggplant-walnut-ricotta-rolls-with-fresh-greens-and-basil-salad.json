Courtesy of reader Christine Vartanian Datian of Las Vegas, these decadent rolls of Japanese eggplant strips, ricotta and walnuts are colorful and tasty, with an added crunch.\n\nMs. Datian said the dish is influenced by her Armenian heritage. Sometimes she substitutes almonds or pecans for the walnuts and sour cream for the ricotta, depending on her guests, but her preference is the combination of walnuts and ricotta, layered on the strips of Japanese eggplant. She serves it as both an appetizer and a main course, next to a fig and basil salad and with a variety of California red and white wines. She garnishes the dish with parsley and green onions to add more color.\n\n\"It's very, very pretty,\" said Ms. Datian. \"The ricotta and the walnuts with the crunch factor -- people like it, and children like it too.\"", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/06/science/welleggplant/welleggplant-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 Japanese eggplants, sliced lengthwise in 1/2-inch slices", "Kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese", "1/2 cup finely ground walnuts, (about 1 cup whole walnuts ground in a food processor)", "2 cloves garlic, finely grated or chopped", "2-3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 teaspoon dried dill", "1/2 teaspoon sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon nutmeg", "Juice and zest from 1 lemon", "Canola oil", "8-10 cups mixed salad greens", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar", "\u00bc cup candied walnuts", "1 handful basil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash eggplants, cut off and discard stems.
