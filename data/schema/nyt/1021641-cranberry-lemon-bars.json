{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry Lemon Bars", "description": "Cranberries that are quick-cooked into jam add a striking magenta color and complex tartness to these two-toned lemon bars. A thin layer of the classic lemon filling coats the cranberry mix like icing, and lemon zest boiled with the berries echoes the citrus taste of the lemony top. (Its pectin also thickens the jam.) To achieve a sturdy crust that isn\u2019t tough, melted butter is stirred into a flour blend and simply patted into the pan. That vanilla cookie base, generously salted to balance the tangy sweetness on top, comes out crisp and holds up well even as the bars keep in the refrigerator for up to five days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/18/dining/13bakingrex3-bars/merlin_179650401_1c345546-086d-42e6-a2d5-62511090cc00-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 dozen bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bar cookie, cranberry, lemon, make-ahead, plan-ahead, christmas, thanksgiving, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 4837}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (12-ounce/340-gram) bag fresh or frozen cranberries", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "2 to 3 large lemons", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), melted and cooled", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams all-purpose flour", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start preparing the cranberry layer: Combine the cranberries, sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a medium saucepan.
