{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peppermint Patty Shortbreads", "description": "With chocolate ganache, peppermint-flavored marshmallow and a shortbread base, these cookies may seem like a daunting task, but each step of this recipe is simple and will result in a show stopping treat. Reminiscent of a warm cup of peppermint hot chocolate, each cookie is topped with crushed candy canes, but peppermint extract is the key to getting that minty flavor to pop. You can make the shortbread base ahead to save some time; it will stay fresh in an airtight container for up to 3 days. And to get nice peaks on the marshmallow tops, make sure it is significantly cooled before you pipe.\u00a0 (This cookie is one of six cookies that you can make with this <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023720-butter-shortbread-dough\">Butter Shortbread Dough</a> recipe.

Turn the dough out onto a sheet of parchment paper and pat into a 5- by 7-inch rectangle. Place another sheet of parchment over the top and roll the dough into a 1/4-inch-thick piece. Use a floured cookie cutter to stamp out the cookies, and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet, spacing at least 1/2 inch apart. You can push the dough scraps back together and reroll as many times as necessary. Bake until the cookies are light golden brown at the bottom edges, rotating the pan once halfway through baking, about 13 minutes.
