{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basic Sunday-Salad Dressing", "description": "Vinaigrettes are all based on a simple formula that uses roughly three parts oil to one part acid, a rule that achieves balance between the vivid sparkle of vinegar or lemon juice and the slick heaviness of olive oil. You can adjust for taste from there, adding a splash of oil if the dressing tastes too acidic, or a splash of acid if it\u2019s overwhelmed.\n\nDressing advice: Whisk a lot. Start with vinegar and the flavors you\u2019re adding to it: diced shallots, say, or garlic. If there is to be a cheese on the salad, I might add a pinch or two to the dressing early on, to help distribute its flavor. Whisk it around for a while.\n\nAnd then continue to whisk, especially as you add the oil. The best vinaigrettes are emulsified \u2014 that is, they are smooth and at least temporarily stable, the disparate ingredients suspended among one another. (The addition to your dressing of already emulsified mixtures \u2014 maybe mustard or a dollop of mayonnaise \u2014 can help in this regard.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday, condiments", "keywords": "lemon juice, olive oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 173, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "99 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 teaspoon red-wine vinegar", "1 shallot, minced", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt", "freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the lemon juice, vinegar, shallot and mustard in a small bowl.
