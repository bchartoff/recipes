{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Honey-Apple Bread Pudding", "description": "Soft and cakelike challah makes for a deluxe bread pudding. This one is shot through with cubes of apples caramelized in honey, then topped with sliced almonds for crunch. You can assemble the pudding up to two days ahead of time and store it, covered, in the refrigerator. Then pop it into the oven an hour or two before you want to serve it, adding a few minutes onto the baking time. It\u2019s best served warm, when the apples are at their most jamlike. But leftovers served cold from the fridge make a terrific breakfast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/dining/mc-challah-bread-pudding/mc-challah-bread-pudding-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, casseroles, custards and puddings", "keywords": "almond, apple, challah, challah bread, cinnamon, honey, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 141}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 pound challah loaf, cut into 1-by-2-inch pieces", "6 tablespoons honey", "6 apples (about 2 3/4 pounds, an assortment of varieties works well), peeled and diced into 1/2-inch cubes (8 cups)", "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped", "1/2 teaspoon plus a pinch of fine sea salt", "2 cups half-and-half or heavy cream", "1 1/2 cups whole milk", "5 large eggs plus 3 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/2 cup sliced almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees and butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or large gratin dish."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a rimmed baking sheet, spread bread in an even layer.
