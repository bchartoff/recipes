{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Rice With Pigeon Peas", "description": "In 2002, Florence Fabricant spoke with Mark Militello, the chef and owner of the now-closed Mark\u2019s Las Olas in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who brought this recipe to The Times. The chef uses Uncle Ben\u2019s converted rice here on the advice of his cooks Pascal Dieumeme and Orenus Olean. It\u2019s parboiled, and less sticky, to yield firm, separate grains, a nice counter to the earthy pigeon peas. You can start the peas from from scratch, but it\u2019s also fine to use canned or frozen. The whole dish is finished with scallions, bell pepper, thyme and more coconut milk. As tempting as it may be, don\u2019t rush the rice to the table: Let it rest off the heat. It\u2019ll help its texture and flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Militello"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "one pot", "keywords": "coconut milk, pigeon peas, rice, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 24}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 389, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "567 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1 red Scotch bonnet chile", "1 1/2 cups Uncle Ben's rice or long grain rice, rinsed until water runs clear", "3/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk", "1 cup cooked pigeon peas (gandules); canned or frozen can be used", "2 1/4 cups chicken stock", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/3 cup finely chopped scallion (green part only)", "1 medium red bell pepper, seeded, cored and diced", "1/2 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in heavy saucepan.
