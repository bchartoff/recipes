{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Moroccan Shakshuka", "description": "In this shakshuka variation by the San Francisco chef Mourad Lahlou, lamb and beef kefta (meatballs) are browned, then simmered in a spiced tomato-red pepper sauce. Instead of the usual whole eggs poached in the sauce, Mr. Lahlou adds only the yolks, which burst into a luscious orange sauce when tapped with a fork. In his native Morocco, this kind of dish would traditionally be cooked in a tagine, but a large skillet works equally well. Serve this with flatbread for brunch, lunch or dinner. Chef Lahlou garnishes his shakshuka with edible flowers and micro cilantro, as shown here, but tender cilantro springs will do beautifully, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/24/dining/24CHEF2/24CHEF2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, meatballs", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, carrot juice, ground beef, ground lamb, preserved lemon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 190}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large red bell pepper", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 cups finely diced red onion", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "6 cups diced canned tomatoes, preferably San Marzano", "1 cup carrot juice", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste", "3/4 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper", "Pinch of cayenne", "2 1/2 tablespoons minced preserved lemon", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley", "1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, plus tender sprigs for garnish", "6 large egg yolks, at room temperature", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne", "1/4 cup finely diced red onion", "1 tablespoon minced parsley", "1 tablespoon minced cilantro", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "8 ounces ground beef (80 percent lean)", "8 ounces ground lamb", "1 large egg, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Over an open flame on the stove top or under the broiler, roast the red pepper until skin is black and blistered all over, 8 to 12 minutes, turning the pepper as needed.
