{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broccoli Salad With Peanuts and Tahini-Lime Dressing", "description": "Broccoli stalks, often overlooked or tossed in favor of the florets, take center-stage in this summer picnic salad. While many broccoli slaws are made with mayonnaise-based dressings, this one is inspired by the bright flavors of Thai cuisine, and uses sesame oil, lime juice, salted peanuts, scallions and a dash of hot sauce for heat. (Garnish the slaw with fresh Thai basil, if you like.) Tossed with a creamy vegan tahini-lime dressing, the broccoli softens just enough to lose that raw broccoli flavor without giving up any of its satisfying crunch. A food processor or Mandoline makes quick work of the stems, but with a little bit of patience, a good knife does the trick, too. Finally, this salad is best the day it\u2019s made, though its components can be prepared in advance to save time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/04/dining/lh-broccoli-slaw/lh-broccoli-slaw-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, salads and dressings, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "broccoli, garlic, honey, peanut, scallion, sesame oil, soy sauce, tahini, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, tailgate, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2583}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds broccoli (see Tip)", "3/4 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and green parts (3 to 5 scallions)", "1/2 cup lightly salted peanuts, finely chopped", "1/3 cup tahini", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from about 2 limes)", "1/4 cup toasted sesame oil", "2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari", "2 teaspoons honey or agave", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "A few dashes of hot sauce, plus more to taste", "1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro or mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the broccoli stalks and peel them to remove the tough outer layer.
