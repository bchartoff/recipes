{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Swiss Chard and Rice Soup", "description": "In the late spring and early summer we are surrounded by great big bunches of chard with wide stems and lush leaves, tender leeks, the last of the fava beans, first of the green beans and the first of the summer squash, still small and delicate. In not a lot of time, you can do what the French do: make soup. Rice will bulk up the soup. Though a starchy medium-grain rice like Arborio works, this recipe uses white basmati, which swells to four times its original size when cooked. You could try using brown basmati rice, but the color of the soup will be duller. If you\u2019re looking for an easy way to reduce your calorie intake, these soups will help. They\u2019re filling and light, and make great low-calorie meals. This is a simple and comforting soup that is especially delicious in the spring, when Swiss chard is at its sweetest and most tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/19/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, rice, swiss chard, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 138}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 236, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1219 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds Swiss chard (2 generous bunches)", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "2 stalks celery, finely diced", "Salt to taste", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "2 quarts chicken stock, vegetable stock or water", "A bouquet garni made with a bay leaf and a couple of sprigs each parsley and thyme", "1/2 cup basmati rice", "Freshly ground pepper", "Freshly squeezed lemon juice (optional)", "Freshly grated Parmesan for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the bottoms of the chard stems.
