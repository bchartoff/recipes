{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Red Pesto Pasta", "description": "Today, pesto describes many sauces that don\u2019t necessarily adhere to the traditional formula of cheese, basil, nuts and olive oil. This red version, which is inspired by pesto alla Siciliana, the scarlet cousin of green pesto Genovese, leans on sun-dried tomatoes, nuts and tangy roasted red peppers and uses basil as a garnish only. Though pesto is traditionally pounded by hand, a food processor simplifies the effort. This pasta sauce is versatile: Crown it with lemon zest for brightness, or stir in heavy cream for extra richness. Should you find yourself with extra pesto, drizzle it over steak, slather it on sandwiches or serve it alongside a cheese board or crudit\u00e9s.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/17/dining/aw-red-pesto-pasta/aw-red-pesto-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "food processor, orecchiette, parmesan, rigatoni, roasted red pepper, sun-dried tomato, tomato paste, walnut, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1797}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup drained jarred, oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes (about 3 1/2 ounces), roughly chopped", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts (a scant 2 1/2 ounces)", "3 tablespoons double-concentrated tomato paste (or 1/3 cup tomato paste)", "3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup drained chopped, jarred roasted red peppers (about 4 ounces)", "1 1/2 ounces finely grated Parmesan (about 1 packed cup), plus more for serving", "1 pound rigatoni, orecchiette or other shaped pasta", "Sliced fresh basil leaves, for serving", "Fresh lemon zest, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
