{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Vegetable Burritos", "description": "Roasted mushrooms, sweet potatoes and poblano chiles become a comforting vegetarian burrito filling in just 30 minutes. The meaty mushrooms and hearty potatoes give it substance, while roasted poblanos impart subtle smoky notes and mild heat. (Green bell peppers are a good nonspicy alternative.) The mashed avocado and sour cream lend creamy richness, while shredded lettuce and pico de gallo bring welcome crunch and freshness. Although not necessary, leftover rice is a nice addition to the burritos for an even more substantial meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/18/dining/kc-roasted-vegetable-burritos/merlin_195007404_58772053-74c0-4d6f-a986-f6ec17a1e7de-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "main course", "keywords": "burrito, mushroom, poblano, sweet potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1038}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces white, cremini or stuffing mushrooms, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "3 large poblano chiles (12 ounces), seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces\u00a0", "1 medium sweet potato (8 ounces), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup shredded Monterey Jack (4 ounces)", "1 Haas avocado, mashed with a fork", "4 (9- to 10-inch) flour tortillas", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1 packed cup shredded butter or bibb lettuce\u00a0", "1/2 cup pico de gallo or salsa, store-bought or homemade"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
