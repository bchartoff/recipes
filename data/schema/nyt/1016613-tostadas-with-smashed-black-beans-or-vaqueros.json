{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tostadas With Smashed Black Beans or Vaqueros", "description": "Refried heirloom vaquero beans add a special touch to these tostadas, but black beans work, too. I have always had a weakness for black bean tostadas. These are not unlike Oaxacan tlayudas, though this recipe doesn\u2019t call for that dish\u2019s signature extra-large corn tortillas. I used luxurious black and white vaqueros from Rancho Gordo for these, but black beans will also work well. Cook them yourself (don\u2019t use canned), because you\u2019ll need the delicious broth. I don\u2019t refry them for as long as I normally would because I like them moist, and vaqueros are starchier than black beans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/01/science/03recipehealth/03recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 tostadas, serving 4 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 181, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "25 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon grape seed oil or canola oil", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, ground", "4 cups simmered black beans or vaquero beans, with liquid", "8 corn tortillas", "3/4 pound ripe tomatoes, finely chopped", "1 to 2 serrano or jalape\u00f1o chiles (to taste), minced", "2 slices red or white onion, finely chopped and soaked for 5 minutes in water to cover, then drained, rinsed, and drained on paper towels", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro (more to taste)", "1 teaspoon fresh lime juice (optional)", "1 small ripe Hass avocado, cut in small dice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil over medium heat in a large, heavy pan (I use a heavy nonstick pan for this) and add cumin.
