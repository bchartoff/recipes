{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chamomile Tea Cake With Strawberry Icing", "description": "This buttery, chamomile tea-scented loaf is a sweet pop symphony, the Abba of cakes. A pot of flowery, just-brewed chamomile isn\u2019t required for drinking with slices of this tender loaf but is strongly recommended. In life and in food, you always need balance: A sip or two of the grassy, herbal tea between bites of this cake counters the sweetness, as do freeze-dried strawberries, which lend tartness and a naturally pink hue to the lemony glaze. This everyday loaf will keep on the counter for 3 to 4 days; be sure the cut side is always well wrapped.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/17/dining/17Mag-Eat1/17Mag-Eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "chamomile, freeze-dried strawberries, lemon, easter, mother\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 810}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons/6 grams chamomile tea (from 4 to 6 tea bags), crushed fine if coarse", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "2 large eggs", "1 large lemon", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/192 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/124 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 cup/8 grams freeze-dried strawberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
