And not much is dirtier, or more New York, than the house drink at Jane, a restaurant in the West Village -- the Dirty Jane. It's a pickled martini. Any questions?\n\nThe Dirty Jane is a gimmick, and it is also a great cocktail. Part martini, part deli sandwich, it is a vodka martini, no vermouth, with a wedge of pickled green tomato instead of an olive. A splash of the pickle brine makes it ''dirty,'' as a splash of olive brine would make it a straight ''dirty martini.'' The drink itself is a clear liquid.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "William L.
