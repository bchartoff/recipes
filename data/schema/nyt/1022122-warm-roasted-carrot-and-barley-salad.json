{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Warm Roasted Carrot and Barley Salad", "description": "There is something very exciting about transforming a simple bunch of carrots into a deeply flavorful and satisfying weeknight meal. Carrots are given a lot of love here: Leaving the skin on adds texture, slicing them into thin batons ensures that they cook quickly and evenly, and drizzling them with honey right out of the oven amplifies their natural sweetness. A sprinkle of lemon zest adds brightness. Ras el hanout, a North African spice blend, means \u201chead of the shop\u201d in Arabic as it was often one of the best mixes a vendor had to offer. Its fragrant blend of coriander, cumin, ginger, clove and turmeric brings warmth and richness to the tahini. The perfect chew of pearl barley is so gratifying in this dish, but for even more flavor, cook your barley in stock.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/16/dining/hm-roasted-carrots-with-tahini/merlin_185988006_0c9febda-4383-4dd3-978e-f22c0d309ac5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, grains and rice, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "almonds, carrot, honey, ras el hanout, tahini, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 669}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup pearled barley", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 pounds carrots, washed, trimmed and cut into 3-inch-long, a scant 1/2-inch-wide batons", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons runny honey, such as clover honey", "1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon zest (from 1/2 lemon)", "2 cups arugula", "A handful of parsley", "1/4 cup toasted sliced almonds", "1/4 cup tahini", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (from 1/2 lemon)", "1 teaspoon ras el hanout", "1 small garlic clove, grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees and place a rack on the lowest shelf.
