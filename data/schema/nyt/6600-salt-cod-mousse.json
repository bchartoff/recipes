For this, the cooked cod is best pounded with a big mortar and pestle to a very creamy consistency. For busy cooks, the recipe here calls for the job to be done in a food processor, but the texture is not quite the same. Purists willing to use a little muscle power will be rewarded with the best results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, extra virgin olive oil, fish, heavy cream, lemon, nutmeg, salted cod", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 396, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "3992 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound boneless salt cod, soaked overnight, drained and poached 15 minutes", "2 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste", "2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2/3 cup heavy cream or milk", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste", "Juice of 1 lemon, or to taste", "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "Salt, if necessary"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place half the cod in a food processor with garlic and 2 tablespoons olive oil.
