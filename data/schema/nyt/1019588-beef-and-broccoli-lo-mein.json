{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef and Broccoli Lo Mein", "description": "This takeout classic is beloved for a reason: It\u2019s mild, satisfying and dependable. The chewy noodles and tender beef make for a weeknight dinner that won\u2019t send you back to the fridge, snooping for a snack before bedtime. What makes this version better than the one from your neighborhood spot? A few things: It\u2019s fresher, hotter and arguably faster. In this version, smaller florets ensure that the beef and broccoli cook quickly, and are easily scooped up with chopsticks. The florets' size also lowers your chances of overcooking them before they're crisp and tender. To finish, add sesame oil, if you have it, but don\u2019t sweat it if you don\u2019t.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/dining/sc-beef-broccoli/sc-beef-broccoli-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, weeknight, noodles", "keywords": "beef, broccoli, lo mein, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 655}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 699, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1030 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (8-ounce) package lo mein noodles", "Salt", "3 garlic cloves, pressed or minced", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup dark\u00a0brown sugar", "2 tablespoons canola or grapeseed oil", "1 pound chuck or rib steak, thinly sliced against the grain", "1 (1-inch) piece of ginger, peeled and cut into rounds", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 head broccoli, cut into small florets (about 3 heaping cups)", "2 carrots, shredded", "3 scallions or green onions, thinly sliced", "2 to 3 teaspoons sesame oil (optional)", "1 lime, cut in wedges, for serving\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling, salted water until tender, about 4 minutes, or according to package instructions.\u00a0Drain and rinse under cold water.
