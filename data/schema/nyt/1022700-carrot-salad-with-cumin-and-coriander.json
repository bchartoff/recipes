{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carrot Salad With Cumin and Coriander", "description": "These lemony carrots taste lovely just as the recipe is written, perfumed with toasted cumin and coriander, a hint of garlic, and a touch of cayenne. This recipe draws its inspiration from Moroccan carrot salads, many of which use cooked vegetables, but this version uses slivered raw carrots instead. But if you want to splash out, try a pinch of cinnamon, and top with lots of fluffy chopped cilantro and thinly sliced jalape\u00f1o. Or add crumbled feta and olives. For the best-looking salad, use the julienne blade of a food processor, or cut the carrots into thin matchstick shapes with a sharp knife. The large holes of a box grater will work, too, but the result won\u2019t be quite as attractive. (But avoid those supermarket bags of pre-grated carrots. They\u2019re not suitable here.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/03/dining/29tanisrex1-carrot/merlin_196810872_8a091a11-025d-4ecd-b8ca-b54f5ddacf55-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "carrot, coriander, cumin, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 158}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound medium carrots, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks or grated", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)", "1 small garlic clove, grated", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground", "1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds, toasted and ground", "Pinch of ground cayenne", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons finely diced preserved lemon (optional)", "Whole mint leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put carrots in a medium bowl.
