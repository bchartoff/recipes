{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rustic Plum Crostata With Lemon Thyme", "description": "Whether you call it a crostata, a galette or a rustic fruit tart, this juicy, messy confection has a charm that lies with its flavors rather than its looks. It hits the same luscious, buttery, jammy notes as a fruit pie, but instead of being neatly trimmed, crimped and latticed, it features hasty folds and raggedy edges: perfectly acceptable points of style. Unlike jewel-like tarts crowned with perfect fruits, crostatas do just as well with weeping, bruised specimens, as long as you cut out any obviously funky bits. And crostatas are easy to improvise. You can use whatever fruit you have, making this a handy recipe to pull out when the result of your farmers\u2019 market shopping exuberance begins to wrinkle and fade.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/dining/plumcrostata/plumcrostata-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, flour, heavy cream, sugar plum", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 270, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "146 milligrams", "sugarContent": "21 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup (40 grams) whole-wheat flour", "1/2 cup (100 grams) plus 1 tablespoon (15 grams) sugar", "1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) plus a pinch fine sea salt", "1 large egg", "Heavy cream", "6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces", "3 cups sliced and pitted ripe sugar plums or mix of other plums about 1 1/2 pounds before pitting", "1 1/2 tablespoons (22 grams) cornstarch", "1 small bunch lemon thyme (or use 1 teaspoon lemon thyme leaves)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, pulse together the flours, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt until blended.
