{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Quinoa and Rice Bowl With Kale, Kimchi and Egg", "description": "Easy, healthful and infinitely adaptable, grain bowls are equally ideal for feeding a family (picky eaters can build it to suit their own tastes) and using up leftovers in the fridge. You could also cook up the ingredients at the beginning of the week, and mix and match ingredients at will as the week progresses. Try rice, quinoa, kamut, farro, freekeh, wheat berries, barley and grits for the grain (this recipe calls for mixing brown rice and quinoa for a nice variety of textures, but feel free to use just one or the other). Put your grains in a large bowl, then arrange small piles of vegetables, protein and something pickled or spicy over the grains. Top with a sauce that brings together all the ingredients in the bowl. Crunch \u2014 here, sesame seed and dried seaweed \u2014 is a nice finishing touch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/01/multimedia/clark-grain-bowls/clark-grain-bowls-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "avocado, brown rice, egg, kale, kimchi, quinoa, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 808}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 546, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "658 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt, as needed", "2/3 cup brown rice", "2/3 cup uncooked red or white quinoa, well rinsed", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "4 teaspoons finely chopped peeled ginger", "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar", "1/4 cup peanut oil", "1 teaspoon sesame oil", "1 8-ounce bunch kale, thick ribs removed, leaves torn into large pieces", "4 large eggs", "1 avocado, peeled, pitted and sliced", "1 cup coarsely chopped kimchi, or to taste", "Sliced scallions, for serving", "Sesame seeds, for serving", "Crumbled dried seaweed snack sheets, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil and add rice.
