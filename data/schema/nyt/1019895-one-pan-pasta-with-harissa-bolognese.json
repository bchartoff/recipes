{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pan Pasta With Harissa Bolognese", "description": "This Bolognese is made from start to finish in one roasting pan \u2014 including the pasta, which cooks directly in the sauce. It may seem counterintuitive to chop apart dried manicotti or cannelloni, but there is a method to the madness: It\u2019s nearly impossible to break the dried pasta in half exactly, so you end up with some shards, which become lovely and crisp, and some tubes, which hold the sauce very nicely. The kick and thick consistency of the Tunisian harissa brand Le Phare du Cap Bon is especially nice, but any kind will work \u2014 just note that the spice level and texture of the final dish will reflect the harissa you choose. Sprinkle this dish with additional cheese before serving, if you\u2019d like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/dining/30ottorex2/merlin_149515008_1db28e3f-49cb-4715-bcd1-fb0793b4ae46-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, pastas", "keywords": "fall, winter, ground beef, ground pork, harissa, pasta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 543}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1043, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "71 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "56 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "sodiumContent": "1183 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds/680 grams ground beef (beef mince), at least 15 percent fat", "1 pound/450 grams ground pork (pork mince)", "1/3 cup/90 grams tomato paste", "1/4 cup/70 grams harissa paste", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters olive oil", "2 ounces/60 grams Parmesan, finely grated (about 1 cup)", "2 ounces/60 grams Pecorino Romano, finely grated (about 1 cup)", "Salt and black pepper", "1 carrot, peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced", "1 small onion, peeled and roughly chopped", "2 large plum tomatoes, roughly chopped", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped", "3 cups/750 milliliters chicken stock", "1/2 cup/100 milliliters heavy cream (double cream)", "1 (8-ounce/225-gram) package dried manicotti or cannelloni, pasta roughly chopped in half crosswise", "1/4 packed cup/10 grams roughly chopped parsley, plus extra for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit/245 degrees Celsius.
