{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basic Sticky Rice", "description": "Also known as \u201csweet rice\u201d or glutinous rice (though it\u2019s gluten free), sticky rice is a large white grain that becomes translucent, shiny and extremely sticky when steamed. Sticky rice is a staple in Laos, where it is especially beloved, but it has ardent fans throughout Asia. Traditionally, it\u2019s cooked over steam in a conical woven basket. If you don\u2019t have such a steamer, you can use a standard stacking steamer, a colander lined with muslin or cheesecloth, or a fine mesh strainer that fits over a saucepan. For the best texture, cooking sticky rice over hot steam is ideal, but it is possible to pull it off in an electric rice cooker, using less water than usual, or in a pot on the stove. What follows are the basic instructions for success.\n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/17/dining/stickyrice/stickyrice-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "side dish, sweet rice, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 77}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "0 milligrams", "sugarContent": null, "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup glutinous (sweet) rice, preferably long-grain"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put rice in a bowl and rinse several times in cold water until water is clear, not milky, then drain.
