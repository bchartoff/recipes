{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Delicata Squash and Corn Fritters", "description": "These vegetable-packed fritters are crispy around the edges and tender in the center. Delicata squash has a thin skin that can be left on, adding color and a dose of nuttiness. Corn adds pops of sweetness, while moist zucchini helps bind the patties. Fragrant fried sage leaves do double duty in this dish: First they infuse the oil with herbaceous flavor, then they become a beautiful, crisp garnish. For the best results, fry the fritters and serve immediately; however, they can also be made a few hours ahead and reheated at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes until hot and crisp.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/15/dining/kc-delicata-squash-and-corn-fritters/merlin_197339925_0a5ac08d-d4c0-49ee-a99a-40628e37bf43-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "16 fritters", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "corn, delicata squash, scallion, zucchini, fall, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 381}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup safflower or canola oil", "16 large sage leaves", "4 ounces zucchini (1 small)", "1 pound delicata squash (about 1 large), scrubbed, halved lengthwise and seeded (skin left on)", "1 cup fresh corn kernels (from 1 to 2 ears), or thawed from frozen", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions (from 2 to 3 scallions)", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 large egg, beaten", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup (105 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a plate with a paper towel.
