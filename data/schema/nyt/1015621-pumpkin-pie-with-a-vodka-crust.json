{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Pie With a Vodka Crust", "description": "This recipe made waves among home bakers when it was published by Cook's Illustrated magazine in 2008 because of its brilliant use of vodka in the dough, which all but ensures that the baked crust is tender. The vodka, which evaporates in the hot oven, is essential here, and you shouldn't taste it in the finished crust, so do not skip it. The filling is delicious too, pillowy with a deep, rich flavor. Cook's Illustrated advised readers to add the filling to the prebaked crust when both the crust and the filling are still warm; it helps ensure accurate cooking times and a crisp crust.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Weinstein"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/Pumpkin-Pie/Pumpkin-Pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, yams, pie, pumpkin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 143}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 517, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "495 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (6 1/4 ounces)", "1/2 teaspoon table salt", "1 tablespoon sugar", "6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) cold unsalted butter , cut into 1/4-inch slices", "1/4 cup vegetable shortening, cold, cut into two pieces", "2 tablespoons vodka, cold", "2 tablespoons cold water", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 cup whole milk", "3 large eggs plus 2 large yolks", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree", "1 cup drained candied yams from 15-ounce can (or use regular canned yams)", "3/4 cup sugar", "1/4 cup maple syrup", "2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 teaspoon table salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the crust:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Process 3/4 cup flour, salt, and sugar in food processor until combined, about two 1-second pulses.
