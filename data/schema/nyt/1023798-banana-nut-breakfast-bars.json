{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banana Nut Breakfast Bars", "description": "These bars get their fudgy texture from ripe bananas and are lightly sweetened with honey. They are packed with nut butter, walnuts and oats, making them a satisfying breakfast treat. By combining the mashed bananas with eggs and letting them sit together for 15 minutes, the bananas become extra sweet. That\u2019s because eggs contain a starch-digesting enzyme called amylase, which converts some of the banana starches to sugar. Best of all? The batter comes together quickly, in just one bowl.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sohla El-Waylly"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/13/multimedia/SE-banana-nut-breakfast-bars-gwjp/SE-banana-nut-breakfast-bars-gwjp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "9 bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, snack", "keywords": "almond butter, banana, bar cookie, make-ahead, one bowl, peanut butter, rolled oat, walnut, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 754}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ripe medium bananas (about 240 grams peeled)", "2 large eggs", "6 tablespoons/90 milliliters olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan", "3/4 cup/187 grams peanut or almond butter", "6 tablespoons/120 grams honey", "2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), or 1 teaspoon fine salt", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1 cup/100 grams old-fashioned rolled oats", "3/4 cup/80 grams walnut halves and pieces, roughly chopped", "Flaky salt, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, use a fork to mash the bananas; you should get about 1 cup mashed bananas.
