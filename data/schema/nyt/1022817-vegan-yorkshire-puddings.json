Vegan cooks use neither, so this savory recipe is a particularly impressive workaround by Mary McCartney, who stopped eating meat in in the late 1970s when her parents, Sir Paul and Linda, became vegetarians and activists. The structure here comes from protein-rich chickpea flour and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/dining/aquafaba-vegan-egg-substitute.html\">aquafaba</a>, Italian for \u201cchickpea water,\u201d and the rise from baking powder and cider vinegar.  The recipe needs to be followed closely for best results, particularly the oven temperature, the material and size of the muffin tin (metal and standard 3-ounce cups) and the amount of oil in each cup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/22/dining/17Puddingrex/17Puddingrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "9 popovers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 253}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (15-ounce/425-gram) can chickpeas", "1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar", "3/4 cup/90 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/85 grams chickpea flour (garam flour)", "3 1/4 teaspoons/13 grams baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "Vegetable oil, such as grape seed or canola, for the muffin tin"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain the chickpeas, reserving 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon/140 grams aquafaba (chickpea liquid).
