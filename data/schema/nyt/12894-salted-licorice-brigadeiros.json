{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salted Licorice Brigadeiros", "description": "Luscious Brazilian-style fudge balls coated thickly with chocolate sprinkles get an upgrade in this marvelous recipe from Melissa Clark that brings salted licorice into the mix to create something that looks a lot like chocolate truffles but tastes even more divine: creamy, smooth and just salty enough, while still remaining firmly planted on the sweet side of the equation. Added bonus: They are extremely easy to throw together, an excellent candy-making project for families or those in search of fast-and-delicious treats.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/17/dining/recipes-licoricebrigadeiros/recipes-licoricebrigadeiros-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "About 3 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "brazilian", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "chocolate, licorice, dessert, fall, winter, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 36}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 box (7 ounces) soft black licorice", "1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "1 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped", "Chocolate sprinkles", "Coarse sea salt, like fleur de sel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, grind licorice until finely chopped, about 30 seconds (it will be noisy).
