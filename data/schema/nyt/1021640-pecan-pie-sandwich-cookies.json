{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pecan Pie Sandwich Cookies", "description": "These portable takes on pie are for nut lovers. The rich crunch of toasted pecans runs through them, from the brown sugar shortbread to the tender praline center. Ground nuts make the cookies both crumbly and crisp. More pecans are packed into the filling, which combines a deep sweetness with the texture of a soft caramel. A candy thermometer helps ensure the filling doesn\u2019t end up saucy or chewy; it runs like lava during assembly, then sets as it cools. You can skip the filling for a batch of buttery cookies, or make it on its own to use as an ice cream topping. The assembled cookies keep at room temperature in an airtight container for up to five days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/13/dining/13BAKING-3/13BAKING-3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "20 to 24 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "butter, cookie, dark corn syrup, flour, pecans, fall, winter, kentucky derby, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 755}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/150 grams pecan halves, toasted", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1/3 cup/40 grams packed confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/3 cup/75 grams packed light brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large egg yolk", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick)", "1 cup/220 grams packed light brown sugar", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters dark corn syrup", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 tablespoon bourbon or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 3/4 cups/175 grams pecan halves, toasted and finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cookies: Combine the pecans and 1/2 cup/65 grams flour in a food processor or blender and pulse until the pecans are coarsely ground with pebbly bits remaining."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, both sugars and salt on low speed until creamy and smooth.
