{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salsa Tatemada Norte\u00f1a (Fire-Roasted Salsa)", "description": "Every region of Mexico has its way of making a chunky, fire-roasted salsa, with the classic tomato, onion and chile trio; it goes by tatemada, if charred, or martajada, if mashed. With only three ingredients, regional variations taste radically different based on the chile of choice, which becomes the soul of the salsa, defining its personality. In the Yucatan, the feisty habanero rules, but in Mexico\u2019s north (as well as Arizona and New Mexico), the king is Anaheim chile, whose crisp bite and mild, peppery taste embody this salsa tatemada norte\u00f1a, a favorite for carne asada cookouts. The secret to making this salsa shine is to be generous with the salt; the charred juicy ingredients will appreciate it. Dip your chips in it, top your quesadillas with it or ladle it on sunny-side-up eggs sitting on refried beans for a northern style variation of huevos rancheros.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10Carneasadarex3-salsa/merlin_175265259_f88b904d-4584-4203-8678-d9483d460d3e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups (6 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "condiments, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "anaheim chiles, onion, tomato, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 271}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ripe Roma tomatoes", "1/2 pound whole, fresh Anaheim chiles (2 to 3 large chiles); see Note", "1/4 peeled large white onion (about 3 ounces)", "1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start a charcoal or prepare a gas grill.
