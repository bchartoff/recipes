This recipe, adapted from Grace Young's book, \"The Breath of a Wok,\" ran alongside it. It is simple, fresh and fast. It cooks in under 5 minutes, so start your pot of rice as you clean the shrimp and chop the ginger, garlic and scallions.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/22/dining/22COOKING-FRIEDSHRIMP1/22COOKING-FRIEDSHRIMP1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "ginger, rice wine, seafood, shrimp, snow peas, low calorie, low-fat, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 324}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "783 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined", "1/3 cup chicken broth", "2 teaspoons rice wine or dry sherry", "1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch", "3/4 teaspoon sugar", "1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 teaspoon minced ginger", "6 ounces snow peas, strings removed, washed and dried", "1 scallion, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl combine 2 cups cold water and 1 tablespoon salt, stirring until salt is dissolved.
