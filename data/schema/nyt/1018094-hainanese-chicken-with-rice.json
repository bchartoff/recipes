If you do this repeatedly, the stock will become stronger and stronger, as will the flavors of both chicken and rice. If you do this hundreds of times, the way restaurants do, the flavors will be quite intense. But even if you do it once, the dish is a total winner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/09/12/dining/hainanese-chicken/hainanese-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "chicken, garlic, rice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 248}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 661, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "978 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 whole (3- to 4-pound) chicken, trimmed of excess fat", "Several cloves smashed garlic, plus 1 teaspoon minced garlic", "Several slices fresh ginger, plus 1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1/2 cup peanut oil, or neutral oil, like corn or canola", "3 shallots, roughly chopped, or a small onion", "2 cups long-grain rice", "1/2 cup minced scallions", "2 cucumbers, peeled and sliced", "2 tomatoes, sliced", "Chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "2 tablespoons sesame oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it.
