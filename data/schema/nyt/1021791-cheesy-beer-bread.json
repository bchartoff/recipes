{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Beer Bread", "description": "This easy bread recipe uses beer and baking powder to leaven instead of yeast, producing a loaf with a lightly crisp crust and a beautifully soft interior. A strongly flavored cheese, like sharp Cheddar or Gruy\u00e8re, complements the flavors of the beer. The brown sugar isn\u2019t absolutely necessary, but it extends the bread\u2019s shelf life, keeping the interior soft even after it\u2019s been sliced. This bread is especially lovely served warm, but is also delicious at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/12/dining/ejm-cheesy-beer-bread/ejm-cheesy-beer-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-5-inch loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, breads, side dish", "keywords": "beer, cheddar, cheese, flour, fontina, gruy\u00e8re", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 337}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick spray", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons light or dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "5 tablespoons/70 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, plus 1/4 cup/55 grams melted unsalted butter, for finishing", "1 (12-ounce/355-milliliter) bottle beer (1 1/2 cups), preferably a lager or ale", "1 1/4 cups/140 grams shredded firm or semi-firm cheese, such as sharp Cheddar, Gruy\u00e8re or fontina"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
