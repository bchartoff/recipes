{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta e Patate (Pasta and Potato Soup)", "description": "Pasta e patate is a fortifying, soothing Italian soup made for blustery days. The starchy combination of pasta and potatoes makes for a rich and satisfying broth. Avoid the temptation to use chicken or vegetable broth instead of water, and be assured that the pancetta, Parmesan rind, olive oil and starchy potatoes all add ample flavor and body to the humble soup. (In southern Italy, tomatoes are also added for a red version of the dish.) If you use bacon instead of the pancetta, be mindful that the results will be smokier and saltier.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/20/dining/nd-pasta-e-patate/merlin_213671247_9054a84c-236d-4474-852b-62daf7ea4ae0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "bacon, one pot, pancetta, parmesan, soup, spaghetti, yukon gold potato, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 357}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 large carrot, scrubbed and finely chopped", "1 large celery stalk, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 ounces finely chopped pancetta or bacon (about 1/2 cup)", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 1/4 pounds), peeled and chopped into 1-inch pieces", "1 rosemary sprig", "1 (2-inch) piece Parmesan rind", "6 ounces spaghetti (a little more than 1/4 of a box), broken into fourths", "Grated Parmesan or pecorino, to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat the oil over medium.
