{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp Cocktail", "description": "This method for a beloved appetizer maximizes flavor by gently poaching shrimp in a deeply seasoned broth of salt, chile powder and celery seeds. Rather than wash away all the spices with a rinse or a plunge in an ice bath, you stop the cooking by pouring ice directly into the hot bath. For dipping, go for a classic cocktail sauce with the sharp brightness of lemon and horseradish, or a simple garlicky dill butter, which makes the shrimp taste somehow of lobster, or a comforting, warmly spiced honey mustard, because you always need a creamy option. Enjoy the plump shrimp with your favorite sauce \u2014 or all three.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/29/dining/23shrimprex/23shrimprex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, seafood, appetizer", "keywords": "butter, ketchup, shrimp, christmas, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 498}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds large (21- to 25-count) shrimp, shelled and deveined", "Kosher salt", "8 cups ice cubes (about 2 pounds), plus more for serving", "1/4 cup mild red chile powder, gochugaru or sweet paprika with a dash of ground cayenne", "1 tablespoon celery seeds", "2 lemons", "1/2 cup ketchup", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "2 tablespoons prepared horseradish", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Tabasco sauce", "1/2 cup unsalted butter", "2 large garlic cloves, finely grated", "1/4 packed cup finely chopped fresh dill (from 1 small bunch)", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons honey", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the shrimp: In a large bowl, toss together the shrimp and 2 teaspoons salt, and set aside.
