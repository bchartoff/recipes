{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orange Marmalade Cake", "description": "This beautiful, tender, citrus-scented loaf cake filled with bits of candied orange peel is everything you want with your afternoon tea. The key is finding the right marmalade; it needs to be the thick-cut (also known as coarse-cut) marmalade made with bitter oranges, which will be laden with big pieces of peel. Look for the British brands in the international section of your supermarket if the jam aisle lets you down. (And not give up and use the neon orange marmalade that's more like jelly.) Your reward is a fine-grained, not-too-sweet cake that will last for days well-wrapped and stored at room temperature (if you can manage not to eat it up all at once).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/14/multimedia/clark-marmalade-cake/clark-marmalade-cake-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, fresh orange juice, marmalade", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 624}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 427, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "277 milligrams", "sugarContent": "39 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["215 grams coarse-cut orange marmalade (2/3 cup), divided", "12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus 1/2 tablespoon for glaze, and more for greasing pan", "150 grams granulated sugar (3/4 cup)", "2 teaspoons grated lime zest", "1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons fresh orange juice", "190 grams all-purpose flour (1 1/2 cups)", "7 grams baking powder (1 1/2 teaspoons)", "3 grams fine sea salt (3/4 teaspoon)", "30 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar (4 tablespoons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
