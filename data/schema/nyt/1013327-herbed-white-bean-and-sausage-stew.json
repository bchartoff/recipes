It is deeply flavored and complex, but quite easy to make. Pan-fry the sausages in a bit of olive oil, then saut\u00e9 the vegetables with cumin and tomato paste in the drippings. Add plenty of water and the dried beans that, wait for it, you did not have to soak. Simmer until the house is fragrant and the windows fog up (about 2 hours).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/dining/mc-white-bean-stew/mc-white-bean-stew-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course, sausage, white beans", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2201}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 200, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "569 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 pound sweet Italian sausage, sliced 3/4-inch thick", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 medium carrots, finely diced", "2 celery stalks, finely diced", "1 onion, chopped", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 pound dried great Northern beans, rinsed and picked through", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste", "2 thyme sprigs", "1 large rosemary sprig", "1 bay leaf", "2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, plus more for serving", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high.
