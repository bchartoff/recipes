{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blackberry-Peach Cobbler", "description": "Peak summer fruit is best prepared simply, especially in warm desserts like cobblers. In this recipe, the tartness of blackberries (or raspberries) balances the sweetness of yellow peaches (or nectarines), and the filling only needs the tiniest amount of sugar to get the juices flowing. Topped with a thin layer of fluffy cornmeal batter, the berries boil up to form juicy pockets, and a finish of raw sugar adds a satisfying crack. Serve this cobbler warm, or enjoy it any time of day, even for breakfast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Laurie Ellen Pellicano"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/lep-blackberry-peach-cobbler/merlin_188069013_64b9bca0-c534-4544-ab2c-9a2f29a6fdc4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "1 (10-inch) skillet cobbler (8 to 10 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "blackberries, cornmeal, peach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 450}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds ripe yellow peaches (or nectarines), pitted and chopped into 1-inch chunks", "1 pint/6 ounces blackberries (or raspberries)", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon tapioca starch or cornstarch", "1 lemon, halved, zest reserved for cobbler topping", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "1 large egg", "3/4 cup/114 grams fine-grind cornmeal", "3/4 cup/96 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "4 tablespoons/57 grams cold unsalted butter (1/2 stick), cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 tablespoon turbinado, or any raw sugar, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
