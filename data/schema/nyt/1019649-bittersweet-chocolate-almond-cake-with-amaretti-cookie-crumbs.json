{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bittersweet Chocolate-Almond Cake With Amaretti Cookie Crumbs", "description": "Here\u2019s a cake that comes together with the push of a button \u2014 butter, sugar, eggs and cocoa as well as dark chocolate, almonds and amaretti cookies are blended in a food processor. Although it looks like a brownie, the cake tilts toward a nut torte. It\u2019s low and sleek, simple, sophisticated and packed with flavor. The original recipe appeared in my debut cookbook, \u201cSweet Times,\u201d in 1991, and when I made it for Julia Child that year, I got her thumbs up. Over time, I haven\u2019t fiddled much with the recipe\u2019s basics, but these days I finish the cake with a glaze and a sprinkling of crushed amaretti for style and crunch. I prefer amaretti di Saronno by Lazzaroni for the cake, but other amaretti work well too. And don\u2019t be distressed if the cake develops a mound during baking (it happens now and then). Press it down with a spatula \u2014 it doesn\u2019t diminish this cake\u2019s deliciousness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/14/magazine/14mag-OnDessert-image1/14mag-OnDessert-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H55M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "almonds, amaretti cookies, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder, sea salt, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 361}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 406, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "155 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 stick (113 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for dusting the pan", "3/4 cup (75 grams) sliced or slivered almonds", "6 double amaretti cookies (about 72 grams), such as Lazzaroni brand", "1/3 cup (67 grams) sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "4 ounces (113 grams) bittersweet chocolate, melted (it can still be warm)", "2 ounces (57 grams) bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped", "1/4 cup (60 ml) heavy cream", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 tablespoon water", "2 double amaretti cookies (about 24 grams), crushed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and preheat to 350.
