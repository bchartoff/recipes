{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blistered Shishito Peppers", "description": "This appetizer served in Japanese bars, American steakhouses and everywhere in between is finger food at its best. The charred, sweet peppers have a built-in handle, and they really don\u2019t need more than flaky salt for seasoning. That said, you could garnish further with lemon or lime zest, gomasio, bonito flakes, grated cheese, smoked paprika, sumac and so on. You can also cook Padr\u00f3n peppers using the same method. They have a slightly different shape, but are similarly thin-skinned and mild. One warning, though: Each batch of shishito and Padr\u00f3n peppers have a handful of surprisingly hot peppers that look identical to the tame ones, so proceed with caution.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/14/dining/AS-Blistered-Shishito-Peppers/merlin_194303340_426cd5e7-3593-46ee-8058-9da77a16d0df-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, vegetables, appetizer", "keywords": "olive oil, shishito", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 579}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces shishito peppers", "1 tablespoon neutral oil (such as vegetable or grapeseed)", "Flaky salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, toss the peppers with the oil.
