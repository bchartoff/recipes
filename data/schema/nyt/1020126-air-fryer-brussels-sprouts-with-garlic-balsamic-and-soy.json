Here they are paired with slivers of garlic, which turn into pungent golden chips as they fry. Then the whole thing is dressed with a mix of balsamic vinegar that\u2019s been simmered until thickened, then seasoned with lime juice for freshness and soy sauce for complexity. Serve this as a side dish, or as snack with drinks; just make sure to have plenty of napkins on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/dining/03airrex3/02airrex3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, balsamic vinegar, brussels sprouts, garlic, soy sauce, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 200}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 155, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "186 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved through the stems (cut larger ones in quarters)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup balsamic vinegar", "1 teaspoon fresh lime juice, plus more for serving", "1/2 teaspoon soy sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat air fryer to 400 degrees, if preheating is necessary."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place brussels sprouts in the air fryer basket; drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and the salt.
