{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Breast With Stuffing", "description": "Turkey breast can be seasoned all sorts of ways and served with various <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/279810-thanksgiving-stuffing-and-dressing\">stuffings</a>. I cook the stuffing separately, which lets me monitor the breast's doneness more precisely. When a meat thermometer in the center of the breast reaches 160 degrees, it is done. Let it rest, covered, 10 minutes or so before carving.
