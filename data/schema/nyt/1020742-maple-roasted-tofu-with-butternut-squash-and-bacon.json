{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple-Roasted Tofu With Butternut Squash and Bacon", "description": "A small amount of bacon adds a lot of smoky flavor to sweet maple-roasted vegetables and glazed tofu. It\u2019s a colorful, cozy sheet-pan meal for tofu lovers who also eat meat, or bacon eaters who are trying to eat less meat. To make this dish vegan, skip the bacon, and add 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika to the maple syrup mixture. Dicing the squash into small cubes helps it roast at the same rate as the brussels sprouts, so be sure to keep the pieces around 1/2 inch in size.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/dining/31lessmeat5/merlin_166281756_b48cdffd-e37c-430e-839a-edfb9bbe70c3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "bacon, brussels sprouts, extra-firm tofu, fish sauce, squash, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 271}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14- to 16-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and patted dry", "1/4 cup maple syrup", "2 teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "12 ounces butternut squash (1 small to medium squash), peeled, trimmed, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed, small ones left whole, large ones halved", "1 medium red onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage leaves", "2 ounces bacon, diced into 1-inch pieces", "1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce", "3 teaspoons fresh lime juice, plus more for drizzling", "1 teaspoon Asian fish sauce", "1/2 cup sliced scallions (white and green parts), for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
