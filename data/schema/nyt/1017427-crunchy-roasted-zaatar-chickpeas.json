{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy Roasted Za\u2019atar Chickpeas", "description": "Za\u2019atar, a Middle Eastern spice mix made from dried thyme, sumac, and sesame seeds, gives these roasted chickpeas a fragrant, herbal, tangy bite. Unlike other similar recipes, the chickpeas are roasted without any oil, which is added after they come out of the oven. This allows the peas to crisp up without turning greasy. Do make sure to dry them out for an hour as directed, which adds to their crunchy texture. It\u2019s hard to stop eating these once you start, so if you\u2019re serving these to a group, consider making a double batch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/27/dining/27COOKBOOK1/27COOKBOOK1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods", "keywords": "chickpea, za\u2019atar, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1010}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 113, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "144 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups cooked chickpeas, rinsed if canned", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons za\u2019atar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Spread out chickpeas on a paper towel.
