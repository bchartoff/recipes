{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Mint and Parmesan", "description": "The pairing of pasta with mint and Parmesan is a good one. There is something about the lightly assaultive yet somehow sweet nature of mint that is unlike any other herb. Older cuisines use it occasionally, but it is rarely seen as a major player. In this dish, however, softened by butter and cheese, mint converts a basic but undeniably heavy combination into an easy yet complex pasta dish best described as refreshing. \n\nTo the inevitable question, Can I use olive oil instead of butter? my answer is that you can, but you will completely change the nature of the dish; it won't be bad, but it won't be as good. Better, I think, to cut the butter back to two tablespoons. But because this sauce is cut with the pasta cooking water, the butter is spread nicely throughout, and it really isn't a huge amount per person.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/19/dining/19COOKING-MINTPARMESEANPASTA2/19COOKING-MINTPARMESEANPASTA2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, pastas", "keywords": "main course, side dish, mint, parmesan, pasta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 615}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 640, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "87 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "401 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 pound cut pasta, like ziti or penne, or long pasta, like linguine or spaghetti", "1/2 stick butter (4 tablespoons), cut into pieces", "1/2 cup chopped mint leaves", "1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it.
