{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Corn and Tomato Salsa", "description": "Grilling tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os and corn makes for a nice mix of flavors. The sweetness of the corn contrasts well with the charred and picante flavors of the salsa. I\u2019ve added corn to salsa fresca before, but this time, eyeing generous ears of corn on the cob in the market, I imagined it grilled or roasted in a roasted tomato salsa. I used as a starting point the renowned chef Rick Bayless\u2019s terrific roasted jalape\u00f1o tomato salsa with fresh cilantro, from a book he published in 1998 called \u201cSalsas That Cook.\u201d After I had grilled the tomatoes and jalape\u00f1o under a broiler (you could also cook them on a grill), I grilled an ear of corn, also under a broiler. The kernels take on a beautiful color, and their sweetness contrasts nicely with the charred and picante flavors that run through this salsa. The corn also contributes crunch. The salsa is great with tacos, chips, and grains, and is particularly good with chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/29/science/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Makes a little about 2 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low calorie, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 40}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 293, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "2132 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes, preferably plum tomatoes", "1 or 2 jalape\u00f1os (about 1 ounce)", "1 ear of corn, shucked", "1/2 small white onion, sliced about 1/4 inch thick (about 2 ounces)", "4 garlic cloves, peeled", "Salt to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar", "1/4 cup water (optional)", "1/3 to 1/2 cup chopped cilantro (to taste)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat broiler and set rack 4 inches below.
