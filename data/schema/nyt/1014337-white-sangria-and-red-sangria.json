They can be called on for many occasions, and are the ideal finishing touch for sangria, either red or white.

Both are more refreshing than sweet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/applespearslimes/applespearslimes-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "fruit, gin, wine, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 95}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 482, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "18 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 apples, cored and coarsely diced", "2 pears, cored and coarsely diced", "2 juice oranges, peeled, seeded and diced", "1 cup gin", "1/2 cup triple sec", "3 bottles (500 milliliters each) manzanilla sherry or 2 bottles 750 milliliters each dry white wine", "1/2 bottle cava 1 1/2 cups, chilled", "1 bottle red wine, preferably garnacha", "Juice of 1 1/2 oranges", "Juice of 1 lemon", "Juice of 1 lime", "1/2 cup Spanish brandy", "1/4 cup triple sec", "1 apple, cored and sliced", "1 pear, cored and sliced", "1 cinnamon stick", "1/2 bottle cava 1 1/2 cups, chilled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all fruit in a bowl with gin and triple sec.
