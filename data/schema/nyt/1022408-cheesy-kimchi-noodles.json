{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheesy Kimchi Noodles", "description": "Instant ramen ranks highly among comfort foods because it can be quickly prepared and those little seasoning packets provide lots of flavor with minimal effort. No packets are used in this recipe, but the addition of gooey, melted Cheddar and funky fermented kimchi makes the dish even more satisfying. Saut\u00e9ed scallions and garlic balance out the spicy Sriracha, soy and sesame sauce, while the runny yolk from a crispy fried egg adds richness and mellows the spice. The cheese becomes sticky as it cools, so these noodles are best served immediately while still warm and glossy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lara Lee"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/24/dining/ll-kimchi-cheese-noodles/merlin_191247378_73fcd1e9-9050-4c20-9dd1-ccd24f914d76-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, noodles, main course", "keywords": "cheese, kimchi", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1191}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces dried instant noodles (see Tip)", "1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for coating cooked noodles", "2 eggs", "5 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal (reserve 1 tablespoon for garnish)", "1/2 (packed) cup kimchi, sliced", "3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped", "1 tablespoon black (or white) sesame seeds, plus more for garnish", "1/2 cup grated Cheddar", "2 tablespoons Sriracha", "1 to 2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over high.
