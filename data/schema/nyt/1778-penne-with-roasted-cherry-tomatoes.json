{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Penne With Roasted Cherry Tomatoes", "description": "This exquisitely simple recipe came to The Times in a 2001 article about Paola di Mauro, an Italian winemaker in Marina, a small town southeast of Rome. She was one of a band of cooks who helped distinguish  \"cucina casalinga,\" roughly translated as \"housewives' cooking.\" From her humble kitchen, Ms. di Mauro mentored some of the best Italian chefs and restaurateurs in the United States, including Mario Batali, Lidia Bastianich, Piero Selvaggio and Tony May. Her recipe is easy and calls for just five ingredients \u2013 cherry tomatoes, olive oil, pecorino romano and penne pasta \u2013 but get your hands on the best ingredients you can afford. Ms. di Mauro intended this to serve four as a first course, but if you're making this for dinner, double the recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/16/dining/16COOKING-PENNY-TOMATOES2/16COOKING-PENNY-TOMATOES2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, penne, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 895}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 525, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "52 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "493 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound small cherry tomatoes, halved", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus 2 to 3 tablespoons for tossing", "Sea salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup freshly grated pecorino romano, more for serving", "1/4 cup bread crumbs", "1/2 pound penne"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
