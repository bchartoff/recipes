{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro and Lentils With Jammy Onions", "description": "Simmering chopped onions in a generous amount of olive oil is a two-for-one deal: The onions go soft and sweet while the oil gets infused with deep flavor. While the onions sizzle and simmer, the lentils and farro boil together until al dente, keeping the dish a speedy weeknight option. This makes a great warm side dish or a satisfying make-ahead grain salad. (Leftovers keep for up to three days.) Red-pepper flakes add heat, and lemon peel provides floral sweetness; you could also add whole spices, capers or other additions, if you like. Accessorize with hearty greens, soft herbs, eggs, smoked fish or leftover roasted vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/04/dining/as-lentils-and-farro/merlin_182183358_1f7aec14-7cb3-4eff-bf07-003b1728f86a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, beans, grains and rice, main course, side dish", "keywords": "farro, lemon, lentils, onion, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1388}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "2/3 cup olive oil", "2 large yellow onions, coarsely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup brown or green lentils", "1 cup farro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil.
