A combination of chilies and sage add a spicy, earthy note, and a glaze of tomato paste and olive oil elevates a traditional dish away from its ketchup roots. The pine nuts are a visual cue: this is something a little different. And it tastes great the day after.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/spicygarlicmeatloaf/spicygarlicmeatloaf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday", "keywords": "beef, pork, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 389}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 393, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "383 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large eggs, lightly beaten", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "3 scallions, white and light green parts, finely chopped", "1 medium jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded and finely chopped", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup dried bread crumbs", "3 tablespoons chicken stock, heavy cream or milk", "1 pound ground pork", "1 pound ground beef", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons pine nuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
