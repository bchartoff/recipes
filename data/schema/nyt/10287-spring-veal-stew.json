Much of the flavor comes from browning the veal cubes, but be careful: veal is pretty lean, so it doesn\u2019t take long to dry out. Stewing it for 15 to 20 minutes (sometimes even less) with a little splash of white wine is all it takes. Add the peas at the end, and cook until they\u2019re tender and warm \u2014 you don\u2019t want to cook all the flavor out of them, especially if they\u2019re fresh.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/vealstew/vealstew-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 85}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 434, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "895 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon butter", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds veal cubes, no side larger than 1 1/2 inches", "1 sprig fresh tarragon, or 1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon", "1 pound spring onions or shallots, peeled (if large, trimmed and halved), or scallions, each cut in 2 or 3 pieces", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup white wine or water", "1 cup fresh shelled peas, snow peas or frozen peas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a 12-inch skillet over high heat, and a minute later add oil and butter.
