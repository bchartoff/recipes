{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp in Yellow Curry", "description": "Many Thai dishes are not unlike what we call curries, but although they may contain curry powder, they are more often based on a combination of herbs and aromatic vegetables, rather than dried spices. A typical curry might feature a mixture of garlic, shallots, chiles, lime leaf, sugar and galangal (or ginger). This simplified version leaves out the lime leaf and sugar, but benefits from the addition of a couple spoonfuls of fish sauce at the end of cooking. It is brightly flavored, but blessedly easy to toss together on a weeknight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/17/dining/17COOKING-CURRIEDSHRIMP1/17COOKING-CURRIEDSHRIMP1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "chili, cilantro leaves, coconut milk, curry powder, galangal, garlic, nam pla, onion, peanut oil, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1262}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 348, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1856 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil", "1 cup minced onion", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced galangal or ginger", "1 teaspoon minced hot chili, or crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste", "1 tablespoon curry powder, or to taste", "1 cup fresh or canned coconut milk", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds medium-to-large shrimp, peeled", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons nam pla (fish sauce), or to taste", "1/4 cup minced cilantro or mint leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the oil in a large, deep skillet and turn the heat to medium.
