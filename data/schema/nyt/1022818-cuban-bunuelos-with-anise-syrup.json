{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cuban Bu\u00f1uelos With Anise Syrup", "description": "For many Cubans, the Christmas season means that frying bu\u00f1uelos for dessert is almost as important as serving roast pork for dinner. Bu\u00f1uelos have roots in Spain, particularly a Spain once under Muslim rule, but the Cuban version, spiced with anise and shaped into figure eights, highlights the island\u2019s abundance of root vegetables like yuca, boniato, malanga, \u00f1ame and calabaza. They can be found in many Latino grocery stores, and they give the bu\u00f1uelos a pillowy, doughnutlike texture inside and crisp up when deep-fried.
