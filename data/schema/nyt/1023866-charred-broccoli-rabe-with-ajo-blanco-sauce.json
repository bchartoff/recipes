Rather than creating a chilled soup, she replaces the traditional almonds with cashews and boosts the flavor profile of ajo blanco with a hefty pile of blanched garlic cloves, for a surprisingly sweet, nutty sauce that softens the smoky, bitter notes of the charred broccoli rabe. This vegetarian side pairs with just about any protein, but it\u2019s got enough complexity to work as a main alongside some toasted bread and perhaps some beans. Its garlic flavor will linger, but you won\u2019t mind. \u2014Alexa Weibel", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nina Compton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/23/multimedia/aw-ajo-blanco-with-charred-broccoli-rabe-vlzj/aw-ajo-blanco-with-charred-broccoli-rabe-vlzj-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "baguette, broccoli rabe, cashew, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, lemon, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 29}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 ounces crusty country-style loaf or baguette", "3 1/2 ounces garlic cloves (from about 2 small heads), peeled", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup/3 \u00bd ounces roughly chopped roasted cashews", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "Salt", "Salt", "3 large bunches broccoli rabe (about 3 pounds), thick stems trimmed", "6 tablespoons olive oil, plus more if needed", "2 small lemons, halved crosswise", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated", "2 pinches red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the ajo blanco: Cut the bread into 3 pieces, transfer to a bowl and add enough water to soak the bread.
