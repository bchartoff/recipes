{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Vegan Hot Chocolate", "description": "For a vegan hot chocolate that rivals even the creamiest dairy-laden variety, add a few tablespoons of nut butter like almond, sunflower or peanut to the nondairy milk, chocolate chips and cocoa powder. Whisking is also essential here; nondairy products tend to contain stabilizers that keep them emulsified, so they can separate when boiled. If you keep whisking the mix as it heats and remove it from the stove when it\u2019s nice and steaming, but before it boils, you\u2019ll end up with perfectly smooth hot chocolate. Don\u2019t worry if it breaks: You can simply blend it with a whisk or immersion blender over low heat to bring it back together.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/dining/gk-dairy-free-hot-chocolate/gk-dairy-free-hot-chocolate-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "dairy-free milk, nut butter, vegan chocolate, vegan cocoa powder, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, dessert, side dish, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 72}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 239, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "16 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup vegan semisweet chocolate chips (about 2 ounces)", "3 tablespoons vegan unsweetened cocoa powder", "3 tablespoons creamy nut or seed butter, such as almond, sunflower or peanut", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1 1/2 to 2 cups unsweetened nut or grain milk, such as macadamia, walnut, almond, cashew, hazelnut, oat or rice milk", "1 to 3 teaspoons granulated sugar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine chocolate chips, cocoa powder, nut butter, salt and 1/2 cup nut or grain milk in a small saucepan.
