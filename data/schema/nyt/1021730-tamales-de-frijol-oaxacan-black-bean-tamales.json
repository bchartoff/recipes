{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tamales de Frijol (Oaxacan Black Bean Tamales)", "description": "On special occasions, such as saints\u2019 days, Alfonso Martinez prepares a special style of black bean tamal traditionally made by Zapotec communities in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca. A simple, pur\u00e9ed bean filling is carefully folded in a round of masa that\u2019s been squished with a tortilla press or flattened out by hand, and this process creates a delicate, layered package that\u2019s as beautiful as it is delicious. Mr. Martinez reaches for heirloom Oaxacan beans, though any variety of dried black beans that ends up tender will work well. And even though avocado leaves are traditionally used to sandwich the tamal inside the banana leaf wrapper, he says hoja or yerba santa leaves can also be cut to size to impart their herbal flavor.
