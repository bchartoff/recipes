If you prefer not to stuff the bread balls, you can skip that part and simply roll them until round, baking them in the same way. The extra cheese can then be added to the sauce around the bread balls just before broiling. This dough method isn\u2019t complicated, but you could work with store-bought pizza dough to save on time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/08/dining/Ottolenghi-dough-balls/merlin_180342117_f6e804e2-64fe-49bd-971e-725012b57f14-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, appetizer", "keywords": "bread flour, garlic, mozzarella, tomato, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 250}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/100 grams white bread flour", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters lukewarm water", "1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, plus more for brushing", "1/2 teaspoon active (fast-action) dry yeast", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters olive oil", "7 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "1 (14-ounce/400-gram) can plum tomatoes, well crushed by hand", "3 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves, plus 1 tablespoon for garnish", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh basil leaves, plus 2 tablespoons for garnish", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 1/2 ounces/100 grams low-moisture mozzarella"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the bread balls: Add the flour, lukewarm water, 1 1/2 teaspoons oil, the yeast and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer.
