The recipe was brought back to light by Richard Ferrugio, who catered the inaugural of Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1986. Mayor Van Cortlandt's swearing-in, Walt Whitman wrote, was a full-day affair \u201cmuch in keeping with the celebrations of the Old Netherlands.\u201d He added: \u201cVery popular were all the hot punches, seasoned and tempted with brandy.\u201d This is the perfect libation for a winter inaugural party, when you can watch a ceremony that lends a little class to the blood sport of politics.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Suzanne M.
