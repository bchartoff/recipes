{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame-Miso Chicken Salad", "description": "There\u2019s always room for another chicken salad recipe, especially if the assembly is quick. This one calls for a whole cooked chicken, which you can roast or boil gently several hours ahead or up to 2 days in advance. (Some may choose to buy a precooked rotisserie chicken, but it can sometimes be hard to find one that is seasoned or cooked properly. If you can find a good one, go for it.) The creamy miso dressing can also be used to dress a green salad, or to replace mayonnaise on a sandwich. It also makes a great dip for vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/01/dining/01Kitchenrex/merlin_141533394_0c66b900-8681-416a-836d-3cb20a6e74fd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry, salads and dressings", "keywords": "chicken, lettuce, miso, tahini, low-carb, main course, side dish, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 395}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 529, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1295 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons Asian sesame paste or tahini\u00a0", "4 tablespoons\u00a0white (shiro) miso", "3 tablespoons rice-wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon mirin, sake or sherry", "1 teaspoon grated ginger", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon roasted sesame oil", "1/4 cup vegetable oil", "Salt and pepper", "Small pinch of cayenne (optional)", "1 (3-pound) chicken, cooked", "2 heads small organic iceberg, Little Gems or romaine hearts", "2 medium cucumbers, peeled and sliced 1/8-inch thick, lightly salted", "3 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions or chives", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds, for garnish", "1 teaspoon toasted black sesame seeds, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put sesame paste,\u00a0miso, vinegar, mirin, ginger, sugar and lemon zest in a small mixing bowl.
