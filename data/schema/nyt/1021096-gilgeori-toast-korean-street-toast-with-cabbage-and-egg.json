{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gilgeori Toast (Korean Street Toast With Cabbage and Egg)", "description": "Gilgeori toast, which literally means \u201cstreet toast\u201d in Korean, is a popular salty-sweet egg sandwich sold by many street-food vendors in Korea. For many who grew up there, it's a nostalgic snack, reminiscent of childhood. Eaten for breakfast or lunch, it\u2019s quick, easy and adaptable. If you don\u2019t have cabbage on hand, toss in any vegetables you have that would add crunch and flavor, such as sliced scallions or julienned zucchini. For a modern twist, try substituting the sugar with different flavors of jam, or dress the sandwich up with your favorite condiments and sandwich fixings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Darun Kwak"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/21/dining/gilgeori/merlin_172693125_75a286c0-b33e-4c72-a1f9-ddd60104ba47-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 sandwich", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, weeknight, finger foods, sandwiches, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "bread, carrot, egg, green cabbage, jam, scallion, sugar, white bread", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1763}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces green cabbage, very thinly sliced (scant 1 1/4 cups)", "1/2 carrot, julienned (about 1/2 cup)", "2 scallions, thinly sliced diagonally", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1 egg (or 2 eggs; see Tip)", "2 1/2 tablespoons butter or margarine", "2 slices milk bread, brioche or white sandwich bread", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar, or 2 teaspoons jam", "1 slice of ham (optional)", "1 slice of American cheese or other sliced mild\u00a0cheese (optional)", "Ketchup and mayonnaise, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine cabbage, carrot, scallions, salt and pepper.
