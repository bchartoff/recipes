{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tuxedo Cobbler", "description": "This modern take on the Sherry Cobbler \u2014 and nod to the classic <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019018-tuxedo\">Tuxedo</a> and <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018986-tuxedo-no-2\">Tuxedo No. 2</a> cocktails \u2014 makes for a bright, refreshing drink that\u2019s slightly higher in alcohol by volume (or A.B.V.). The optional but highly recommended absinthe rinse lends a subtle yet grounding anise flavor to the drink. If you don\u2019t have absinthe, use a splash of anise-forward pastis. To rinse, add the absinthe to the glass and swirl to coat; tip out the rest. A pinch of salt both aids in balancing the drink and highlights manzanilla sherry\u2019s inherent salinity. If you don\u2019t have manzanilla, use fino or, if you\u2019re looking for a slightly richer drink, amontillado sherry.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/09/dining/03cobblersrex-tuxedo/merlin_215042796_f4246e06-706b-4f8b-81ef-874f30b61a13-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bitters, gin, sherry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 28}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 ounce absinthe (optional)", "6 thinly sliced lemon wheels", "1/2 ounce <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014441-simple-syrup\">simple syrup</a>", "Pinch of flaky sea salt", "1 1/2 ounces gin", "1 1/2 ounces manzanilla sherry", "4 dashes orange bitters", "Ice cubes", "Crushed ice, for serving (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chill a highball or Collins glass.
