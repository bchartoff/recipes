{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oven-Steamed Fish With Mixed-Nut Salsa", "description": "This recipe pairs two elements you can incorporate into many meals: a steaming method that accommodates any size of fillet and a nut salsa that\u2019s good on more than just fish. This recipe fashions a steamer using a baking dish, boiling water and the heat of the oven (see Tip for stovetop instructions), and steaming shows off the delicate flavor of mild fish and ensures tenderness even if things end up slightly overcooked. A crunchy and bright salsa made with salted mixed nuts \u2014 the kind usually served as bar snacks \u2014 balances the lightness of the fish, but it's also great on roasted chicken, winter squash, salad greens and more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/01/dining/as-steamed-fish-with-nut-salsa/as-steamed-fish-with-nut-salsa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "healthy, nuts, parsley, white fish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 555}, "recipeIngredient": ["Handful of parsley sprigs, plus \u00bd cup parsley leaves and tender stems, coarsely chopped", "1 1/2 pounds mild fish fillets of equal size (skin-on or skinless), such as cod, halibut, sole, grouper or salmon", "Salt and black pepper", "Boiling water", "1 cup mixed, salted nuts, coarsely chopped (avoid peanuts, if possible)", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 1/2 teaspoons unseasoned rice wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon honey"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
