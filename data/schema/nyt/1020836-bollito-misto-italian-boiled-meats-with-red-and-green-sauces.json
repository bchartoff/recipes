{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bollito Misto (Italian Boiled Meats With Red and Green Sauces)", "description": "Bollito misto is the Italian version of a boiled dinner, somewhat similar to the French pot au feu, but more complex. (A New England boiled dinner pales in comparison.) The dish can be quite an extravagant affair, with many cuts of veal, beef, tongue, sausages and a fat capon. This is a simpler version, though it is still a project and easier to complete if the work is spread over two or three days. But it is a worthy adventure. Serve the broth as a traditional first-course soup garnished with tortellini or other small stuffed pasta shapes, or plain, in little cups, for sipping. Two bright sauces \u2014 one green, one red \u2014 round out the dish as condiments.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/05/dining/03Tanisrex-bolito/merlin_167929602_5cb50414-9ee8-456b-92ac-ee397451a92c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P2DT5H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "meat", "keywords": "bone-in beef shank, chuck roast, cotechino, day-old bread, fennel bulbs, golden beet, Italian sausage, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pound chuck roast, rolled and tied", "3 pounds bone-in beef shank, sliced 1 1/2-inch thick", "Salt and pepper", "4 whole cloves", "2 bay leaves", "2 large onions, peeled", "1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "2 celery stalks", "2 large carrots, peeled", "1 precooked cotechino sausage (about 1 pound)", "6 sweet Italian sausages, with or without fennel seeds (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "8 medium carrots, peeled", "3 fennel bulbs, trimmed and cut into wedges", "6 medium golden beets, turnips or rutabaga, peeled, cut into wedges", "1 1/2 pounds small potatoes, such as Yukon Gold", "Parsley sprigs, for garnish", "3 bunches parsley, leaves and tender stems (about 3 cups)", "1 bunch basil, leaves only (about 2 cups)", "2 tablespoons capers in brine", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Generous pinch of red-pepper flakes", "Salt and pepper", "4 thinly sliced scallions", "2 tablespoons grated horseradish", "A few drops of red wine vinegar", "1 cup cubed day-old bread (1/2-inch pieces)", "1/4 cup red wine vinegar", "2 large roasted peppers (jarred are O.K.)", "2 small garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 teaspoon paprika (sweet or hot are fine, as long as it\u2019s fresh)", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the meats: Season chuck roast and beef shank generously with salt and pepper and let sit for 1 hour at room temperature or refrigerate overnight, if time permits.
