She dissolves sugar and salt in ice-cold water before adding it all to the flour to form a supple dough that\u2019s easy to roll and evenly seasoned. Here, vinegar is also stirred into the solution to ensure a tender crust. Whether you make the dough by hand, with a stand mixer or a food processor, you\u2019ll end up with a flaky pastry that tastes great with sweet or savory fillings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/13/dining/13PIESREX-butter-crust/merlin_214888215_15d69a3d-1be2-455a-8cb0-f88cdb7e9397-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 disks (for 2 single-crust pies or 1 double-crust pie)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, pies and tarts", "keywords": "freezer friendly, make-ahead, pie crust, white vinegar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 450}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/85 grams ice-cold water", "2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "1 cup/228 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "2 1/2 cups/330 grams all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir together the water, vinegar, sugar and salt until the sugar and salt dissolve.
