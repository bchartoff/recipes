{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Green Garlic Chicken Soup", "description": "This rustic soup features green garlic, a delicious seasonal specialty that comes to the market in early spring. The tender shoots are as small as scallions or tiny leeks. Left in the ground, they will grow to be full-sized heads of garlic by mid-summer, but these young specimens are wonderful, with a mild but distinct garlic flavor. If you can\u2019t find them, wild ramps make a good substitute. Otherwise, make this soup with 6 to 8 sliced cloves of regular garlic. The raw tomatillo salsa adds a welcome note of acidity and crunch. You can make it as spicy as you like by varying the amount of jalape\u00f1o.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/14/dining/14KITCH2/14KITCH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken, green garlic, tomatillo, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 125}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 820, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "58 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1571 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large chicken legs (thigh and drumstick), about 3 pounds\n", "Kosher salt and black pepper\n", "2 tablespoons olive oil\n", "1 large yellow onion, diced, about 3 cups\n", "4 medium carrots, peeled, cut in 2-inch chunks\n", "1 celery stalk, diced\n", "1 bay leaf \n", "1 clove\n", "2 bunches green garlic shoots, about 12 shoots (may substitute wild ramps)\n", "1 small white onion, finely diced, soaked in cold water for 1 hour, about 1/2 cup\n", "3 or 4 large tomatillos, husked and finely diced, about 1/2 cup\n", "1 or 2 jalape\u00f1o peppers, seeds removed, finely chopped\n", "3 tablespoons lime juice\n", "Lime wedges, for serving\n"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken legs generously with salt and pepper.
