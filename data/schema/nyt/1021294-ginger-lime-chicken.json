Mayonnaise is the secret ingredient in this recipe, which is a trick J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/dining/mayo-meat-marinade.html\">has written about</a>. When slathered on boneless chicken and cooked, the beloved condiment carries flavor, sticks to the meat well, encourages browning and prevents the pieces of lime zest and ginger \u2014 or whatever seasonings you choose \u2014 from burning. Try this technique first with ginger and lime zest, then experiment with grated garlic, jalape\u00f1o, lemon, Parmesan and whatever else you can imagine. Serve with a pile of white rice and a fresh green salad topped with thinly sliced avocado.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/09/dining/as-ginger-lime-chicken/as-ginger-lime-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, chicken thigh, fresh ginger, lime zest, mayonnaise", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 9811}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/3 cup mayonnaise", "1 tablespoon lime zest (from about 2 limes), plus lime wedges, for serving", "1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger (from a 3-inch piece of peeled ginger)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the chicken dry and season all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.
