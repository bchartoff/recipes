Opinions on various brands abound, but an excellent recipe is the key to baked good paradise. This recipe, one of three that were extensively tested, is for a golden brown emblem of cookie engineering. \n\nNote that in this crisp version the ingredients include milk and light corn syrup, and the balls of dough are quite small.
