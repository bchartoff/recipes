You don\u2019t need to season them, or oil them, or remove the thick outer leaves the way you\u2019d do if you were cooking them lightly or shredding them raw. You just need to\u00a0burn them, slowly and deeply, so that they soften within and take on the flavor of fire. When you\u2019ve got the cabbages good and blistered, put them on a cutting board, remove the charred exteriors and cut out the cores, then slice the remaining cabbage into shreds. Dress with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018885-crema\">crema,</a> store-bought or home-made, along with chopped cilantro, some chipotle en adobo and lime juice.
