{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Poached Rhubarb", "description": "I begin many of my rhubarb recipes by briefly poaching thick slices in a sugar syrup with the seeds and pod of a vanilla bean. (Don\u2019t be alarmed by the amount of sugar; it\u2019s mostly drained off.) It\u2019s a method I learned from the pastry chef Jacquy Pfeiffer. Once poached, the rhubarb has many uses, both sweet and savory. And the pink vanilla-specked syrup is delicious over ice cream or strawberries, or stirred into yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 1/2 cups (plus 1 2/3 cups syrup)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "rhubarb, vanilla bean", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 70}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 210, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "51 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/200 grams sugar", "1 vanilla bean, split and scraped", "2 cups diced rhubarb (1/2-inch dice)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine 1 1/4 cups water and the sugar in medium saucepan.
