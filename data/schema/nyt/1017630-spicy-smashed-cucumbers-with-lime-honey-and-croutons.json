In this salad, from the Manhattan restaurant Superiority Burger, the cold crunchy cucumbers are bound in a creamy lime-spiked yogurt that the chef who invented it, Julia Goldberg, calls \u201cfiercely acidic.\u201d It\u2019s a great combination, and the sweet heat of chile honey and crunch of breadsticks make each mouthful interesting. At Superiority Burger, nutty brown rice is added to the salad for yet another dimension of flavor and texture; the effect is like a rich chicken salad or egg salad, but this is vegetarian and more nutritious over all.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/18/dining/18CUKE/18CUKE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "cucumber, lime, sesame breadstick, yogurt, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 137}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 90, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "485 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 2 pounds thin-skinned cucumbers like English or Persian (8 to 10 mini cucumbers, 4 medium-size or 2 large greenhouse)", "Kosher salt", "Raw or granulated sugar", "1/2 cup Greek-style plain yogurt", "Freshly grated zest and juice of 1 lime", "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, more to taste", "4 scallions, minced", "1/2 teaspoon hot sauce", "1 tablespoon honey", "2/3 cup lightly crushed sesame breadsticks (crush breadsticks in a sealed plastic bag to the size of small croutons)", "Olive oil, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse cucumbers and pat dry.
