It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nHow about a kale salad? (Stick with me, please.) Just make a mustardy vinaigrette that\u2019ll stand up to the greens \u2014 mustard, olive oil, a splash of lemon juice, salt and pepper \u2014 then drizzle it over clean, chopped kale with a host of big-flavored mix-ins that wink at whatever season you\u2019re in without being dorky about it: dried cranberries or currants, say; pecans toasted with maple syrup and a pinch of cayenne; some crumbled blue cheese; a spray of croutons. Sweet, salty, spicy, sour. That and a chilled glass of red wine? Why don\u2019t we eat salads for dinner more often?\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17NORECIPE-KALE-SALAD/merlin_147765615_0853b467-3319-4fec-a410-63c6482c9bf9-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "blue cheese, cranberry, kale, pecan, low-carb, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 204}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020002-kale-salad-with-cranberries-pecans-and-blue-cheese"}
