But sometimes that is too simple a preparation. So how about lobster stew? Not difficult, and easier to eat.

With fingers, work half the butter (4 tablespoons) into the flour until completely incorporated. Add the remaining butter, leaving it in small chunks. Quickly stir in 1/4 cup ice water to form a somewhat sticky ball. Knead together briefly, wrap in plastic, and press to make a flat disk about 1-inch thick. Refrigerate overnight or for at least an hour. When ready to cook, heat the oven to 400 degrees. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface to a diameter of about 12 1/2 inches. Using an inverted bowl as a guide, cut two 6-inch diameter circles. (The remaining dough can be rerolled and saved for another purpose.) Mix egg yolk and half- and-half. Place the circles on a parchment-lined baking sheet and paint lightly with the egg yolk mixture. Bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees, then lower the temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking until nicely browned, about 10 minutes. (May be baked ahead, if desired, and reheated.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the stew: Place the lobsters in a large pot of rapidly boiling water over high heat. Cook for 6 minutes, then remove them and cool in a large bowl of cold water. Take the meat from the claws, tail and knuckles. (Discard the shells or use them for lobster stock.)
