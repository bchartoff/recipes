{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Handvo (Savory Vegetable Semolina Bread)", "description": "Handvo, a savory vegetable bread from the Indian state of Gujarat, is a near constant in the home of Anita Jaisinghani, the chef and owner of Pondicheri restaurant in Houston. Using hot water in the dough helps meld the flavors and hydrate the flours, as well as kickstart the leavening process. Ms. Jaisinghani makes many different versions \u2014 this carrot one is layered with the fragrance of toasted spices, the warmth of ginger and the freshness of herbs. Thanks to the pumpkin and sesame seeds that toast on top while it bakes, it also has an extra crunchy crust. The accompanying yogurt sauce is quickly \u2014 and deliciously \u2014 seasoned with aromatic spices tempered in oil. This is typically served as a snack, but is substantial enough to be a light meal when served with a salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rachel Wharton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/21/dining/16doughrex2/merlin_185501910_67fc0278-7353-43c3-998f-8bad989be2a7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "carrot, cilantro, fenugreek, peanut, yogurt, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 64}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup vegetable oil", "1/4 cup roasted unsalted peanuts, chopped", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "30 to 40 fresh curry leaves (from 3 to 4 stems), chopped (see Tips)", "2 medium carrots, coarsely grated (198 grams; 1 1/2 cups loosely packed)", "1 cup/130 grams semolina flour", "1 cup/64 grams chopped fresh fenugreek leaves and stems or 1/4 cup dried fenugreek (see Tips)", "1/2 cup/29 grams chopped fresh cilantro leaves", "1/2 cup/113 grams plain whole-milk yogurt, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons chickpea or lentil flour (optional)", "1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon red chile powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds", "2 tablespoons raw pumpkin seeds (pepitas)", "1/2 cup plain whole-milk yogurt, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon black mustard seeds", "10 to 12 fresh curry leaves (from 1 stem), chopped", "Pinch of red chile powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange an oven rack in the lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the handvo: In a large (10-inch) cast-iron or nonstick oven-safe skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high.
