Mix lemon and lime zest with eggs, sugar and cream, and then refrigerate for up to two days -- the longer   the better. Then, bake it in ramekins for about half an hour, and serve. Superfine sugar can be found in the baking aisle or made with regular sugar using a mortar and pestle. \n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/21/dining/limecream-still/limecream-still-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, side dish, lemon, lime", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 196}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 437, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "91 milligrams", "sugarContent": "50 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Finely grated zest and juice of 2 lemons", "Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime", "1 1/2 cups superfine sugar", "6 large eggs", "1 1/4 cups heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing bowl, combine lemon zest and juice, lime zest and juice, sugar and eggs.
