{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Vegetable Donabe", "description": "Donabe refers to the Japanese clay pot traditionally used to make this warming dish. Clay holds heat for a longer period of time than other materials. This one-pot comforting donabe is made in a Dutch oven, which still keeps heat well and can accommodate a party of four. Chicken, vegetables and broth are combined in the pot and simmered together; as it cooks, the soothing broth is reinforced with fragrant aromatics and the flavorful juices from the chicken and vegetables. A citrusy ponzu sauce adds a bright, fresh finish to the otherwise mellow dish. Yuzu kosho, a Japanese fermented condiment made with fresh chiles, yuzu peel and salt, adds a pop of heat to the donabe, but it can be left out for a milder dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/20/dining/kc-chicken-and-vegetable-donabe/merlin_198975393_73625a2a-1031-4bef-ad92-5209d32fab12-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "chicken, daikon, mushroom, soup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 893}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeled and halved", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 6), sliced into 1/8-inch-thick strips", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 ounces tender mushrooms, such as maitake, beech or enoki, or a combination, stemmed and broken into large clusters", "6 ounces napa cabbage, chopped into 2-inch pieces (about 2 cups)", "6 ounces daikon, peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced crosswise 1/4-inch thick\u00a0", "3 scallions, cut into 1-inch lengths", "1 large carrot, peeled and thinly sliced", "1/4 cup ponzu", "1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "1 teaspoon yuzu kosho (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, combine broth, garlic and ginger.
