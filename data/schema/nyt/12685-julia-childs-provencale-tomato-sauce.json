It is a tomato sauce with onions, garlic and basil, raised high with a perfumed whiff of orange peel and coriander seed. Make it when the farmers\u2019 market is overflowing with good tomatoes, freeze it in plastic bags, and use it until there is no more. It is a combination of two things Mrs. Child loved: good technique and fresh Proven\u00e7al flavors. It is a great recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/15/dining/15MYFAVORITE3/15MYFAVORITE3-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 1 quart", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "dairy-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 290}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 40, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "225 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "2/3 cup finely minced yellow onions", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 teaspoons all-purpose flour", "5 to 6 pounds ripe tomatoes, quartered", "1/8 teaspoon sugar, plus more to taste", "4 cloves garlic, minced or put through a press", "A large herb bouquet: 8 sprigs parsley, 1 bay leaf and 4 sprigs thyme, all tied in cheesecloth", "1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds", "1/2 teaspoon dried basil, oregano, marjoram or savory", "Large pinch saffron threads", "1 dozen coriander seeds, lightly crushed", "1 2-inch piece dried orange peel (or 1/2 teaspoon granules)", "2 to 3 tablespoons tomato paste (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-low heat.
