It toasts beautifully, which is recommended to add a bit of sturdiness to the soft crumb. Make sure you let the dough proof fully before baking, otherwise the surface of the buns might split. The recipe time factors in dough preparation.

Scrape the dough from the bowl and place on the work surface. Use the heel of your hand to knock out the gas and deflate the risen dough, which will be quite firm. Using a kitchen scale and a bench scraper or a knife, portion the dough into 10 equal pieces. (Each piece will weigh about 113 grams.) If you don\u2019t have a kitchen scale, you can eyeball it."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Form the buns: Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold it onto itself a few times to create a smooth surface, then gather the edges and pinch them together to form a smooth bundle of dough that looks like a garlic bulb. Place it seam-side down on the work surface and position your hand over the dough, palm barely touching the top and fingers lightly cupping it and resting on the work surface. Drag your hand \u2014 and the dough with it \u2014 slowly across the surface, moving it in small rapid circles. The friction between the dough and the surface will help tighten the dome so your buns will have a uniform, round shape. You shouldn\u2019t need to add flour, since the cold dough is easier to handle and less sticky, but if your dough is slightly warm or otherwise sticky, add just a bit of flour to make it easier to handle. Continue with all the pieces of dough, then arrange the balls on the prepared baking sheets, 5 per sheet, spacing evenly."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Proof the buns: The buns proof best in a humid environment, so use a spray bottle, if you have one, to lightly spritz the baking sheets with water, or just sprinkle some water around the buns with your fingertips.

Let sit at room temperature, undisturbed, until the buns have doubled in size and appear puffed and balloonlike, 1 1/2 to 2 hours."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, arrange one oven rack in the upper third and one in the lower third of the oven, then heat it to 350 degrees.
