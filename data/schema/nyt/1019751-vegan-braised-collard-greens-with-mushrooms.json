{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Braised Collard Greens With Mushrooms", "description": "When you remove the ham from collard greens, you\u2019ll have to find that smoky savoriness elsewhere. This recipe makes up for the lost ham with four critical ingredients: Mushroom stock that comes together in 30 minutes, rehydrated shiitakes, smoked paprika and soy sauce. The bitter, sour collard greens are sweetened with just a smidge of maple syrup at the end. If you don\u2019t have any on hand, add 1 teaspoon of white or brown sugar when you add the onions. And if you like your greens extra sour, serve the bowls with lemon wedges.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jampel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/13/dining/sj-vegan-collards/sj-vegan-collards-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "carrot, celery, collard greens, cremini, shiitake, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 26}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 67, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "177 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 large sprig rosemary", "1 large sprig fresh thyme", "10 ounces cremini mushrooms, halved", "1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 onion, quartered", "2 stalks celery, roughly chopped", "1 bay leaf", "4 dried shiitake mushrooms", "Kosher salt, to taste", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "10 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 medium onion, sliced into \u00bc-inch half moons", "3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika", "2 pounds collard greens (about 3 to 4 bunches), large stems removed, washed, and cut into \u00bc-inch ribbons", "1 to 2 tablespoons soy sauce, to taste", "1 teaspoon maple syrup (optional)", "Lemon wedges (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the stock: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
