{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken and Farro With Caramelized Leeks", "description": "This very savory skillet dinner features golden pieces of bone-in chicken nestled in a leek and farro pilaf. You might be surprised to see the leek greens used along with the whites. But, because the slices are saut\u00e9ed until tender and then simmered with the farro, they turn soft and sweet, and contribute loads of deep onion flavor. (Added bonus: It\u2019s nice to use the whole vegetable.) A simple tomato relish garnishes the top, adding juicy freshness to this hearty one-pot meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/19/dining/17alliumrex3-chicken/17alliumrex3-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, farro, leeks, parsley, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 900}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and drumsticks, or use whole legs", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 large or 3 medium leeks", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon fennel or coriander seeds, cracked with a mortar and pestle or the side of a chef\u2019s knife", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds, cracked with a mortar and pestle or the side of a chef\u2019s knife", "4 thyme sprigs", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "3 cups chicken or vegetable stock", "1 1/2 cups pearled or semi-pearled farro", "3/4 cup quartered or halved cherry tomatoes or diced tomato", "1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped", "Fresh lime or lemon juice, or cider vinegar, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken dry with paper towels.
