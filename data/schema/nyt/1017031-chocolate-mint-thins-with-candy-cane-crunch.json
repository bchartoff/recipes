A bright, festive decoration of crushed candy canes adds color and crunch. If store-bought dark chocolate cookies are available, you can use them instead of making your own. And if you temper the coating chocolate instead of simply melting it, your chocolate shell will have a bit more snap and durability.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/03/dining/03COOKFIGHT2/03COOKFIGHT2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 5 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, candies", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, candy canes, peppermint extract, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 414}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 111, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "22 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/230 grams granulated sugar", "12 tablespoons/170 grams/1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened at room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams kosher salt", "1 egg", "1 teaspoon peppermint extract", "1 1/2 cups/187 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/63 grams unsweetened cocoa, preferably Dutch-process", "8 to 12 candy canes", "About 16 ounces/500 grams semisweet or bittersweet chocolate", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 tablespoons coconut oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "To make the cookies:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a mixer, cream sugar and butter together until very fluffy, at least 3 minutes.
