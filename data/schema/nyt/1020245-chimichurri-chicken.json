{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chimichurri Chicken", "description": "Green chimichurri, the classic Argentinian sauce often made with fresh herbs, garlic, red-pepper flakes and red-wine vinegar, livens up whatever it\u2019s spooned over: steak, chicken, tofu, fish or vegetables. In this simple recipe, boneless chicken gets three layers of zesty chimichurri flavor: First, it\u2019s marinated in the sauce. Then, it\u2019s saut\u00e9ed, grilled or roasted, which further intensifies the flavors and encourages caramelization. Finally, just before serving, it\u2019s drizzled with fresh chimichurri for a bright finish.\u00a0You can make the sauce in a food processor, but chopping the aromatics by hand makes it especially fragrant. Keep the extra to serve with the chicken, alongside fluffy white rice, crusty bread or creamy potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/dining/as-chimichurri-chicken/as-chimichurri-chicken-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "chicken, chicken breast, chicken thigh, garlic, oregano, parsley, red pepper flakes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 493}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 cup parsley leaves and stems", "1/2 cup fresh oregano leaves", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "3 tablespoons red-wine vinegar", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts", "1 tablespoon olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: On a cutting board, smash and coarsely chop the garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
