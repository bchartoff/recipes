{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basque Country", "description": "The equal proportions of vermouth and cider make this cocktail especially easy to pour or batch up. Choose a cider with a bit of tartness and funk, and reach for a quality red vermouth. Sweet and slightly viscous, it stands up to and smooths out the cider\u2019s personality. Finally, don\u2019t skimp on the garnish. The orange, olives and peppers should be deployed in a way that feels less like decoration and more like a snack. Drop the skewer straight into your cocktail to impart notes of citrus and brine \u2014 or lay it on top to snack on and sip at your leisure.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/01/dining/01ciderrex2-vermouth/01ciderrex2-vermouth-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "cider, guindilla peppers, sweet vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 137}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice", "1 1/2 ounces sweet vermouth", "1 1/2 ounces Basque or Basque-style cider", "Orange half wheels, green olives (such as Manzanilla), Guindilla peppers (also called Piparras), for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a lowball glass with ice.
