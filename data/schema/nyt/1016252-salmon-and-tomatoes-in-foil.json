Layer salmon, tomato and basil on lightly oiled foil and wrap it all up \u2014 you can even do it a night before cooking. When the time for dinner comes, you can steam, grill, roast or pan-grill the packages \u2014 though our testing shows roasting is easiest. You can substitute almost anything comparable for each of the ingredients: salmon can be replaced by any fish steak or fillet, or by boneless, skinless chicken breast. The herb and vegetable can also be varied at will, as long as the vegetable will finish cooking at the same time as the protein: if you were cooking broccoli, for example, you would have to cut it into small pieces; if carrots, you'd have to parboil them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/dining/mb-salmon-and-tomatoes-in-foil/merlin_151791966_abb05c69-bdb1-46ee-9bf3-92205387ec0c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday", "keywords": "healthy, high protein, low-fat, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1693}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 306, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "339 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds salmon fillet, cut crosswise (4 pieces)", "12 cherry tomatoes, sliced in half", "Salt and pepper", "16 basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For each of 4 packages, place one 12-inch-long sheet of aluminum foil on top of another.
