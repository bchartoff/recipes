{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fluffy Mashed Potatoes", "description": "For the silkiest fluffy mashed potatoes, start with firm, cool Russet Burbank spuds, also known as baking potatoes. They\u2019re the easiest to mash without becoming pasty and are even tastier steamed instead of boiled. Boiling potatoes can leave them waterlogged, diluting their earthy subtle sweetness, but steaming them preserves their inherent flavor. As the potatoes soften, they absorb just the right amount of moisture. Seasoning the dish only at the very end heightens their intrinsic subtle sweetness. If you have a ricer, use it for an exceptionally smooth texture: Press the steamed potatoes through the ricer back into the pot, then gently fold in the butter and milk with a wooden spoon or flexible spatula.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/12Korex2/merlin_197633112_0cd0e5f6-5532-4869-a85d-a8c4ef98d124-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, side dish", "keywords": "christmas, easter, thanksgiving, make-ahead, mashed potato, milk, russet potatoes, salted butter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1125}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds russet potatoes", "1 cup whole milk, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup cold salted butter, cut into pats", "Salt", "Freshly ground white or black pepper", "1/4 cup heavy cream, plus more as needed (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a steamer: Arrange an insert or basket (or a large colander, if you have neither) in a large pot, and add enough water to come just below the base of the steamer.
