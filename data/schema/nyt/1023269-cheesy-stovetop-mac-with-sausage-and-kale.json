It\u2019s reminiscent of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020728-homemade-hamburger-helper\">hamburger skillet macs</a>, which gained popularity in the 1970s, thanks to Hamburger Helper, when beef prices were high and families wanted to stretch a pound of meat. This kale-packed version spices up that classic with herby sweet Italian sausage, fresh garlic, red-pepper flakes and hot sauce. Like the original, the starch from the pasta helps thicken the cooking liquid into a quick sauce that becomes creamy once the cheese is added. Serve with a crisp green salad and toasted bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Romel Bruno"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/22/dining/RB-Cheesy-Stovetop-Mac-WithSausage-and-Kale/RB-Cheesy-Stovetop-Mac-WithSausage-and-Kale-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "cheddar, italian sausage, kale", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1046}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 white onion, diced", "1 large bunch kale, leaves only, coarsely chopped", "Kosher salt", "3 large garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 pound loose sweet Italian sausage (see Tip)", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "6 cups low-sodium chicken broth or water", "1 pound short pasta (such as macaroni, cavatappi or fusilli)", "2 cups/8 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar", "1 1/2 teaspoons hot sauce, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil in a large, wide pot or a very large, deep skillet over medium-high, then add the onion, kale and \u00bd teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale has cooked down and the onion is smaller in size, 4 to 5 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until the paste darkens slightly, 1 to 3 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the sausage and cook, breaking the meat into small pieces, until it loses its pink color, 4 to 5 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the red-pepper flakes, sprinkle with salt and give everything a good stir.
