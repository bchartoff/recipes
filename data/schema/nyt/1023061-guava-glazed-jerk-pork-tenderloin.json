{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Guava-Glazed Jerk Pork Tenderloin", "description": "Jerk is a powerfully complex blend of spices and aromatics redolent with cinnamon, allspice, cumin and chiles. Historically, it\u2019s tied to Maroons fleeing enslavement in the Jamaican foothills, and is among the most iconic flavors of the Caribbean. True jerk is grilled over an open fire, and is as much a seasoning as it is an action, because you can \u201cjerk\u201d pork, goat, chicken and even fruits and vegetables. It\u2019s often applied to dark, often gamey or gristly cuts of meat that stand up to complex flavors. While not traditional, this leaner, lighter pork is an excellent vessel for jerk. It\u2019s especially good when marinated overnight and grilled, but is so simple to prepare it can easily be made for a weeknight celebration. A simple jelly glaze at the end adds sweetness and tang, caramelizing under a quick broil.
