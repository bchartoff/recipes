{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Halibut With Spinach and Chickpea Stew", "description": "This highly aromatic dish is inspired by pkaila,\u00a0a Tunisian condiment made by frying spinach in plenty of oil for a long time (traditionally hours) until it becomes almost black in color. This slow-frying transforms the spinach into a rich and flavorful version of itself. Here, the spinach isn't fried in so much oil, or for as long, but it still delivers a uniquely rich and wholly unexpected depth to the dish. The spinach stew can be made ahead of time but, if you do so, season the fish and chickpeas close to the time when you are going to cook them. The Persian lime powder is optional. You can buy it, or start with a whole dried Persian lime: Roughly crush it with the side of a knife and then grind to a fine powder in a spice grinder.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/12/dining/12Ottorex1/12Ottorex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, soups and stews", "keywords": "chickpea, green chili, halibut, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 93}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/60 milliliters olive oil", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/4 teaspoon dried Persian lime powder (optional, see note)", "2 garlic cloves, crushed", "2 teaspoons lemon zest", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 skinless, boneless halibut fillets, patted dry (about 1 pound/410 grams total)", "1 can chickpeas (15.5 ounces/400 grams), drained and patted dry", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil, for frying", "Olive oil", "3/4 cup (80 grams) finely chopped yellow onion", "3 garlic cloves, crushed", "2 mild green chile peppers, such as Anaheim, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon dried Persian lime powder (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 fresh cinnamon stick, roughly crushed", "1 1/4 packed cups/50 grams cilantro (coriander)", "1/2 packed cup/25 grams flat-leaf parsley", "1 pound/400 grams baby spinach", "1 1/4 teaspoons flaky sea salt", "2 cups/500 milliliters chicken or vegetable stock", "1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar or caster sugar", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 lemon (peel the skin to get 3 strips and juice to get 2 tablespoons)", "1 mild green chile pepper, such as Anaheim, halved lengthwise and finely sliced", "2 spring onions, finely sliced on an angle", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 packed tablespoons/5 grams cilantro (coriander), roughly sliced", "Flaky sea salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate the fish and chickpeas: In a small bowl, mix the first 7 ingredients together.
