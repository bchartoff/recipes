These Proven\u00e7al-inspired tuna rillettes are a modified version of a <a href=\" http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016463-tuna-tapenade\">tuna tapenade</a> that I posted a few years ago on Recipes for Health. I am using the rillettes as a filling for mini-peppers here, but they are also welcome in a sandwich, on crackers or croutons, or as a filling for other vegetables (cherry tomatoes come to mind). I used a mini-chop to finely chop the olives, garlic and capers, but as in all of this week\u2019s fish rillettes recipes, I urge you to use a fork for the tuna.
