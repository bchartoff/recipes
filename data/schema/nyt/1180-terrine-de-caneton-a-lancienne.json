Terrine isn\u2019t a weeknight dish, but a true indulgence for a special occasion. Whether it\u2019s for a holiday or a dinner party, terrine is, in fact, fortunately a lot like meatloaf: It improves with age, so it\u2019s great the next day, tucked into a sandwich, or spread onto a baguette. Don\u2019t forget the cornichons, or, as Ms. Harmon suggests, the bread-and-butter pickles. They\u2019re a briny contrast to the terrine\u2019s creaminess.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nancy Harmon Jenkins"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, duckling, pork liver, winter", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 678, "unsaturatedFatContent": "34 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "617 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (4 1/2-pound) duckling", "8 ounces pork liver", "1 medium carrot, scraped and coarsely chopped", "1 medium turnip, peeled and coarsely chopped", "1 medium onion, peeled and coarsely chopped", "1 medium tomato, coarsely chopped", "2 cups water", "Herb bouquet (13 sprigs parsley, 2 sprigs thyme, 1 bay leaf and 1 leaf of fresh celery tied in cheesecloth)", "2 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste", "10 or more dashes freshly ground black pepper, or to taste", "4 eggs, lightly beaten", "2 tablespoons heavy cream", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped", "4 shallots, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley", "1/4 teaspoon or more quatre epices, made from 10 ground cloves, 1 ground cinnamon stick, 2/3 teaspoon ground ginger and 3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper", "1/4 cup Armagnac (2 ounces)", "4 ounces clarified butter or rendered chicken fat"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bone duck, or have butcher do it, scraping away meat and ligaments.
