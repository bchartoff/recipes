{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Artichokes and Herbs", "description": "This weeknight sheet-pan dinner takes inspiration from <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017068-porchetta-pork-roast\">porchetta</a>, the classic Italian pork roast that\u2019s scented with fennel and herbs. Here, a fragrant spice rub of ground fennel, garlic, rosemary and sage is placed onto chicken thighs, instantly elevating plain chicken with minimal effort. Canned artichokes are a versatile and time-saving pantry staple, commonly tossed into salads but here, they are fantastic roasted. The juicy chicken thighs create a bright pan sauce mixed with briny olives and lemon juice. Leftovers can be chopped and tossed with mayonnaise for a fantastic chicken salad the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/27/dining/kc-sheet-pan-porchetta-chicken/merlin_186775143_eb7f51dd-b97f-4579-8f75-7235a34f7755-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, roasts, main course", "keywords": "artichoke hearts, chicken thigh, fennel, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1058}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large fennel bulbs (about 3 pounds), trimmed, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges", "2 (14-ounce) cans whole artichoke hearts in water, drained and halved lengthwise", "8 ounces cherry tomatoes", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "2 tablespoons ground fennel", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage", "8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)", "1/2 cup pitted green olives, chopped", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.\u00a0On a rimmed baking sheet, combine fennel wedges, artichokes, tomatoes and 3 tablespoons oil.
