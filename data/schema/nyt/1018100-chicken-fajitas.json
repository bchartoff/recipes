The sauce has enough heat, so I don\u2019t use the canned chipotles, though you could add one if you wanted. I hold back a couple of tablespoons of the marinade and use it to finish the vegetables and deglaze the pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/17/dining/chicken-fajitas/chicken-fajitas-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "tacos", "keywords": "adobo sauce, bell pepper, chicken breast, jalape\u00f1o, tortilla, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 362}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 535, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1011 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Finely grated zest of 1 lime (about 2 teaspoons)", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice", "Salt and black pepper", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "2 tablespoons adobo sauce from canned chipotles in adobo\u00a0", "1 chipotle chile in adobo, seeded and minced (optional)", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 large garlic cloves, minced or put through a press", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast", "1 large red or yellow onion, halved and sliced", "2 red bell peppers (or 1 red and 1 orange or yellow), seeded and sliced about 1/4 inch thick", "1 green bell pepper, seeded and sliced about 1/4 inch thick", "1 jalape\u00f1o or 2 serrano chiles, minced", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "4 large flour or 8 corn tortillas", "1 tablespoon grapeseed or canola oil (or use olive oil)", "1 romaine heart, sliced crosswise", "Salsa fresca, for serving (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018098-salsa-fresca\">see recipe</a>)", "Queso fresco, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine lime zest and juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, the adobo sauce and optional minced chipotle, 1/4 cup olive oil and half the garlic.
