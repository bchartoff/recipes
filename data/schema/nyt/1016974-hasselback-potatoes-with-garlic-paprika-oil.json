The large size of Idaho potatoes \u2014 often 3 to 4 pounds each in the 19th century, nourished by volcanic soil and Snake River water \u2014 is the source of the mystique. \nThe Hasselback potato, named for the hotel in Stockholm where the recipe was invented in the 1950s, shows off the sheer mass of the Idaho potato like nothing else. In the original, the potato is wrapped in bacon, but you can get good smoky flavor and a gorgeous ruddy color by using smoked paprika.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19IDAHO/19IDAHO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "garlic, russet potatoes, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 255}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 289, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "735 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 large Idaho or other large russet potatoes, about 1 pound each", "2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil or a neutral oil like grapeseed", "4 plump garlic cloves, smashed, peeled and left whole", "1 tablespoon sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)", "Kosher or coarse sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place whole unpeeled potatoes in a pot.
