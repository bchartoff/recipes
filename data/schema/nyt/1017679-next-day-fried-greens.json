Dora Charles, who put this recipe in her book, \u201cA Real Southern Cook: In Her Savannah Kitchen,\u201d says a lot of people she feeds won\u2019t eat greens the first time around but love them in this dish, which uses the leftovers. You can add extra meat on the second cooking to make the dish more satisfying. Ms. Charles uses converted, or parboiled rice, but you can substitute any rice you have, including leftover Chinese takeout. Serve the greens with pepper vinegar or red pepper flakes and red wine vinegar to season at the table.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/02/dining/02DORAWEB8/02DORAWEB8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "collard greens, pork neck bones, vidalia onion, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 357, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "34 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound smoked pork neck bones and fresh pigs\u2019 tails, or smoked turkey wings, or a pork chop or ham hock", "1 tablespoon Dora\u2019s Savannah seasoning (see note)", "1 teaspoon crushed red pepper", "2 tablespoons bacon grease", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large bunch collards, about 1 pound", "1/4 Vidalia onion, cut into half moons", "2 cups cooked white rice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil.
