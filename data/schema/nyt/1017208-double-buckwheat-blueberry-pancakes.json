{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Double-Buckwheat Blueberry Pancakes", "description": "I call these double-buckwheat pancakes because I use both buckwheat flour and cooked buckwheat (kasha) in the batter. Cooked whole grains always contribute moisture and great texture to pancakes, and kasha has such a wonderful nutty flavor as well. I use half buckwheat flour and half whole wheat flour in the batter; if you don\u2019t eat gluten you could substitute a gluten-free all-purpose flour for the whole wheat flour. The buckwheat is already gluten-free but an all-buckwheat flour batter would be difficult to work with, a bit too heavy and sticky. This batter is already dense and a bit sticky (that\u2019s the buckwheat flour), but the pancakes are not heavy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/07/science/recipehealthpancakes/recipehealthpancakes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "serving 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 84}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "478 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup / 100 grams buckwheat flour", "3/4 cup / 100 grams whole wheat flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "Scant 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 large or extra large eggs", "1 1/2 cups / 355 ml buttermilk", "1 tablespoon honey (can be a strong honey like buckwheat honey) or agave nectar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 tablespoons grapeseed oil or melted butter", "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017205-kasha\">3/4 cup /113 grams cooked kasha</a>", "6 ounces / 1 1/3 cups (1 box) fresh or frozen blueberries", "1/2 teaspoon all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat a griddle."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sift together flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In another bowl, whisk eggs, then add buttermilk and honey or agave nectar, and whisk together.
