{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sizzled Five-Spice Shrimp With Red Pepper", "description": "This flavorful wok-fried shrimp dish makes an easy but very impressive dinner. Bright and spicy, it calls for strips of ripe red Fresno chiles, which are not very hot and available in the produce section of most supermarkets. Use red bell peppers instead if you want to tame the heat. Look for fresh or frozen wild shrimp when possible, from the Eastern Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico or Alaska. Make sure to buy farmed shrimp from a certified sustainable source; imported farmed shrimp are not always reliable or of good quality.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/20/dining/20KITCHEN/20KITCHEN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, seafood", "keywords": "bok choy, Fresno chile, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 229}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 222, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "807 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined", "Salt\u00a0", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder (see Note)", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "2 tablespoons Chinese rice wine, sake or dry sherry", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "2 pounds baby bok choy or mustard greens, trimmed\u00a0", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil", "6 ripe, red Fresno chiles, split lengthwise, seeded and cut into thin strips (or use 2 large bell peppers)", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne or crushed red pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon sesame oil", "1 teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted", "1/4 cup slivered scallions, for garnish", "Cilantro sprigs, for garnish", "Lime wedges, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Spread shrimp out in one layer on a baking sheet.
