{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Saltimbocca", "description": "Saltimbocca's name means to \u201cjump in the mouth\u201d with flavor. It is a restaurant dish, but at home on a weeknight, a chicken breast version makes a very tasty facsimile. Pound the chicken and marinate it in a mixture of chopped sage, garlic and olive oil, then brown it quickly before it goes under the broiler with cheese and a slice of prosciutto. Fried sage leaves make a savory garnish. There\u2019s no sauce. Wilted spinach is the best accompaniment by far. Actually, it fits right in with the current nostalgic trend toward retro Italian-American cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/17/dining/17KITCH5_SPAN/17KITCH5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "chicken breast, fontina, prosciutto, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 727}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "405 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast cut into 4-ounce pieces", "Salt and pepper", "1 tablespoon chopped sage, plus 24 large sage leaves", "2 garlic cloves smashed to a paste", "1 pinch red pepper flakes, optional", "Olive oil", "6 thin slices prosciutto", "6 slices fontina cheese (about 4 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a meat mallet, pound the chicken to flatten a bit.
