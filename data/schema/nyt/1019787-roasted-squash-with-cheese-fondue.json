{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Squash With Cheese Fondue", "description": "This autumnal dish turns a classic cheese fondue into a sauce for whole roasted squash. The lightly caramelized squash are filled with the gooey fondue mixture and topped with crunchy, garlicky bread crumbs. When the squash are cut, the cheese sauce runs onto the serving plate, to be spooned back over the soft, amber slices. Serve this as a side dish to roasted meats or fish, or as a rich appetizer on its own. For the best presentation, choose squash that are about the same shape and size.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/05/dining/05apperex1/05apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dry white wine, emmenthaler, gruy\u00e8re, squash, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 86}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 320, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "454 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium carnival or acorn squash", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "Kosher salt, as needed", "Freshly ground black pepper, as needed", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 to 4 anchovies, minced (optional)", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1 teaspoon lemon thyme or regular thyme leaves, finely chopped", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "6 ounces grated\u00a0Gruy\u00e8re", "6 ounces grated Emmenthaler or Swiss cheese", "2 teaspoons cornstarch", "1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 shallot, minced", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1/4 teaspoon mustard powder", "Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg", "Fresh lemon juice, to taste (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
