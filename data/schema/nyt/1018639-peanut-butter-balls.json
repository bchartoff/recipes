In the Midwest, they are known as buckeyes because they look like the nut of a buckeye tree, thanks to an exposed circle of peanut butter that's left after they're dipped in chocolate. Be sure to start with a good-quality peanut butter, and don\u2019t skimp on the salt. Those small touches carry a lot of impact.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/08/dining/08COOKING-BUCKEYES1/08COOKING-BUCKEYES1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "About 30 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "candies, cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert, peanut butter, semisweet chocolate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 329}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 122, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "49 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/242 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 cup/270 grams sweetened, smooth peanut butter", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "5 ounces/142 grams semisweet chocolate"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
