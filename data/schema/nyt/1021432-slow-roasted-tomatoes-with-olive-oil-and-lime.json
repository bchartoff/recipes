{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Roasted Tomatoes With Olive Oil and Lime", "description": "Inspired by a meal at Le Jardin des Plumes in the French town of Giverny, where the artist Monet lived and worked, this dish is as beautiful as it is unusual: It\u2019s simply a tomato gently roasted and basted with olive oil. It tastes vegetal and rich, as you\u2019d expect, but it\u2019s also sweet and citrusy. The surprise is at the core, which gets filled with sugar and lime zest. During the hours in the oven, the oil, sugar and zest find their way into every fiber of the tomato, technically making it a kind of confit, a dish usually cooked in fat or sugar \u2014 or, in this case, both. Serve the tomato warm or at room temperature as a starter, perhaps with a tiny salad, or, for your most adventurous friends, serve it chilled for dessert, topped with vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of oil and some flaky salt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/magazine/20Eat/20Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "appetizer, dessert, side dish", "keywords": "extra virgin olive oil, lemon oil, lime, sea salt, tomato, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 497}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice cubes, as needed", "4 medium, ripe but firm round tomatoes", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 limes", "1/4 teaspoon pure lemon or lime oil or extract (see Tip), optional", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, preferably mild and fruity", "Maldon or other flaky sea salt", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven and heat to 200 degrees.
