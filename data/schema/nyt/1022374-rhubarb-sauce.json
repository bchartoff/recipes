Glossy and sweet-tart, it tastes fabulous in iced coffee, cocktails and other mixed drinks, and is especially welcome over vanilla ice cream. The optional vanilla bean adds musky warmth that extract does not, so skip it completely \u2014 don\u2019t substitute \u2014 if not using. With this recipe, you get two goodies: the sauce of course, and the strained fruit that remains, which is great draped over yogurt in the morning or spread onto a slice of buttered toast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/12SAUCESREX17-sweet-EK-rhubarb-sauce/merlin_190354074_a5d30350-5ac9-4ecf-8317-df496e834cd9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "lemon, rhubarb, sugar, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 115}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds rhubarb, trimmed and cut into 3-inch pieces", "1 cup granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon lemon zest, and 2 to 3 tablespoons juice (from 1 large lemon)", "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
