The blondie base replaces some of the flour with graham cracker crumbs, and is studded with large chunks of chocolate and marshmallow. Use chopped bar chocolate rather than chocolate chips, which contain stabilizers and don\u2019t fully melt (though substituting chips will still result in a delicious blondie). As the blondies finish baking, they\u2019re topped with a layer of marshmallows and another round of chocolate; messy and delicious, just like the real thing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/02/dining/em-smores-blondies/em-smores-blondies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 blondies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, butter, graham cracker, marshmallow, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 703}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick spray", "9 whole graham crackers (about 135 grams), or store-bought graham cracker crumbs (about 1 cup)", "1 1/4 cups/160 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 packed cup/220 grams dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "8 ounces/225 grams bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped into chunks", "2 1/2 cups/150 grams mini marshmallows"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and arrange oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven.
