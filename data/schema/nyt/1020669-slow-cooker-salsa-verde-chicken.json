{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Salsa Verde Chicken", "description": "This spicy, saucy chicken takes almost no time to prep in the morning and only 5 minutes to finish before eating. At its simplest, the recipe is a meal-in-a-bowl stew, and the toppings are key to making it feel special. You could serve the chicken over rice or a whole grain, or use it as a taco or enchilada filling (use a slotted spoon to serve the chicken, if it is very saucy). You can also add 1 cup of frozen or fresh corn, or a drained 15-ounce can of black beans or pinto beans; just add them at the end along with the fresh cilantro and scallions. The level of heat in jarred salsas can vary, so taste yours first to ensure it is to your liking. If you want more spice, leave some of the jalape\u00f1o seeds in, or use hot canned green chiles instead of mild ones.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/25/dining/sd-slow-cooker-salsa-verde-chicken/sd-slow-cooker-salsa-verde-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, chilis, cilantro, cumin, garlic powder, lime, onion powder, salsa verde, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1340}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1 1/2 cups jarred salsa verde", "1 (4-ounce) can chopped mild green chiles", "8 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 jalape\u00f1o, stemmed, seeded and diced", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "3 scallions (green and white parts), thinly sliced", "1 small bunch cilantro, leaves and tender stems finely chopped (about 1 heaping cup)", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Fresh lime juice, to taste", "Any combination of rice, tortillas, pepitas, queso fresco, diced avocado and crushed tortilla chips, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the chicken thighs, salsa verde,\u00a0green chiles, chopped garlic, jalape\u00f1o, garlic powder, onion powder and cumin in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker.
