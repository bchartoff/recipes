{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso-Butter Roasted Broccoli", "description": "Deeply flavorful and easy, this simple roasted broccoli dish gets a finishing of miso butter and a hit of acidity from lime juice. It makes a great accompaniment to roasted salmon or chicken, and adds depth to grain bowls or quickly cooked leftovers. Although the recipe calls for room temperature butter, the butter only needs to be soft enough so that you can mash it together with the miso, as it will start to melt upon contact with the sheet pan. You can swap in ghee for the butter, or some lemon in place of the lime. Finish the dish with grated Parmesan for some extra flavor, if desired.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/13/dining/yf-miso-butter-broccoli/yf-miso-butter-broccoli-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "broccoli, lime juice, miso, sheet-pan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 439}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large head broccoli (about 1 to 1 \u00bc pounds), florets and tender stems cut into bite-size pieces (6 to 8 cups)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter or ghee, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons white miso", "1 lime, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the broccoli to a large sheet pan, along with any tiny stray pieces from the cutting board (they will get crunchy and browned).
