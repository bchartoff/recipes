{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ground Lamb Pulao", "description": "The aroma of fresh mint and spices permeates this bright, turmeric-painted pulao made with basmati rice and ground lamb. This recipe, which has origins in the ground meat pulaos of India, is quite flexible and open to additions: a handful of fresh dill, a generous sprinkling of fried peanuts or other nuts, or crispy, fried onions tossed in just before serving. It also works well if you substitute beef for the lamb, and  really needs no sides, except maybe some raita, creamy plain yogurt or a salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/13/dining/ns-ground-lamb/ns-ground-lamb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice, meat, main course", "keywords": "ginger, lamb, mint, rice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1018}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups basmati rice", "1 1/2 pounds ground lamb or beef", "1 teaspoon ghee, unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and grated", "2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger", "1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala", "1/2 teaspoon red chile powder", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3 tablespoons lime juice", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 bunch scallions (about 6), trimmed and thinly sliced", "1/4 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Check the rice and discard any debris.
