{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bulgur Bowl With Spinach, Mushrooms and Dukkah", "description": "This is a simple skillet supper, a bowl of bulgur topped with a savory mixture of mushrooms and spinach. It gets a final flourish of dukkah, a Middle Eastern seasoning made with toasted nuts (or in some places chickpea flour), seeds and spices that is as much a snack as it is a seasoning; a favorite way to eat dukkah is to dip vegetables or bread into olive oil and then into the dukkah. There are many versions of the mix. Ana Sortun, a chef at Oleana in Cambridge, Mass., and the author of \u201cSpices: Flavors of the Eastern Mediterranean,\u201d adds coconut to hers. The recipe for the dukkah makes more than you will need for this meal, but it keeps well (I keep mine in the freezer) and it is great to have on hand.<br/><br/>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/05/science/08recipehealth/08recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "coarse bulgur, mushroom, spinach, dairy-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, vegan, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 410, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "20 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1215 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup lightly toasted unsalted peanuts or almonds", "1/4 cup lightly toasted sesame seeds", "2 tablespoons coriander seeds", "1 tablespoon cumin seeds", "2 teaspoons nigella seeds", "1 teaspoon ground sumac", "1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)", "1 cup coarse bulgur (#3)  ", "2 cups water or stock (chicken or vegetable)", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus additional if desired for drizzling", "1/2 red onion, thinly sliced across the grain", "1 pound white, cremini or wild mushrooms, trimmed and quartered", "2 to 4 garlic cloves (to taste), minced", "2 tablespoons dry white wine (optional)", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 1/2 pounds bunch spinach, stemmed and washed, or 12 ounces baby spinach, washed", "1 cup cooked chickpeas", "1 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan.
