Thinly sliced butternut squash and broken dried lasagna noodles are all tossed together in one bowl with cheese, spices and a red pepper sauce, then pressed into a cake pan before baking, at which point everything softens and cooks together into imperfectly perfect layers. A simple b\u00e9chamel topping is made while your pie is in the oven, leaving you ample time to get on with assembling a big salad or a side dish of your choosing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/16/magazine/16mag-eat-site/16mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course", "keywords": "basil, butternut squash, coriander seed, cumin seed, feta, garlic, lasagna, lasagna noodle, parmesan, fall, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1231}, "recipeIngredient": ["\u00bc cup olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan", "8 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 tablespoon cumin seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar and pestle", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar and pestle", "2 teaspoons Aleppo chile flakes", "1 (12-ounce) jar red peppers, drained", "1 teaspoon light brown sugar", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "1 small butternut squash (about 1 \u00be pounds), peeled, halved, deseeded and cut into \u215b-inch-thick slices\u00a0", "8 ounces dried lasagna noodles, each roughly broken into 3 or 4 pieces", "7 ounces baby spinach (10 lightly packed cups)", "1 packed cup basil leaves, torn in halves", "1 cup crumbled Greek feta", "Heaping \u00bd cup finely grated Parmesan", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "\u2153 cup all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups whole milk, plus more if needed", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Fine sea salt", "1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pie: Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
