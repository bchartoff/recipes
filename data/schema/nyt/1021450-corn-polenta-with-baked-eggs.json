{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn Polenta With Baked Eggs", "description": "This baked polenta is an extremely adaptable pantry dinner, and it works just as well without a stash of summer corn. (Of course, if you carefully sliced some off, and froze them after the summer, feel free to use them here.) You can use just about any kind of hearty chopped green here, and any full flavored cheese such as feta, blue cheese, Parmesan or an aged Cheddar. The eggs round out the dish, but feel free to leave them out for a satisfying side dish.
