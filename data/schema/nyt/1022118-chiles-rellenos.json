{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chiles Rellenos", "description": "This recipe for chiles rellenos comes from Andrea Serrato, who sells an exquisite version of the dish out of her home in East Los Angeles. Ms. Serrato learned to make it from her mother, Rose Serrato, who fills big chile poblanos simply with queso ranchero, fries them in a cloudlike batter and simmers them in a garlicky salsa roja. Be sure to take your time charring the chiles on the flame to make sure they get evenly tender. The dish is time-consuming and labor-intensive, but extremely worthwhile \u2014 delicious, comforting and beautiful, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/25/magazine/25mag-eat/25mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 chiles", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "poblano chili, queso fresco, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 391}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 serrano chiles, stems removed", "6 beefsteak tomatoes (about 4 pounds)", "4 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1 white onion, peeled and sliced into thin rings", "6 large, firm poblano chiles (about 1 3/4 pounds)", "12 ounces queso fresco or low-moisture melting cheese, such as mozzarella", "5 large eggs, yolks and whites separated", "Canola oil, for frying", "2 cups all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the tomato salsa: Put a large pot of water on to boil.
