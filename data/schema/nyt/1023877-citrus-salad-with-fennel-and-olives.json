{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Citrus Salad With Fennel and Olives", "description": "An orange salad can be a simple affair. Add sliced oranges, a few black olives and a drizzle of oil, and it\u2019s a winning combination, known throughout the eastern Mediterranean, southern Italy and perhaps especially in Morocco. You can up the interest factor in any number of ways. Add thinly sliced fennel and red onion, some arugula, mint or basil leaves, a sprinkling of red pepper, a pinch of wild oregano or a little flaky salt. The salad needn\u2019t be restricted to only navel oranges. In season, blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges or grapefruit are welcome to join.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/01/multimedia/25tanisrex1-salad-zlfw/25tanisrex1-salad-zlfw-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "appetizer", "keywords": "fennel, grapefruit, olive, orange, salad, shallot, vegan, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 navel oranges", "4 blood oranges", "2 small ruby or Oro Blanco grapefruits", "2 large shallots or 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced into rings", "2 small fennel bulbs, trimmed and thinly sliced into rings", "1/4 cup pitted olives, Moroccan oil-cured black or Castelvetrano green olives", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste", "1 handful mint or basil leaves", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes, such as Marash", "Pinch of dried oregano, preferably wild", "Flaky salt, for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To peel the citrus fruit, using a small serrated knife, cut off a thin slice of peel from the top and bottom of the orange, so it sits flat and securely on the cutting board.
