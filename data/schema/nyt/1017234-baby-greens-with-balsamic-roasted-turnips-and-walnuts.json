{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baby Greens With Balsamic-Roasted Turnips and Walnuts", "description": "In spring I welcome tender raw turnips into my salads, but I use another approach in the winter. I took some medium-size turnips that had been lingering in my crisper for some weeks, tossed them with balsamic vinegar and olive oil and roasted them. They would make a fine side dish, but I had a salad in mind. I paired the roasted turnips with tender baby greens, walnuts and blue cheese. I have served the turnips warm with the salad and also after they cooled; I liked them best warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/14/science/recipehealthbabygreens/recipehealthbabygreens-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 5 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 50}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 283, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "373 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound turnips (3 medium), peeled and cut in wedges (about 1/2 inch wide at widest part)", "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 very small garlic clove, pur\u00e9ed", "1 tablespoon walnut oil", "5 cups baby salad greens (about 4 ounces)", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts", "1 ounce blue cheese, crumbled (1/4 cup)", "1 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs such as tarragon, parsley, chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
