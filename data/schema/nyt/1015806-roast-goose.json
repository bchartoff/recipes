{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Goose", "description": "Here is a bird that throws off a lot of beautiful fat in the oven. You will use some of it to cook the potatoes that go in the roasting pan for the final hour of cooking, but you will have taken off quite a bit before that as well. You can save that goose fat, covered, in the refrigerator for a few weeks, until the next time you want incredible roast potatoes. The British serve roast goose with a sauce of onions sauteed in goose fat, then stewed in milk and cream and thickened with old bread. But I prefer something tart rather than rich \u2014 a cranberry relish, for instance, sweetened but not overly so.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-ROASTEDBIRD/19COOKING-OVENROASTED-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 10 to 12.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, roasts", "keywords": "goose, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 193}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1086, "unsaturatedFatContent": "57 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "89 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "45 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "sodiumContent": "933 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole goose, approximately 12 pounds", "Kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "3 pounds small potatoes, ideally red or Yukon gold, peeled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse and dry the goose, rub it inside and out with salt and refrigerate \nuncovered for at least 6 hours, or overnight.
