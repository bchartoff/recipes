{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato and Apple Kugel", "description": "I\u2019ve looked at a number of sweet potato kugel recipes, and experimented with this one a few times until I was satisfied with it. The trick is to bake the kugel long enough so that the sweet potato softens properly without the top drying out and browning too much. I cover the kugel during the first 45 minutes of baking to prevent this. After you uncover it, it\u2019s important to baste the top every 5 to 10 minutes with melted butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/06/science/09recipehealth/09recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "apple, eggs, sweet potato, fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 449}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 144, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "274 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 eggs", "Salt to taste", "2 large sweet potatoes (1 3/4 to 2 pounds total), peeled and grated", "2 slightly tart apples, like Gala or Braeburn, peeled, cored and grated", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice", "1 tablespoon mild honey or agave nectar", "3 to 4 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
