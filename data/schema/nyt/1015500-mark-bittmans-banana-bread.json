One-fourth of the flour is whole wheat, which contributes a kind of depth you\u2019d miss if it weren\u2019t there. There are walnuts \u2014 not unusual, but again, you\u2019d miss them if they weren\u2019t there, And the key, secret ingredient, is coconut. Which really puts the thing over the top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/24/dining/24COOKING-BANANA-BREAD2/24COOKING-BANANA-BREAD2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "banana, bread, whole-wheat flour, dessert, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1350}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 283, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "205 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, plus some for greasing the pan", "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup whole wheat flour", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 cup sugar", "2 eggs", "3 very ripe bananas, mashed with a fork until smooth", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans", "1/2 cup grated dried unsweetened coconut"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
