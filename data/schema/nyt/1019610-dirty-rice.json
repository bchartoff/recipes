{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dirty Rice", "description": "Dirty rice gets its color from caramelized sirloin and the roux \u2014 flour browned (but not burned) in oil. The New Orleans-based chef Isaac Toups offers a 15-minute roux shortcut in his book \u201cChasing the Gator,\u201d but you may find your roux browns more quickly in the smoking hot oil. Be sure to stir, stir, stir once you add the flour. You cannot walk away from the pot while making this roux. Prep the \u201ctrinity\u201d \u2014 bell peppers, onion and celery \u2014 in advance as you won't have time to do it while the roux cooks. When the roux turns the color of milk chocolate, toss in the chopped vegetables to stop the roux from cooking any further. Instead of adding rice and the serving components, you could do as Mr. Toups suggests and use the meat gravy as a base for a lasagna ragu. Just throw in some fresh tomatoes and cook it down \u201cuntil it\u2019s nice and tight\u201d and make it your lasagna filling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/dining/toup-dirty-rice-horizontal/toup-dirty-rice-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "amber beer, grapeseed oil, ground sirloin, jasmine rice, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 115}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 456, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "556 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound lean ground sirloin", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 tablespoon grapeseed oil, or other neutral oil", "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne", "1/3 cup amber beer", "1/4 cup grapeseed oil, or other neutral oil", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup finely chopped white onion", "1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper", "1/3 cup finely chopped celery", "4 cloves garlic, crushed", "1/3 cup amber beer", "1 cup chicken stock, plus more as needed", "1 cup Louisiana jasmine or medium-grain white rice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 bay leaf", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 bunch scallions (green tops only), chopped", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sear the meat: Season the sirloin \u2014 just use it how it comes out of the tray from the grocery store \u2014 with 1 teaspoon of salt on each side."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it starts to smoke.
