{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Warm Lentil Salad With Balsamic Roast Squash", "description": "This recipe started out as something else. I had in my pantry a bag of mixed sprouted lentils \u2013 black, green, and brown. I cooked them with the intention of making dal, but I so liked the integrity of the cooked lentils \u2013 green and black lentils remain intact even after they soften \u2013 that I didn\u2019t want to mash them. Meanwhile I had roasted some squash with balsamic vinegar. I ended up warming the lentils in a cumin-scented vinaigrette and serving them with the squash.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/01/science/01recipehealth/01recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, lentils, spices, winter squash, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 150}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 295, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "870 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds kabocha or butternut squash, peeled and cut in small dice (about 3 cups peeled and diced, weighing 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds), or 1 large acorn squash, cut in half \n\n(If using acorn squash, place in a 425 degree oven for 20 minutes before cutting in ", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar (2 tablespoons if using acorn squash)", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 cup black lentils (also known as beluga lentils), green Le Puy lentils, or a mixture, rinsed", "1 teaspoon minced ginger", "1 teaspoon turmeric", "1/2 onion (intact)", "1 quart water", "Salt to taste", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, ground", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon walnut oil", "1/4 cup chopped or slivered flat leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the lentils, ginger, turmeric, onion, water, and salt to taste in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.
