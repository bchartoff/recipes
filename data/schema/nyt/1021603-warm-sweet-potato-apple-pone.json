{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Warm Sweet Potato-Apple Pone", "description": "Sweet potato pone is a baked custard pudding-like dish that\u2019s something like a crustless sweet potato pie. This version is made with whole shreds of sweet potato, which is how it\u2019s often served during the holidays throughout the Caribbean and parts of the American South. It\u2019s a versatile dessert that can be made with other warming spices like ginger, nutmeg or clove, a little orange zest, or even rum-soaked raisins. This is a simplified version that replaces half of the sweet potatoes with shredded apple, which adds natural sweetness and a bit of creaminess as it cooks down. Choose from baking varieties like Honeycrisp, Fuji or Gala. Serve the pone warm from the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/dining/jg-sweet-potato-pone/jg-sweet-potato-pone-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "apple, cinnamon, evaporated milk, sweet potato, fall, kwanzaa, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 487}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, plus 2 teaspoons for greasing", "1 medium sweet, crisp baking apple, such as Honeycrisp, Fuji or Gala", "1 teaspoon lemon juice", "1 medium sweet potato, peeled and shredded (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 cup evaporated milk", "1/4 packed cup/55 grams light brown sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams all-purpose flour", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Vanilla ice cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
