{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vichy Carrots", "description": "Vichy carrots are a dish in which the vegetables are cooked through in water with a little sugar on them to create a glaze. Historically, the excellence of this preparation derived from the quality of the spring water in Vichy, a resort town in central France. Jody Williams, the chef at Buvette in Greenwich Village, from whom this recipe is adapted, adds sherry vinegar to the water, along with, eventually, some honey, shallots and a pinch or two of fresh thyme. Who knows if the Vichyssoise would recognize the result. But served hot, room temperature or cold, they are some fantastic carrots.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/16/dining/16COOKBOOK/16COOKBOOK-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "carrot, healthy, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 328}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 151, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "357 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound carrots, young ones if possible, or older ones cut into lengths of around 1/2 inch by 2 inches, trimmed and peeled", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "2 tablespoons honey", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium-size shallot, peeled and finely diced", "1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped", "Black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put carrots in a saut\u00e9 pan, season aggressively with salt and add a tablespoon of the vinegar.
