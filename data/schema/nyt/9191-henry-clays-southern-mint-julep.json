{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Henry Clay's Southern Mint Julep", "description": "In an age devoted to convenience and speed, the julep throws up some major hurdles. Although it contains only three ingredients -- sugar, bourbon and mint -- it requires time and patience to make. The drink requires large quantities of crushed ice. To lay the foundation for the drink, it is first necessary to muddle the sugar with a little bourbon and a few mint leaves. It should be served with two straws and garnished with a nice bush of mint, sprinkled with a little powdered sugar, please. And of course, you'll want to serve your juleps in a silver or pewter mug.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "William Grimes"}, "image": null, "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "bourbon, mint, sugar, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 6}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 fresh red-stemmed mint leaves", "1 teaspoon sugar", "2 ounces bourbon", "Cracked ice", "1 bunch mint", "Fresh water", "Carbonated water", "Lemon zest", "Powdered sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a tall crystal tumbler, gently bruise the 12 mint leaves, and muddle with sugar and a dash of bourbon."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill the glass halfway with cracked ice, and agitate with a spoon."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pack the rest of the glass with ice and fill with the rest of the bourbon and equal parts fresh water and carbonated water."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Garnish with mint sprig.
