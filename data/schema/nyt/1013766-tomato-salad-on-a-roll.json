{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tomato Salad on a Roll", "description": "This sandwich, a delight of summer, is a cross between the pan bagnat from Nice and the Catalan tomato bread with anchovy. And it's dead simple. Tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, capers, anchovy and basil. A splash of red wine vinegar. This sandwich comes together quickly, but the ingredients need to stay inside the loaf for at least an hour. That way, the juicy tomatoes and all the tasty aromatics permeate the bread in a soggy, heavenly way. Eat it outside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/28/dining/tomatosandwich-still/tomatosandwich-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, quick, salads and dressings, sandwiches", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, french baguette, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 197}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 220, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "391 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ripe tomatoes, in assorted colors and sizes", "Salt", "pepper", "2 garlic cloves, finely minced", "2 anchovy fillets, rinsed and roughly chopped, optional", "1 teaspoon capers, rinsed", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons red wine vinegar", "Pinch red pepper flakes", "12 basil leaves", "A few tender parsley leaves", "4 fresh French rolls or a long baguette"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut larger tomatoes in thick slices or wedges and smaller ones into halves, and put them in a salad bowl.
