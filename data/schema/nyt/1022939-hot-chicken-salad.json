{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hot Chicken Salad", "description": "This quintessential American casserole epitomizes timeless comfort food. The \u201chot\u201d in this chicken salad refers to temperature, not spice. This casserole takes the components of a classic chicken salad, tops it off with crunchy classic potato chips and bakes in the oven until warmed through. While the filling and toppings vary by region and recipe, the main ingredients, like the version here, include cooked chicken, celery, mayonnaise, grated cheese and slivered almonds. You can poach your own chicken or save time and use a cut up rotisserie or poached chicken. Hot chicken salad does precisely what is asked of a casserole: to soothe, lift up and spread joy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/02/dining/31CHICKENSALADREX/merlin_196270143_d11445c8-39fd-415a-9ab4-83166985a631-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 666}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds cooked chicken, cut into 1-inch pieces", "5 large celery stalks, cut into 1/2-inch slices at an angle", "1 cup mayonnaise", "1 cup grated sharp Cheddar (3 ounces)", "1/2 cup slivered almonds", "2 tablespoons lemon juice\u00a0", "1 teaspoon onion salt\u00a0", "Salt and black pepper", "4 cups potato chips (classic or ruffled), lightly crushed, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees with a rack positioned in the center.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the chicken, celery, mayonnaise, Cheddar, almonds, lemon juice and onion salt in a large bowl and mix to combine well.
