{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom Pasta Stir-Fry", "description": "While stir-fries have long gone hand-in-hand with rice, this recipe shows the versatility of the dish. Here, a quick stir-fry is transformed into a flavorful, unconventional pasta sauce. <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021925-five-spice\">Five spice</a> is a Chinese seasoning that is said to incorporate all five tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. In this recipe, its blend of star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, Sichuan peppercorns and fennel intensifies the robust flavor of the mushrooms. Don\u2019t overcook the broccolini; it should be crisp, with a bright green vibrancy. You could easily substitute broccoli, green beans, snow peas or other crunchy greens. And don\u2019t skip the butter (or use vegan butter, if you prefer), as it provides a beautiful richness which brings the sauce and ingredients together.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/25/dining/hm-pasta-stir-fry/hm-pasta-stir-fry-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "broccolini, chile crisp, five-spice powder, mushroom, oyster sauce, spaghetti", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1857}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound spaghetti or other long pasta", "4 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed", "1 pound mushrooms (any small variety), trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "1 1/4 teaspoons five-spice blend", "3/4 pound broccolini, trimmed and cut into 3-inch pieces, thick stems halved lengthwise", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons oyster sauce (or vegetarian mushroom oyster sauce)", "2 tablespoons maple syrup or brown sugar", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 tablespoon chile oil or chile crisp"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
