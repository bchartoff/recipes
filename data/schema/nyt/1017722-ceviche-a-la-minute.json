His recipe is one of astonishingly pared-down simplicity and speed. He demonstrated it on a recent trip to New York, filleting a seven-pound fluke he had bought that morning in Chinatown, mixing ingredients and setting the finished dish out on a platter at Raymi, a Peruvian restaurant in Chelsea. The entire process took all of five minutes. That\u2019s not counting slicing onions and squeezing lime juice; he had helpers for that. So at home you may have to allocate a mighty 10 minutes. \u201cOver the years, it\u2019s become simpler and simpler,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could leave off another ingredient I would.\u201d It\u2019s important to serve it just as soon as it\u2019s ready.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/28/dining/28CEVICHE/28CEVICHE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "south american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, fluke, lime juice, onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 59}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 70, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "285 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound skinless fluke fillets", "1 1/3 cups red onion sliced paper-thin", "1/3 cup fresh lime juice", "1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste", "Black pepper, to taste", "1 habanero chile, seeded and finely minced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut fish in 1-inch chunks.
