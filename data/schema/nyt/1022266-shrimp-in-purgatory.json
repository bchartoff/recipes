{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shrimp in Purgatory", "description": "This one-skillet shrimp dish is inspired by the bright flavors of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019109-eggs-in-purgatory\">eggs in purgatory</a>, the classic Southern Italian dish in which eggs simmer in a spicy tomato sauce. The exact origins of the name are uncertain, but many say the sauce is meant to represent purgatory, and the eggs, souls. Here, shrimp stand in for the eggs, and the tomato sauce is rich and tangy, with roasted red peppers and capers. You can use frozen shrimp; just defrost them first. Serve the shrimp in shallow bowls, with crusty bread, or over orzo, couscous or polenta.
