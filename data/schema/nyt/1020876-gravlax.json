{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gravlax", "description": "I think of making my own gravlax \u2014 the Nordic sugar-salt cured salmon \u2014 as the gentle, blue-square cooking analog of an intermediate ski trail: It\u2019s mostly easy, but requires some experience. While butchering a whole salmon and cold smoking what you\u2019ve butchered are also exhilarating milestones in the life of an advancing home cook (both a little farther up the mountain and a little steeper on the run down), buying a nice fillet and burying it in salt, sugar and a carpet of chopped fresh dill for a few days is a great confidence-building day on the slopes, so to speak. The cured gravlax will last a solid five days once sliced, in the refrigerator. If a whole side of salmon is more than you need at once, the rest freezes very satisfactorily.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/23/magazine/23mag-eat/23mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P5DT30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings (about 3 pounds)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, seafood", "keywords": "dill, pumpernickel, salmon, shallot, sugar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 207}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 side clean, fresh and fat Alaskan king salmon, skin on, pin bones removed, neatly trimmed of all undesirable bits of fat and tissue (about 3 to 3 1/2 pounds total), or 1 fat and gorgeous 2 1/2-pound fillet cut from the widest part of the body", "1/2 cup kosher salt", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/4 cup finely ground black pepper", "2 bunches dill (about 4 ounces each), clean and dry, left intact (no need to pick fronds from stem), coarsely chopped (about 2 cups)", "1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks), left at room temperature for an hour (not hard from the fridge yet not so warm as to be greasy)", "1 bunch dill (about 4 ounces), clean and dry, fronds removed from stems, fronds finely chopped (about 3/4 cup)", "1 medium shallot, peeled and finely minced", "3 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "Soft dark pumpernickel sandwich bread"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cure the salmon: Lay salmon skin-side down, flesh-side up in a glass or stainless-steel baking dish.
