{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gluten-Free Cornmeal Molasses Muffins", "description": "Strong molasses provides a good source of iron in an easy-to-make muffin. <br/><br/>One of my favorite breads is a steamed brown bread called Boston brown bread. It is made with cornmeal and flour, and is the inspiration for these muffins, which are easier to make. The strong molasses, which is a good source of iron, flavor will mask the bean flavor of commercial gluten free mixes, so feel free to use one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/29/science/01recipehealth/01recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins (1/3 cup tins)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, cornmeal, ginger, molasses, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 45}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 179, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "211 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["140 grams (approximately 1 cup) cornmeal", "140 grams (approximately 1 cup) whole grain gluten-free mix or all-purpose gluten-free mix", "35 grams (approximately 1/4 cup) soy flour or additional all-purpose gluten-free mix", "2 7/10 grams (1 teaspoon) ground ginger", "10 grams (2 teaspoons) baking powder", "5 grams (1 teaspoon) baking soda", "3 1/2 grams (rounded 1/2 teaspoon) salt", "2 eggs", "240 grams (1 cup) plain low-fat yogurt or buttermilk", "175 grams (1/2 cup) blackstrap molasses", "5 grams (1 teaspoon) vanilla", "75 grams (1/3 cup) canola or grape seed oil", "75 grams (1/2 cup) raisins (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees with a rack in the middle.
