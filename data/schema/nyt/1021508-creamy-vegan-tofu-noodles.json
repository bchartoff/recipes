{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Vegan Tofu Noodles", "description": "There is no need to reserve this recipe exclusively for vegans: This noodle dish will win over any crowd, regardless of dietary dispositions. Here, tofu is blended with garlic, five-spice powder and water for a creamy yet weightless sauce that wraps around each noodle. The same technique can be used to create a lush dairy-free pasta sauce (just add nutritional yeast and fresh herbs) or a ranch-like dip (blitz silken tofu with garlic, onion powder and herbs). For this recipe, be sure to use firm tofu, as it has more body and makes for a heartier sauce. The creamy noodles provide the perfect backdrop for the spicy, punchy black vinegar sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/08/dining/hm-tofu-noodles/merlin_180213513_4ffbdd61-1afd-4515-91be-28125b677999-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, tofu, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2074}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "12 ounces thick Chinese wheat noodles", "1 (14-ounce) package firm tofu, broken into pieces", "2 garlic cloves, sliced", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder", "1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus a few sprigs for serving", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "Toasted white sesame seeds, for garnish", "2 tablespoons Chinkiang vinegar (black vinegar), or a combination of 4 teaspoons rice wine vinegar plus 2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon chile oil or chile crisp, such as Chiu Chow chile oil", "1 scallion, finely chopped", "1 (1/2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
