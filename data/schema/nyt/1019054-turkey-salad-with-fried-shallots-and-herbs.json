{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Salad With Fried Shallots and Herbs", "description": "This recipe is adapted from Naomi Duguid's chicken salad in \"Burma: Rivers of Flavor.\" It incorporates shallots two ways, raw and fried, as well as the deeply savory oil used to fry them. Bright with lime juice, the raw heat of a green chile and plenty of fresh herbs, it's excellent plain, or with some chopped cucumber and lettuce beneath it, for crunch. As Ms. Duguid points out in the book, it's a dressing that can be applied to refresh all manner of leftovers, from the roasted turkey you're left with the day after Thanksgiving, to the roasted vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/22/dining/22Leftovers-web2/22Leftovers-web2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "coriander, jalape\u00f1o, lime, mint, shallot, turkey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 278, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "370 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups thinly sliced shallots", "4 tablespoons peanut oil", "2 cups leftover cooked turkey meat, pulled into bite-size pieces", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and minced", "Handful of cilantro and mint leaves, torn"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Divide the sliced shallots: Soak 1/3 cup of the shallots in cold water for about 10 minutes; drain through a mesh sieve and set aside.
