{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Peach Crumble", "description": "This crumble lets peaches shine, with just a little lemon to brighten and brown sugar to help them caramelize as they soften in the oven. The crisp, toasty topping is full of texture from both nuts and oats, and is clumped in various sizes, so each bite is different from the next. Eat the crumble warm or at room temperature on its own, with a pour of nut milk or with a scoop of vegan ice cream or tart sorbet, like lemon or raspberry. Leftovers right from the fridge make a great breakfast with a spoonful of vegan yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/12/dining/as-vegan-peach-crumble/merlin_208558608_c2772910-b6cf-4849-861d-a95b904a89c3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "almond, coconut oil, oats, peach, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 416}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds ripe peaches (about 6 to 9), pitted and cut into 1/3-inch-thick slices", "2/3 cup/142 grams packed light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/4 cups/150 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon lemon zest\u00a0", "1/2 cup/43 grams sliced raw almonds or coarsely chopped pistachios, walnuts or pecans\u00a0", "1/3 cup/30 grams old-fashioned oats", "1/2 cup refined coconut oil or vegan butter, melted and cooled slightly", "2 teaspoons cornstarch or tapioca starch"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
