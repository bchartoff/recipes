{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Hummingbird Cake", "description": "This magnificent version of the popular banana-pineapple-pecan cake developed by Southern Living magazine in 1978 is adapted from the chef Ashley Christensen's cookbook, \"Poole's: Recipes from a Modern Diner.\" It is a Thanksgiving-worthy dessert for the pie averse: a supremely moist, dense cake crowded with sweet potato, roasted bananas, pineapple, currants and green peanuts (if you live north of the Mason-Dixon line, the plain, roasted variety work just fine). A lightly sweet, butter-cream cheese frosting finishes it off. Set aside a solid afternoon for this project cake, as you have to roast the bananas and grate the sweet potato, and the assembly takes some patience and agility \u2014 but it is well worth the toil. This recipe is for a towering three-layer version (get out your biggest mixing bowls), but you could just make a more modest, but still generously sized, two-layer cake instead. To do so, cut all of the ingredients in half (use just 2 eggs); divide the batter between two 8-inch round cake pans; and bake at the same time and temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/hummingbirdcake/hummingbirdcake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch, 3-layer cake", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cream cheese, currants, peanut, pineapple, sweet potato, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 335}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 large bananas", "Nonstick cooking spray", "4 1/2 cups/563 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "2 cups/400 grams sugar", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "5 large eggs", "2 cups/473 milliliters neutral vegetable oil", "28 ounces/794 grams canned pineapple chunks, drained and chopped (3 cups)", "1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract", "1 cup/160 grams dried black currants", "2 cups/300 grams green peanuts (or use roasted, unsalted peanuts)", "2 pounds/907 grams sweet potatoes, peeled (about 3 medium)", "2 (8-ounce/227 gram) packages cream cheese, at room temperature", "4 sticks/452 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3 3/4 cups/454 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar (one 1-pound box)", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "2 cups/300 grams roasted, salted peanuts (such as cocktail peanuts), roughly chopped, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees (or 400 degrees convection).
