{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlicky Hasselback Sweet Potatoes", "description": "Tender in the middle, with charred ruffles on top, hasselback potatoes \u2014 sliced thinly all the way through so that they fan open like an accordion \u2014 are the ultimate treat for people who can\u2019t choose between creamy and crisp. In this recipe, the sweet potatoes are halved first, so they cook faster and so their flat sides sear in the hot pan, leaving a caramelized edge. If your spice cabinet is fully stocked, try adding red-pepper flakes, smoked paprika or dried oregano to your garlic-butter mixture. A sprinkling of chopped parsley, right before you\u2019re ready to eat, would also be welcome. Serve these as you would roasted potatoes, like alongside roast chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Jampel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/21/dining/sj-hasselback-pots/sj-hasselback-pots-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "\u00a04 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, winter, garlic, sweet potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 185}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 184, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "333 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil", "2 medium sweet potatoes (about 8 to 10 ounces each), scrubbed and dried", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 garlic cloves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
