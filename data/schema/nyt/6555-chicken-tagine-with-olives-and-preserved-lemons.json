{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Tagine With Olives and Preserved Lemons", "description": "This rich and fragrant chicken stew is laden with complex flavors and spices reminiscent of the sort you might encounter in a mountainside cafe in Morocco. Save yourself the cost of a plane ticket, however, and make this at home. First, rub the chicken with a redolent combination of garlic, saffron, ground ginger, paprika, cumin, turmeric and black pepper, then pop it into the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours to marinate. Once that's done, brown the chicken parts, and remove from the pan, making room for a pile of sliced onions that you'll saut\u00e9 until golden brown. Nestle a cinnamon stick into the tangle of onions, pile the chicken parts on top and scatter with slices of preserved lemons and olives, a combination of green and kalamata. Add a bit of chicken stock and lemon juice, then cook over low heat until the chicken is cooked through, and your house smells amazing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/27/dining/27COOKING-CHICKENTAGINE1/27COOKING-CHICKENTAGINE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean, moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "calamata olives, chicken, cinnamon stick, green olives, lemon juice, poultry, preserved lemon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1026}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 628, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "46 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "874 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, pulverized", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon turmeric", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 chicken, cut in 8 to 10 pieces", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "3 medium onions, sliced thin", "1 cinnamon stick", "8 calamata olives, pitted and halved", "8 cracked green olives, pitted and halved", "1 large or 3 small preserved lemons (sold in specialty food shops)", "1 cup chicken stock", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix garlic, saffron, ginger, paprika, cumin and turmeric together.
