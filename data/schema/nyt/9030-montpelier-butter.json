{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Montpelier Butter", "description": "\"One of my favorite recipes in the whole book ('Jeremiah Tower Cooks') is for Montpelier butter -- it's the best version I've ever tried and incredibly versatile. In 'New American Classics,' Tower wrote that this classic compound butter 'transforms hot cauliflower' and that 'on top of mashed potatoes it is so good that it should be arrested.' Here he says he hasn't changed his mind and further recommends it with hot grilled fish or steaks and, at room temperature, with cold poached salmon. With typical passion, he adds that when it is spooned between slices of leftover roast pork or veal 'the slices reassembled, left for a day, and then eaten at cool room temperature, it creates a lifelong memory.'\"", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Reed"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 1/2 to 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, condiments", "keywords": "eggs, herbs, spinach, raw, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 271, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "165 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 leaves spinach", "Leaves from 1/2 bunch watercress (1 1/2 cups of leaves)", "2 tablespoons fresh flat parsley leaves", "2 tablespoons fresh chervil leaves", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives", "1 tablespoon fresh tarragon leaves", "2 shallots, chopped", "2 cornichons, rinsed and chopped", "4 anchovy fillets", "2 tablespoons capers", "1 garlic clove, peeled", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "3 hard-cooked egg yolks", "2 large raw egg yolks", "1/4 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into 1-tablespoon pieces", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon white-wine vinegar", "Salt and freshly ground white pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Blanch the spinach, watercress, herbs and shallots in boiling water for 1 minute.
