It\u2019s blissfully easy. Melt some butter in a skillet (cast iron, if you have it), mix together a pancake-type batter in a bowl, toss with fruit and bake. Raw fruit in this recipe bakes up juicy with a firm yet yielding bite that is not at all mushy. (Keeping the skins helps that.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/-Brown-Butter-Nectarine-Cobbler/-Brown-Butter-Nectarine-Cobbler-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 288}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 225, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "150 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups fresh nectarines or peaches in 1/2-inch slices, or a combination about 1 pound", "5 ounces sugar (about 3/4 cup)", "1 teaspoon lemon juice", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 ounces flour (about 3/4 cup)", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "3/4 cup buttermilk", "1/4 cup sliced almonds", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "2 tablespoons Demerara sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
