{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ground Beef Chili With Chocolate and Peanut Butter", "description": "Making use of a well-stocked pantry, this weeknight chili takes inspiration from the flavor profile of mole negro, an Oaxacan sauce made with chiles and chocolate that traditionally takes a full day to make, but results in a pot full of depth and nuance in less than an hour. It relies upon ground beef or turkey, and uses canned chiles in adobo, paprika and ancho chili powder for heat, plus a mix of warm spices, chocolate in two forms, and a little bit of peanut butter to round it out. In essence, this recipe is another variation of the combination of sweet and heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Aaron Hutcherson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/05/dining/ah-ground-beef-chili/merlin_181550151_bb82fcea-8242-4fa6-a712-7c984eb33155-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, one pot, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "adobo sauce, beer, chocolate, ground beef, ground turkey, paprika, peanut butter, pinto beans, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2156}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 medium yellow onion, diced (about 8 ounces)", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "3 canned chiles in adobo, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "2 teaspoons ancho chile powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano, preferably Mexican", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "2 pounds ground beef or ground dark turkey", "1 (15-ounce) can petite diced tomatoes", "1 cup stout beer", "1 cup unsalted or low-sodium beef stock or chicken stock", "2 (15-ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed", "4 ounces good dark chocolate, chopped", "2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter", "Any combination of tortilla chips, shredded cheese and diced avocado, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium.
