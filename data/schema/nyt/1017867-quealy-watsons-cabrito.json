You could make this dish with a single goat leg or a pork butt or even a brisket. The idea is simply to get a lot of smoke on the meat, then wrap it and allow it to steam slowly into perfection over time. Serve over brown paper on a big table with lots of tortillas and salsas: Tear away what you need for a taco, then repeat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/30/magazine/quealys-watsons-cabrito/quealys-watsons-cabrito-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "15 to 20 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "goat", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 17}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 497, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "91 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1048 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small goat, 15 to 20 pounds", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup dried avocado leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Light a charcoal grill or smoker, or heat oven to 250.
