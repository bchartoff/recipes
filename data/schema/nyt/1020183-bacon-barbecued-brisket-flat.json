{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bacon-Barbecued Brisket Flat", "description": "Packer brisket is what you order at a barbecue restaurant. The brisket flat (the leaner, flatter of the two muscles that comprise a whole brisket) is what you\u2019re more likely to find at the supermarket. Lacking the generous marbling of a packer, the flat tends to toughen and dry out during a long slow cook on your grill or smoker. But two simple techniques deliver a moist, tender brisket flat every time. The first is to cook the flat in a foil pan to shield the lean meat from the heat. The second is to drape the brisket flat with a layer of bacon, which renders its fat during cooking, basting the meat and keeping it moist. Then there\u2019s the bonus: You get to eat barbecued bacon along with your brisket.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/29/dining/24brisketrex1/24brisketrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "barbecues, meat, project", "keywords": "bacon, brisket, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 29}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (4- to 5-pound) brisket flat with at least a 1/4-inch layer of fat on top", "Coarse sea salt", "Cracked or freshly ground pepper", "Red-pepper flakes (optional)", "12 thick-cut bacon slices (about 12 ounces)", "Sliced white bread or brioche buns, for serving", "Barbecue sauce (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the brisket in a 9-by-13-inch disposable aluminum foil drip pan and generously season the top, bottom and sides of the brisket with salt, pepper and, if you like your brisket spicy, red-pepper flakes.
