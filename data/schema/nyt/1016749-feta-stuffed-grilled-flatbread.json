Feel free to use this recipe as a jumping off point for your own stuffings. The honeyed, whole-wheat-flecked dough works especially well with strong flavors like olives, capers, anchovies and other cheeses. Or skip the stuffing and grill up this dough all by itself. The basil oil makes a great dipping sauce with both stuffed and unstuffed flatbreads.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/14/multimedia/clark-flatbread/clark-flatbread-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, sandwiches", "keywords": "basil, feta, oregano, whole wheat flour, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 176}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 498, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "353 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon/5 milliliters honey", "2 teaspoons/7 grams active dry yeast (1 packet)", "3 cups/375 grams whole-wheat flour", "2 1/2 teaspoons/13 grams fine sea salt, more as needed", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters plain yogurt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters, plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, more for brushing", "2 to 3 cups/250 to 375 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed", "1 cup/50 grams fresh basil leaves", "2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "1/2 cup/30 grams fresh oregano leaves", "1 cup/130 grams crumbled feta cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk together 2 cups warm water and the honey.
