Let the onions slowly caramelize \u2014 don\u2019t hasten the cooking by jacking up the heat \u2014 and you will be rewarded with a haunting savory-sweet tart in the end that is still irresistible decades later, the very definition of an enduring classic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/08/magazine/08mag-Eat/08mag-Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pies and tarts, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "butter, heavy cream, nutmeg, pepper, yellow onion, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 948}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into thumbnail cubes", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters ice-cold water", "1 pound yellow onions", "2 tablespoons rendered bacon fat or lard", "1 large egg", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Freshly grated nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Blend flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor.
