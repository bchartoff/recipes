It\u2019s an extravagant treat. Pork leg with the skin attached (fresh ham) is the cut of meat traditionally used, but pork shoulder or belly also offers the delicious balance of fat and lean meat. The eggs lend an interesting contrast of chewy white and buttery yolk, while the sauce featuring coconut water is softly sweet. Searing the meat and including peppercorns are modern touches that induce greater complexity.

Warm the oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in 2 or 3 batches, cook the pork on all sides until lightly browned, about 1 minute per batch, holding the seared meat on a plate. When done, return all the pork and any accumulated juices to the pot, then add the caramel sauce, fish sauce, onion, garlic, peppercorns and coconut water. Bring to a boil over high heat, skim the scum, then adjust the heat to maintain a simmer.

If peppercorns cling to the pork, leave them for zing, or knock them off and discard. To quickly filter and remove fat from the cooking liquid, set a mesh strainer over a large heatproof bowl, line with a double layer of paper towels and pour the liquid through. After most of the liquid passes through and a layer of fat remains above the solids, set the strainer aside. (Save the fat for cooking if you like.) You should have about 1 1/2 cups cooking liquid."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Return the liquid to the pot, bring to a boil over high heat and cook until reduced to 1 cup, about 5 minutes.

Turn off the heat and let rest 5 minutes, uncovered, to concentrate flavors. Taste and add up to 1 1/2 teaspoons of fish sauce or 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, or both, as needed for a pleasant savory-sweet finish. Transfer to a shallow bowl for serving. Invite diners to halve the eggs themselves. If you\u2019d like spicy heat, gently smash the chiles in individual dishes for dipping sauce with some sauce from the pot, and use it to dip the pork and egg or to drizzle into the bowls."}], "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021833-thit-heo-kho-trung-pork-and-eggs-in-caramel-sauce"}
