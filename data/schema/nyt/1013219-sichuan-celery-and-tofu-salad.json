{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sichuan Celery and Tofu Salad", "description": "This otherwise simple salad, adapted from a dish at Szechuan Gourmet in Manhattan, may require a trip to a Chinese market for Szechuan peppercorns and pressed tofu. And you\u2019ll need to make your own chili oil! But here\u2019s the thing. The effort, which really isn\u2019t much more than difficult shopping, produces an elegant dish that is worth whatever shoe leather or mileage you\u2019ll expend getting the ingredients together. It is astonishingly good. And we\u2019ll even allow one substitution. You can use regular celery instead of the Chinese version!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/tofusalad-still/tofusalad-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, chinese", "recipeCategory": "quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "chinese celery, tofu, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 51}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 554, "unsaturatedFatContent": "44 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "57 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "361 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup peanut oil", "1 piece ginger, 2 inches long, cut into 3 or 4 slices", "1 piece cinnamon, 3 inches long", "3 cloves", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "4 star anise", "1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns", "1/4 cup red chile flakes, or more to taste", "Salt", "1 bunch Chinese celery, or regular celery, thinly sliced", "4 to 6 ounces pressed tofu, thinly sliced or julienned"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; when it simmers, add ginger, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, star anise, Sichuan peppercorns and chili flakes.
