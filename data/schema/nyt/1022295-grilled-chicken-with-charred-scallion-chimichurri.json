{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Chicken With Charred-Scallion Chimichurri", "description": "Bright and tangy chimichurri gets a deep smoky hit from charred scallions. This entire weeknight meal is prepared on the grill, taking advantage of tender chicken cutlets that cook up in just 5 minutes. Grilling lettuce brings out its inherent sweetness, and here, romaine gets caramelized on the outside to complement cool, crisp centers.
