Feel free to make this pie your own by playing around with the herbs and spices. You can also veganize it by leaving out the feta and using a vegan-friendly puff pastry. Typically used as a marinade or condiment, chermoula is a North African spice paste with a multitude of variations. Here, it is used twice, once to flavor the base and then again as a sauce to drizzle alongside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/23/dining/18ottorex/merlin_177011004_d3aa8556-f82e-4e68-9ccd-26e929bf2a42-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pies and tarts, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cilantro, dill, feta, frozen spinach, potato, puff pastry, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 692}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "3/4 cup/30 grams roughly chopped fresh cilantro (coriander)", "1/2 fresh mild red chile (about 10 grams), roughly chopped, seeds and all", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and roughly crushed using a mortar and pestle", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 tablespoons/60 milliliters olive oil", "4 tablespoons/60 milliliters olive oil", "1 large yellow onion (about 12 ounces/360 grams), halved and thinly sliced", "12 ounces/350 grams frozen spinach, thawed, then squeezed to remove excess water", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/3 cup/15 grams roughly chopped fresh dill", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon zest, plus 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice", "All-purpose flour, for dusting", "1 sheet frozen all-butter puff pastry, at least 9 inches/24 centimeters wide, thawed", "1 cup/130 grams roughly crumbled Greek feta", "1 baking potato (about 9 ounces/250 grams), skin-on, scrubbed clean"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chermoula paste: Add the garlic, cilantro, chile, cumin, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, a good grind of pepper and 3 tablespoons oil to a food processor.
