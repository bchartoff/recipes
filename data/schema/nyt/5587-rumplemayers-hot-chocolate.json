{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rumplemayer\u2019s Hot Chocolate", "description": "Hot chocolate is traceable to the Aztecs, who regarded the dark and bitter drink as a sacred brew. The hot cocoa that Columbus offered his patrons tasted \u201cbitter, scummy and peppery,\u201d according to Chantal Coady's account in \u201cThe Chocolate Companion,\u201d which explains, no doubt, why they disliked it intensely. Sometime later, Cortez offered the same beverage to Charles V and his courtiers and succeeded in capturing their imagination with the addition, Ms. Coady writes, of some sugar and vanilla. This version, adapted from Rumplemayer's, a now-closed New York restaurant once known for its hot chocolate and pastries, falls into the latter camp; it is rich, sweet and smooth. It calls for real semisweet chocolate (we bet a mix of semisweet and bittersweet would be delightful, too) so there's none of the chalky aftertaste hot cocoa often leaves behind. A dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon, if you wish, take it over the top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/07/dining/07COOKING-RUMPELMAYERS-HOTCHOC2/07COOKING-RUMPELMAYERS-HOTCHOC2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "milk, semisweet chocolate, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 187}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 460, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "111 milligrams", "sugarContent": "58 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups milk", "6 tablespoons sugar", "7 ounces semisweet chocolate,chopped", "1 cup heavy cream (optional)", "Ground cinnamon, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the milk, sugar and chocolate in a large saucepan.
