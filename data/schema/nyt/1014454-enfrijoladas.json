{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Enfrijoladas", "description": "This is one simple dish you can make if you have corn tortillas in the freezer and black beans in the pantry. Enfrijoladas are comforting enchiladas made by drenching corn tortillas in creamy, coarsely pureed black beans, folding them into quarters, and serving them in more of the black bean sauce. The authentic ones are garnished with Mexican queso fresco, but they are delicious without cheese. Cilantro or epazote is optional \u2013 I didn\u2019t have any; it is the black beans that make this dish what it is.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/01/science/04recipehealth/04recipehealth-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "black beans, corn tortillas, fresh herbs, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 120}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 369, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "72 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "378 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound (1 1/8 cups) black beans, washed, picked over and soaked for 4 to 6 hours or overnight in 1 quart water", "1 onion, cut in half", "2 plump garlic cloves, minced", "1 to 2 sprigs epazote or 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, plus additional for garnish (optional)", "1 to 2 teaspoons ground cumin, to taste", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground mild chili powder (more to taste)", "Salt to taste", "12 corn tortillas", "1/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large soup pot or Dutch oven combine the black beans with their soaking water (they should be submerged by at least 1 1/2 inches of water; add if necessary), one half of the onion, and half the garlic and bring to a boil.

Spoon about 1/2 cup of the hot, thick beans over the bottom of a large lightly oiled baking dish or serving platter. Using tongs, dip a softened tortilla into the beans and flip over to coat both sides with black beans. Remove from the beans and place on the baking dish or platter (this is messy; have the serving dish right next to the pot.) Fold into quarters. Use the tongs to do this, and if you find that the tortilla tears too much, then just coat one side with the black beans, transfer to the baking dish and spoon some of the black beans over the other side, then fold into quarters. Continue with the remaining tortillas, arranging the quartered bean-coated tortillas in overlapping rows. When all of the tortillas are in the dish, spoon the remaining black bean sauce over the top. Drain and rinse the onions, dry briefly on paper towels and sprinkle over the bean sauce. Garnish with cilantro and chopped walnuts if desired and serve at once."}]}
