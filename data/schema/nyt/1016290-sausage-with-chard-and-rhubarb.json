{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sausage With Chard and Rhubarb", "description": "This quick sausage dish is perfect for spring. The dark green chard adds freshness, while the rhubarb lends a citrus-like sour note that cuts through the richness of the sausages. If you don\u2019t have any mustard seeds on hand, leave them out. While they do add a pleasant heat and gentle crunch, you won\u2019t miss them if you didn\u2019t know they were supposed to be there. Use any kind of sausage you like here: pork, duck, lamb or turkey all work well with the rhubarb and greens.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/28/dining/28takeaway/28takeaway-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, lunch, quick, weekday", "keywords": "main course, rhubarb, sausage, swiss chard", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 354}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 991, "unsaturatedFatContent": "54 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "86 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "sodiumContent": "2147 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound hot Italian sausage (pork or turkey)", "1 shallot, finely chopped", "1 1/2 teaspoons mustard seeds", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1/2 cup thinly sliced rhubarb", "1 pound red or white Swiss chard, center ribs removed and leaves chopped", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground pepper, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm oil.
