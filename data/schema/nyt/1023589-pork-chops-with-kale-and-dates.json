For browned outsides, evenly cooked insides and fewer splatters, cook them over moderate heat and flip often. Use this method for basic pork chops, or continue with the recipe for a tangy and bittersweet tumble of kale, dates, garlic and vinegar inspired by bittersweet meat dishes like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021834-suon-kho-pork-ribs-in-savory-caramel-sauce\"> suon kho</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022337-spicy-citrus-skirt-steak\">orange beef</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022799-root-beer-ham\"> root beer-glazed ham</a>. Instead of kale, use another bitter green like escarole or radicchio, but keep the dates, which contribute a sweetness far more nuanced than straight sugar.
