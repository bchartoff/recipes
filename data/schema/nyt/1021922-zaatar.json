{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Za\u2019atar", "description": "Za\u2019atar is the name for both a traditional Middle Eastern seasoning blend and the pungent green herb that gives the blend its intense, earthy character. The hardy herb, which grows wild, tastes like a combination of oregano, marjoram, summer savory and thyme \u2014 all of which can be used as substitutes if dried za\u2019atar isn\u2019t available. As with all spice blends, recipes vary widely depending on the region and the cook, but this one, adapted from Lior Lev Sercarz of La Bo\u00eete in New York, includes ground sumac berries for acidity, toasted sesame seeds for their rich, earthy notes, and a little salt as well. Za\u2019atar can be used in marinades for grilled or roasted poultry or meats, mixed into dips, salads and egg dishes, or set on the table to be sprinkled on dishes as a bright and herby condiment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/24/dining/22Spicesrex1-zaatar/merlin_183522036_92858b7b-9f8e-44ab-b159-dd7c6cb1dd01-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1/3 cup", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "easy, condiments", "keywords": "sesame seeds, sumac, za\u2019atar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 126}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon/9 grams sesame seeds, preferably unhulled\u00a0", "3 tablespoons/5 grams dried za\u2019atar (see Note)\u00a0", "1 tablespoon/10 grams crushed or ground sumac", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a small skillet over medium heat.
