{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Bananas With Pecan-Coconut Crunch", "description": "This cozy dessert comes together quickly and fills the kitchen with a sweet, buttery aroma. The textures play well together: The spiced caramel is silky but robust, the bananas tender, and the pecan-and-coconut topping crunchy and crisp. Pick ripe but firm bananas so they\u2019ll maintain their shape after cooking. (The bananas should be yellow with no black spots; green bananas won\u2019t work.) Broil them until sizzling, then allow the bubbling caramel to cool and thicken a bit before serving. Devoured directly out of the skillet, or spooned into individual servings, these caramelized bananas are a lovely way to end a meal. Top with a scoop of ice cream for a cool contrast to the warm dessert.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/06/dining/yk-caramelized-bananas/yk-caramelized-bananas-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "banana, coconut, honey, pumpkin seeds, rolled oats, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 105}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "2 tablespoons honey", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/50 grams shelled pecans, chopped", "1/4 cup/35 grams raw pumpkin seeds", "1/4 cup/20 grams rolled oats", "1/4 cup/20 grams large coconut chips or flakes", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds, flax seeds, chia seeds or any other small seed", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/85 grams dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy cream", "Pinch of nutmeg", "Pinch of black pepper", "4 to 5 ripe but firm bananas (about 1 3/4 pounds/795 grams), peeled and halved lengthwise", "Ice cream, whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crunchy topping: In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium until melted and foamy, about 3 minutes.
