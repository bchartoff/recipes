{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rye Spaetzle Gratin", "description": "Unless you have an Eastern European heritage or a penchant for replicating the hearty cuisine of German beer halls, it may never have occurred to you to make spaetzle at home. I have both, and the small, squiggly egg dumplings are one of the first carb-heavy, comfort-food dishes I crave when the weather turns cold.\n\nMaking spaetzle is simpler than you may think. Mixing the ingredients is as easy as making pancake batter and uses pantry staples.\n\nThe only potentially tricky part is turning the batter into fluffy little dumplings. There are several approaches to this. Some people like to make a thick dough and grate it through the holes of a cheese grater. But if you keep the spaetzle mix as runny as cake batter, you\u2019ll be able to push it through a spaetzle maker (or colander) into a pot of boiling water fairly quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/ryespaetzle-still/ryespaetzle-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european, german", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "cabbage, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 74}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 407, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "599 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium savoy cabbage (1 1/2 pound)", "3/4 teaspoon whole caraway seeds", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 large leeks, thinly sliced (3 cups)", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "Large pinch chile flakes", "1 thyme branch", "2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar, or more to taste", "1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "180 grams all-purpose flour (1 1/2 cups)", "100 grams rye flour (3/4 cup)", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 to 1 1/2 cups whole milk, as needed", "8 ounces Gruy\u00e8re or Emmentaler cheese, grated (2 cups)", "Ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Discard the outer leaves of cabbage; quarter, core and slice the rest.
