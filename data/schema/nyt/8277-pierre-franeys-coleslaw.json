(It takes much less time to prepare than that.) The result pairs beautifully with any fried seafood and many grilled meats, particularly those scented with soy or curry. It will improve in flavor over the course of a few hours, so it is a good recipe to make in the heat of a weekend day, ahead of an evening barbecue.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "times classics", "keywords": "cabbage, carrot, vinegar, raw, vegetarian, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 85}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 341, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "750 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head cabbage, about 1 pound", "2 medium-size carrots, trimmed and scraped, about 1/3 pound", "2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon honey", "salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/2 cup vegetable oil", "2 teaspoons poppy seeds", "2 tablespoons finely chopped scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the cabbage into quarters.
