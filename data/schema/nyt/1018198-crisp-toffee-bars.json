{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crisp Toffee Bars", "description": "The original recipe for these buttery, basic toffee bars belongs to Maida Heatter, the great American dessert maven of the 20th century. It was adapted for a cast-iron skillet by Charlotte Druckman, who wrote a book on cast-iron baking in 2016. \u201cYou can caramelize a crust in cast iron in a way that would never happen in a sheet pan,\u201d she said. Make sure to bake the bars until very well browned across the top; that is the sign that the desired level of crisp chewiness has been achieved. The recipe calls for adding either nuts or chocolate to dough; you can add both if you like, but in that case use a larger cast-iron skillet (or use a plain old 9-by-13-inch baking pan).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/29/dining/29CASTIRON-WEB7/29CASTIRON-WEB7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dark brown sugar, slivered almonds, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 233}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 172, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "53 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 sticks/225 grams unsalted butter, cold but not frozen, more for buttering the pan", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup/210 grams soft-packed dark brown sugar", "2 cups/240 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "1 cup/100 grams slivered or sliced almonds (or walnut pieces), toasted, or\u00a06 ounces/170 grams chocolate chips or small chunks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
