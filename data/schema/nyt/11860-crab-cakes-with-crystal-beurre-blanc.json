{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crab Cakes With Crystal Beurre Blanc", "description": "This recipe came to The Times in 2006 from the Upperline restaurant in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. One bright light after the storms was an unexpected windfall in crab. The storms stirred up the marshes and shook up lots of food, so these crab cakes are made with an ice cream scoop and not a spoon. The real gem of the dish is the Crystal beurre blanc, an idea that mixes high French culinary canon with down-and-dirty New Orleans heat. Crystal Hot Sauce has long adorned many a table in New Orleans. It is more vinegary than Tabasco, which is too hot for this recipe. Baumer Foods had been making Crystal Hot Sauce for more than eight decades when the storms hit. Its New Orleans plant was flooded so badly that it was not reopened, but other bottlers kept Crystal on the shelves until the company could move into its new home, about a half hour\u2019s drive from its damaged factory.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/30/crosswords/Crab-Cakes-With-Crystal-Beurre-Blanc/Crab-Cakes-With-Crystal-Beurre-Blanc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "brunch, project", "keywords": "crab, seafood, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 42}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound jumbo lump crab meat", "1/2 cup chopped scallion", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 cup mashed potatoes", "6 tablespoons Crystal or other Louisiana-style hot sauce (do not use Tabasco)", "1 large lemon, peeled, pith removed, and halved", "2 tablespoons white wine", "1/4 cup heavy cream", "3/4 pound butter, chilled and cut into small pieces", "Salt", "1 tablespoon butter", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 large onion, peeled and chopped", "16-ounce bag baby spinach", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 cups all-purpose flour", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 large eggs", "2/3 cup milk", "2 cups fine dry bread crumbs", "Vegetable oil, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the crab cakes: In a large bowl, combine all ingredients for crab cakes.
