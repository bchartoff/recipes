First, reduce some apple cider until it's thick and glossy. While that simmers, toss together a quick compote of water, brown sugar, cinnamon and dried fruit. Make a simple pot of steel-cut oatmeal, spread it in a baking dish and chill for about an hour. (If you're a planner, you could do everything up to here the night before.)  Finally, cut into triangles and sear in a blazing-hot pan glistening with butter. Serve with compote and syrup and prepare for oohs, ahhs and oh-mys.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/09/health/09well_oatmeal/09well_oatmeal-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apple cider, dried fruit, steel-cut oats, dessert, fall, gluten-free, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 82}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups apple cider", "2 cups water", "1/4 cup  packed brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 (7-ounce) package dried mixed fruit bits", "1 cup fat-free milk", "3 cups water", "1/4 cup packed brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cups steel-cut (Irish) oats", "Cooking spray", "1/4 cup butter, divided"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To prepare syrup, bring cider to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.
