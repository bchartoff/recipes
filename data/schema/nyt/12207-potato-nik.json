Thanksgiving was always (in my memory) gray and blustery, and my grandmother\u2019s kitchen, steamy. She produced, almost solo, the traditionally ridiculous abundance of food, including my favorite, the potato \u201cnik,\u201d a huge latke fried in chicken fat until really brown, and as crisp as perfectly done shoestring fries. I still make this, and so can you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/27/dining/27FLEX_SPAN/27FLEX_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "main course, side dish, onion, potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 349}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 180, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "440 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 2 pounds baking potatoes, like Idaho or russet, peeled", "1 medium onion, peeled", "2 eggs", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons plain bread crumbs or matzo meal", "Neutral oil, like corn or grape seed."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate potatoes and onion by hand or with grating disk of a food processor; drain in colander or strainer.
