{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Choco Pan de Coco", "description": "Bryan Ford grew up in New Orleans, eating delicious, dense little pan de coco buns from the Honduran bodegas around town. But as a professional baker, he revisited the bread, using a sourdough starter to add dimension and texture, and even adding cocoa and chocolate chips to sweeten it up. In his cookbook, \u201cNew World Sourdough\u201d (Quarry Books, 2020), he calls this version choco pan de coco. The key, according to Mr. Ford, is to bake with love and to celebrate the bread you make \u2014 not to compare your own bread to the one in the picture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/09/magazine/09mag-eat/09mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "1 (8- or 9-inch) loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads, project", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, bread flour, coconut milk, coconut oil, shredded coconut, sourdough starter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 711}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces/60 grams mature sourdough starter", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/120 grams bread flour", "1/2 cup/110 milliliters warm water", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/200 milliliters canned coconut milk", "7 ounces/200 grams levain (about 1 generous cup)", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour", "1 2/3 cups/225 grams bread flour", "1 2/3 cups/125 grams unsweetened shredded coconut", "Scant 1/3 cup/50 grams bittersweet chocolate chips", "1/4 cup/25 grams Dutch process cocoa powder", "2 tablespoons/30 grams softened unsalted butter or coconut oil, plus 1 tablespoon for greasing the pan", "2 tablespoons/30 grams light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons/10 grams kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build the levain: In a large bowl, mix the mature sourdough starter, flour and warm water until incorporated.
