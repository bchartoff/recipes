Then of course there are the peanuts. When it comes to the peanut butter, \u201cnatural\u201d peanut butter, made from peanuts and salt and nothing else, works best. Chunky or creamy? It doesn\u2019t matter much. Finally, it\u2019s nice to time the cooking so that the sweet potatoes do not quite fall apart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/01/dining/peanutsoup/peanutsoup-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, soups and stews", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 335}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 689, "unsaturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1870 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup roasted and shelled peanuts", "2 tablespoons peanut or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn", "1 medium red or white onion, chopped", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken (about 2 thighs or breasts) cut into chunks", "Pinch of cayenne", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "6 cups stock or water", "2 sweet potatoes or yams (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into thick slices", "8 plum tomatoes, cored and halved (canned are fine; drain and reserve liquid for another use)", "1/2 pound collards or kale, washed and cut into wide ribbons", "1/4 to 1/2 cup peanut butter, chunky or smooth"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chop peanuts, or crush them with the side of a knife, or pulse them in a food processor to chop roughly."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put oil in a deep skillet or medium saucepan over medium heat; a minute later, add onion, ginger and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes.
