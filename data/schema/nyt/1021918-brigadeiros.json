The chef Natalia Pereira of Woodspoon in Los Angeles also makes more grownup, bittersweet brigadeiros by rolling them in cocoa powder or shredded coconut. Try her recipe, which she learned from her mother in Minas Gerais, Brazil, using either canned condensed milk or a homemade version. Either way, the candies will be tender and delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/21/magazine/21mag-eat/21mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 24 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "brazilian", "recipeCategory": "snack, candies, dessert", "keywords": "cocoa powder, sweetened condensed milk", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 409}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 cups whole milk", "1 cup granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing your hands", "1 3/4 cups homemade sweetened condensed milk or 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk", "5 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder, sifted", "Pinch of flaky sea salt", "1 cup chocolate or rainbow sprinkles"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using store-bought condensed milk, skip to Step 2.
