{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crisp Zucchini Blossoms Stuffed With Goat Cheese", "description": "Zucchini blossoms are a thing of wonder. They are great raw, in a salad, with a drizzle of good olive oil, but when they are coated in a crisp batter and stuffed with a light filling, they are an otherworldly experience. To get a good batter that isn\u2019t too thick or oily, ensure that your sparkling or soda water is very well carbonated and ice cold. Also take your time with the oil, testing it a few times to get the perfect temperature. Adjust the temperature as you go, making sure the flowers don\u2019t color too quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/dining/18ottolenghirex2/merlin_141025776_9c91064a-19e9-4e0c-8869-574358d596ee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, ricotta, soda water, sunflower oil, zucchini flowers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 282, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "289 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon ground sumac", "Boiling water", "1/4 cup/50 grams ricotta", "3 tablespoons/50 grams soft goat cheese", "1 teaspoon finely chopped oregano leaves", "2 tablespoons/10 grams chopped walnuts", "1 lemon, finely grated to get 1 tablespoon zest, then cut into wedges", "Flaky sea salt and black pepper", "8 zucchini blossoms", "About 1 1/2 cups/350 milliliters sunflower oil, for frying", "Scant 1/2 cup/60 grams all-purpose flour (plain flour)", "1/8 teaspoon baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/100 milliliters ice-cold sparkling or soda water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, cover 3/4 tablespoon of the sumac with 1 tablespoon of boiling water and leave to infuse for 5 minutes.
