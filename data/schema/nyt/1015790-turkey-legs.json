Most importantly, it requires no technique. It\u2019s easily batched and has no time-sensitive ingredients like sparkling wine or soda, so one could make the whole thing ahead of time, measure 3.25 ounces into glasses and be ready to swizzle when guests arrive.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/06/dining/video-holiday-drinks-turkey/video-holiday-drinks-turkey-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, cocktails", "keywords": "brandy, rum, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 9}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 417, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "86 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "20 milligrams", "sugarContent": "70 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup honey", "1 ounce brandy, preferably V.S.O.P.", "1/2 ounce blackstrap rum, such as Cruzan or Gosling\u2019s", "1/2 ounce fresh lime juice", "3/4 ounce St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram", "Sprig of fresh mint, for garnish", "Dash of Peychaud\u2019s Bitters"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make honey syrup: In a small saucepan, mix the honey with 1/4 cup hot water from the tap.
