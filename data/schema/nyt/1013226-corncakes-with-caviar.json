The cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and caviar are charming if you have them, but don\u2019t let a lack of caviar prevent you from making the cakes. You\u2019ll be just as happy eating them plain or with dollops of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and chives. The cakes\u2019 success hinges on their crispness. Keep your pan hot and steady; don\u2019t let the cakes steam or they\u2019ll turn floppy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/07/dining/Corncakes-With-Caviar/Corncakes-With-Caviar-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings (as a first course)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 419, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "450 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3-4 ears of fresh corn or 2 cups frozen whole kernel corn, defrosted", "1/3 cup whole milk", "1/3 cup flour", "1/4 cup melted unsalted butter", "1/3 cup cornmeal", "2 large eggs", "1 yolk from a large egg", "3 tablespoons finely chopped chives", "Salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup melted unsalted butter, preferably clarified", "1 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "6 tablespoons golden whitefish caviar, preferably fresh", "6 teaspoons black caviar, preferably fresh"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the corn kernels from the cobs, enough to produce 2 cups.
