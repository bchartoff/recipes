The flavors of pernil become accessible on a weeknight with the use of quicker-cooking chicken thighs. The chicken pieces are coated in a garlicky, oregano-and-citrus rub that combines orange and lime juice for a sweet-sour hit. Serve the juicy chicken with rice or tucked into corn tortillas; a simple green salad or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014788-simple-slaw\">cabbage slaw</a> would also make a nice accompaniment to complete the meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/10/dining/kc-pernil-style-roasted-chicken-thighs/merlin_215733990_7c33710f-a2ce-4953-ae39-5ead7b13195e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, garlic, lime juice, orange juice, oregano, roast chicken, sheet-pan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 503}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup neutral oil (such as safflower or canola)", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice\u00a0", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon granulated onion or onion powder", "Salt and pepper", "8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)", "1 medium yellow onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish", "Cooked rice or corn tortillas and hot sauce (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
