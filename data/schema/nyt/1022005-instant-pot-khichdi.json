This version is made with long-grain rice and yellow moong dal (or split mung beans), softened tomatoes and onion, then flavored with a cumin, coriander and turmeric, but each family has their own recipe. To bulk it up, you could add some grated carrot or zucchini with the onion, or wilt baby spinach in at the end.
