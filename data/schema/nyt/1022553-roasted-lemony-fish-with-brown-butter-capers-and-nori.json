{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Lemony Fish With Brown Butter, Capers and Nori", "description": "Drizzling a mild, white fish with a caper-spiked browned butter is classic for a reason. The butter adds richness to the lean fish, and the tanginess of capers and lemon perks up any mellowness. In this version, adapted from the chef Danielle Alvarez\u2019s cookbook \u201cAlways Add Lemon\u201d (Hardie Grant, 2020), nori oil adds another layer of umami flavor.\u00a0It\u2019s both bright and deep, with a silky texture that\u2019s easy to achieve. Serve it with rice or bread to mop up all the saline, buttery juices.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/15/dining/10apperex/merlin_194303421_bc0df0ba-1961-41dd-aa58-fc28e395707e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "brown butter, capers, lemon, nori, parsley, white fish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 845}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 pounds/6 (6-ounce) fillets white fish, such as hake or cod", "Salt\u00a0and freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 lemons", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup parsley leaves and tender stems, coarsely chopped", "2 tablespoons capers, drained", "10 nori seaweed snack sheets, crumbled (about 1/3 cup)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt\u00a0and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 475 degrees.
