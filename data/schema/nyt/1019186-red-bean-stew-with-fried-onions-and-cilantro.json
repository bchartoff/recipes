{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red Bean Stew With Fried Onions and Cilantro", "description": "Based on lobio, a Georgian stew, this is a warming, thick mix of simmered beans seasoned with both raw and fried onions, garlic and plenty of cilantro. In Georgia, the stew is sometimes spiked with a sour plum sauce called tkemali, which you can find at specialty markets or online. But if you can\u2019t get it, pomegranate molasses (or even a good balsamic vinegar) will give the dish a similarly fruity tang. Note that the bean mixture will thicken as it cools, so be prepared to add a bit of water or broth upon reheating.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/21/dining/21appetite1/merlin_133673211_d48cb556-18fa-4a34-9c66-93a08ba7bffc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "kidney bean, summer savory, tkemali, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 343}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 227, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "185 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried red kidney beans, rinsed", "3 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt, more as needed", "3 bay leaves", "4 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 1/2 cups packed cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more leaves for garnish", "1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh summer savory or oregano leaves", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon dried blue fenugreek (optional)", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste", "1 large Spanish or yellow onion, diced", "1 1/2 tablespoons olive or safflower oil", "Tkemali (Georgian plum sauce), pomegranate molasses or balsamic vinegar, to taste", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, more to taste", "Pomegranate seeds, for garnish (optional)", "Suluguni, feta or ricotta salata cheese, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine beans and 1 teaspoon salt.
