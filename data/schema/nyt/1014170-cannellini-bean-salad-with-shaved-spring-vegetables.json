Obviously, they take a little advance planning. You can\u2019t hurry a pot of beans, but you can cook them the day or even the morning before you need them. This a good habit to get into, as a small batch of freshly cooked beans is well worth the little effort it takes to get them cooked. (And by all means, use a real stovetop if you have one.) Don\u2019t cave and go the canned-bean route \u2014 save those for emergencies or camping trips.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/Cannellini-Bean-Salad/Cannellini-Bean-Salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, cannellini beans, vegetables", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 133}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 268, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "331 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons lemon juice, or as needed", "Finely grated zest of half a lemon", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon ground fennel seed", "4 to 6 anchovy fillets, rinsed and chopped", "Salt", "pepper", "1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 cups cooked cannellini beans, drained", "Salt", "pepper", "Pinch red pepper flakes", "6 to 8 large, fat asparagus spears, snapped and peeled", "6 radishes", "1 small fennel bulb, trimmed", "1 small sweet spring onion, or a few scallions, finely chopped", "Chopped parsley, basil or dill, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the vinaigrette, whisk together the vinaigrette ingredients.
