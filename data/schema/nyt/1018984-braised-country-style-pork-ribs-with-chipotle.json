To avoid burning the spices, the ribs are coated with spice rub only on the side that doesn't get browned. Though the pomegranate seeds are not essential, they do add a nice hit of tartness and texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Willoughby"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/dining/03CountryRibs3/03CountryRibs3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "beer, chipotle, pork rib, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 228}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 781, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "68 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1155 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds bone-in or 2 1/2 pounds boneless country-style pork ribs", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "2 teaspoons dried ground chipotle pepper", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 red onions, halved and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "3/4 cup orange juice", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice", "1/4 cup to 1 cup beer of your choice", "1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro, for garnish", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds, for garnish\u00a0 (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dry the ribs well, sprinkle all over with salt and allow to sit, refrigerated, for 1 to 2 1/2 hours."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine cumin, coriander, chipotle pepper, black pepper, cayenne and cinnamon, and mix well.
