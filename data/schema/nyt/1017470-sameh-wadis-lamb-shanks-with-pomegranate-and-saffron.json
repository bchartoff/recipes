{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sameh Wadi\u2019s Lamb Shanks With Pomegranate and Saffron", "description": "This glossy, savory stew combines two staples of traditional Middle Eastern cooking: rich lamb and tangy, sweet-sour pomegranate. It makes a vivid main course, with each meaty shank garnished with bright pomegranate seeds \u2014 perfect for a festive dinner such as Eid al-Fitr, the feast day on the Muslim calendar that marks the end of daily fasting for Ramadan.\n\nPomegranate molasses is easy to find in Middle Eastern markets. Date syrup or sherry or balsamic vinegar could also work, since the pomegranate juice in the recipe already provides the tannic flavors you are looking for in the sauce \u2014 but adjust the amount carefully to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/17/dining/17RAMADAN_SAFFRON2/17RAMADAN_SAFFRON2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts, main course", "keywords": "grapeseed oil, lamb shanks, pomegranate juice, pomegranate molasses, yellow onion, ramadan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 222}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 lamb shanks, about 1 pound each", "Sea salt", "Grapeseed or canola oil", "6 cups coarsely chopped yellow onions", "Scant 1/2 cup sliced garlic cloves", "1/4 cup grated fresh ginger", "1 1/2 tablespoons ras el hanout (see note)", "2 teaspoons saffron threads", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "6 cups chicken stock or water", "4 cups pomegranate juice", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "2 teaspoons pomegranate molasses or grenadine", "Seeds of 1 medium pomegranate", "1/4 cup cilantro, roughly chopped", "1/4 cup pistachios, chopped", "Flaky salt, like Maldon or fleur de sel, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
