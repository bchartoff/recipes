{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Wild Mushrooms", "description": "When I was in Paris recently, wild mushrooms \u2013 c\u00e8pes (porchinis) in particular \u2013 seemed to be on every restaurant menu. It was the season. Inspired, I went to the market and bought a small amount of wild mushrooms \u2013 some girolles, oyster mushrooms and others (but not c\u00e8pes, which were out of my price range). In fact they were all pretty much out of my price range, as they often are here. But I didn\u2019t need too many to make enough pan-seared mushrooms for a few unforgettable bruschetta. You can also serve them over a bowl of quinoa or other grains, with strips of egg pancake scattered over the top. The pan-seared mushrooms take only about 10 minutes to cook; make sure the pan is nice and hot when you add them so that they sear right away. Once they have begun to sweat you can turn down the heat a bit and add the other ingredients.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/02/science/01recipehealthmushroom/01recipehealthmushroom-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT12M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack", "keywords": "fall, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 36}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 395, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "589 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 pound wild mushrooms, torn into smaller pieces if large, cleaned if necessary", "1/2 cup chopped onion or 2 shallots, minced", "2 garlic cloves, minced, plus 1/2 garlic clove, intact", "1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves, chopped", "1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary or sage", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "8 thick slices country bread or 2 to 3 cups cooked quinoa", "2 ounces Parmesan, crumbled or grated", "2 eggs", "Chopped flat-leaf parsley for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide, heavy nonstick skillet or a wok over high heat.
