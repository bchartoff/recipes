{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Swordfish BLT", "description": "Here\u2019s a summery take on grilled swordfish, dressed with the fixings for that ever-popular, all-American sandwich, the BLT. No, it's not a slice of grilled swordfish in a sandwich, though that might not be a bad idea in some other context. This dish is dinner-party fare, fresh off the grill. Bacon, arugula and tomatoes in a lemony dressing, bolstered with bacon fat, top and sauce the fish. As an added bonus, I\u2019ve brushed some of the bacon fat on the fish before grilling. The BLT mixture can be assembled a couple of hours in advance, so the grilling is the only last-minute task. The finished dish has a bright, beautiful presentation that suits the season.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/11pairrex/merlin_140379429_2c1dcbea-1967-4a05-920c-66563047d2ff-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood", "keywords": "arugula, bacon, swordfish, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 55}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 519, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "642 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound thick-sliced bacon, about 9 strips", "1 cup halved grape tomatoes, about 30", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and ground black pepper", "2 1/2 pounds swordfish steaks, in 6 portions", "1 cup packed, finely chopped arugula"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fry bacon to medium doneness, remove to drain on paper towels and reserve fat.
