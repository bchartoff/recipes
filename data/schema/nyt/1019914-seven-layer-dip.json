{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seven-Layer Dip", "description": "For this recipe, the traditional 7-layer dip has been revisited so that each layer is good enough to eat on its own, but isn\u2019t so much effort that the whole thing can\u2019t be finished in 20 minutes. The order of the layers offers some delightful moments, like where the cheese melts into the warm refried beans or where the cool sour cream meets the fiery salsa. Cilantro and scallions serve as a refreshing counterpoint, and Fritos lend added crunch. No need to dig out your trifle bowl: A platter with a lip is preferred here for easier scooping.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/14/dining/as-seven-layer-dip/as-seven-layer-dip-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, avocado, cheddar, olives, refried beans, salsa, sour cream, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 425}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 283, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "622 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup sour cream", "1 jalape\u00f1o, finely chopped (about 2 tablespoons)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 medium ripe avocados", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice (from 1 lime)", "1 (16-ounce) can refried beans", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 cup freshly grated Cheddar (about 4 ounces)", "1 cup sliced black olives (about 4 ounces)", "3/4 cup good-quality, store-bought red salsa, fresh or jarred and any heat level (drained if watery)", "1/2 cup Fritos or corn nuts, crumbled", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions (about 2 scallions)", "1/4 cup tightly packed cilantro leaves", "Tortilla chips, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and half the jalape\u00f1o (about 1 tablespoon).
