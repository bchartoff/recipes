{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cuban-Style Arroz Congr\u00ed", "description": "The combination of white rice and black beans is a Cuban staple. Black beans served on top of or next to white rice is most commonly called Moros y Cristianos, a reference to the medieval battle between Islamic Moors and Christian Spaniards on the Iberian Peninsula. When rice and beans are mixed with saut\u00e9ed aromatic vegetables and sometimes bits of pork, the result is called congr\u00ed. (In some Cuban households, it is also called Moros y Cristianos.) As a rule, congr\u00ed is a fluffier and drier dish than Moros y Cristianos. Yolanda Horruitiner, who has lived in Cuba for all of her 70 years, makes this simple version of congr\u00ed without pork or cumin, which is a staple in some versions. Feel free to add either to the sofrito base. This recipe uses a stovetop to cook both the rice and beans, although the dish can be assembled more quickly using a pressure cooker and rice cooker and making the sofrito in a separate saut\u00e9 pan, then mixing it into the rice before it\u2019s all cooked.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/18/dining/18JPCUBA3/18JPCUBA3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "\u00a06 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "black beans, long-grain rice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 296}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 253, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "203 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried black beans\u00a0", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 small onion, chopped\u00a0into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 small green pepper, chopped\u00a0into 1/2-inch pieces", "5 or 6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "Freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon fresh oregano, roughly chopped", "1/4 teaspoon dried dill", "2 small bay leaves", "1 tablespoon cider vinegar", "1 tablespoon dry red wine, or vino seco", "1 1/2 cups long-grain rice, rinsed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the beans and pick them over for any small stones.
