{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Foolproof Lemon-Garlic Mayonnaise", "description": "Mayonnaise started out in life as a salad dressing, but the modern supermarket version isn\u2019t something you\u2019d want to serve on its own -- or use to highlight the vegetables of the season. This soft, lemony version makes irresistible dribbles and pools on top of a composed salad, or can be spooned onto the side of the plate and used for dipping. The hot water keeps the mayonnaise smooth and fluffy. For an even lighter texture, use grapeseed oil instead of olive oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20SALAD3/20SALAD3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 heaping cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "anchovies, dijon mustard, egg yolks, garlic, lemon juice, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 89}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1021, "unsaturatedFatContent": "93 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "113 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "343 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 clove garlic, minced", "4 oil-packed anchovies, minced (optional)", "1 large egg yolk, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In small food processor or container of an immersion blender, combine garlic, anchovies, egg yolk and mustard.
