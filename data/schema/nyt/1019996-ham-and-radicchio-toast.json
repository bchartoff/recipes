It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nTake a quick trip to the supermarket on the way home: bread and a small head of radicchio, as well as a half-pound of thin-sliced ham at the deli counter and some good mustard. When you\u2019re ready to eat, cut the ham and radicchio into ribbons, then saut\u00e9 the radicchio in a medium-hot saut\u00e9 pan with a few glugs of olive oil and some chopped garlic until softened. Take the pan off the stove, add the ham and toss to combine. Meanwhile, slice the bread \u2014 you want two slices per person \u2014 and toast it if you like. Either way, slash some mustard onto the slices. Pile the warm radicchio and ham on top and consume with good wine.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17NORECIPE-HAM-RADICCHIO-TOAST/17NORECIPE-HAM-RADICCHIO-TOAST-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, sandwiches", "keywords": "ham, radicchio, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 37}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
