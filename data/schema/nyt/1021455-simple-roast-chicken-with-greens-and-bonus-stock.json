Reserve the bones, and let them simmer in salted water with a few simple aromatics, while you answer emails, check the news or drink some wine. The chicken here is first roasted in a skillet, so even the drippings don't go to waste, used to saut\u00e9 some hearty greens as a side. But you can use any pan you like, as long as it has a rim to catch the juices.
