{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy Greens With Carrot-Ginger Dressing", "description": "This recipe draws inspiration from the sunny-orange flavor of green salads with carrot-ginger dressing at Japanese American restaurants. The pulpy, aromatic dressing may be the star, but a salad is only as good as its lettuce. After washing and thoroughly spin-drying the greens in a salad spinner (alternatively, you can pat them dry in a clean kitchen towel), one way to maximize their crunch before adding the dressing is to refrigerate them, covered, for at least 30 minutes. Little Gem has a sweet, juicy sturdiness, but regular packaged mixed greens, baby spinach and chopped romaine hearts work, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/EK-Crunchy-Greens-with-Carrot-Ginger-Dressing-15SALADREX/merlin_209652402_268d3c33-6a01-44a4-9ec9-be67e413aeaf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "carrot, ginger, green salad, lettuce, rice vinegar, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 639}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "Salt", "2 to 4 heads Little Gem lettuce, leaves separated, or 1 romaine heart, chopped", "1 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: In a food processor, pur\u00e9e the carrot, ginger, olive oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, onion powder, a pinch of salt and 1 tablespoon cold water until as smooth as possible, 1 to 2 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Dress the salad: Place the lettuce leaves in a large serving bowl.
