{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Simplest Corn Pudding", "description": "This recipe is deliberately, exquisitely simple, with pure sweet corn flavor. Grate corn kernels directly into a cast-iron pan and place in the oven, without any seasonings. The corn releases its milk, which thickens, and the kernels turn golden and lightly caramelized around the edges. Only then do you season it, and only lightly: A bit of butter, a sprinkle of salt and cayenne, and the juice of half a lime. Mix. Serve. Adding the seasoning at the end allows you to better control the taste of the finished dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Elaine Louie"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/23/dining/cornpudding/cornpudding-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "corn, side dish, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 114}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ears of corn, husked", "1 tablespoon butter", "Salt", "Cayenne pepper", "Half a lime"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
