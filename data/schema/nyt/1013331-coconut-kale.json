{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Kale", "description": "The kale in this recipe, adapted from Vij\u2019s Restaurant, in Vancouver, British Columbia, is rich and fiery, sweet and salty all at once. Grilling softens the texture of the kale without entirely removing the mild bitterness of the leaves, while the marinade of coconut milk, cayenne, salt and lemon juice caramelizes in the heat to create a perfect balance of flavors. Made over a charcoal fire or even in a broiler or wickedly hot pan, it becomes a dish of uncommon flavor, the sort of thing you could eat on its own, with only a mound of basmati rice for contrast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/29/dining/Grilled-Coconut-Kale/Grilled-Coconut-Kale-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "coconut milk, kale, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 329}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 130, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "350 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 bunches kale", "3-13 1/2-ounce cans coconut milk", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1 teaspoon mild paprika", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the kale thoroughly and cut out the stalks.
