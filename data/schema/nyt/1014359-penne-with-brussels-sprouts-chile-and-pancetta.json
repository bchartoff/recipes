{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Penne With Brussels Sprouts, Chile and Pancetta", "description": "Pasta and sliced brussels sprouts make a good pair, the softened green shreds commingling with the chewy noodles in the sauce. Here that sauce is a simple one with big flavors: pancetta, rosemary, garlic and chile. The raw brussels are then added to the pan. A splash of lemon juice at the end is a bright touch. Within 30 minutes, dinner is ready. Vary this recipe at will \u2014 use regular bacon instead of pancetta, or skip the meat altogether and use extra cheese to make a satisfying vegetarian main course. Use a knife or a food processor (fitted with the slicing blade) to cut the brussels. A mandoline works too but isn\u2019t necessary, because the brussels don\u2019t need to be paper thin, or uniform in size. These are unfussy slices you can do by hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/28/dining/28APPETITE_SPAN/28APPETITE_SPAN-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, pastas", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, pancetta, penne, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 676}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 701, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "100 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "668 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Sea salt", "8 ounces penne", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "3 ounces pancetta, diced", "1 large rosemary sprig", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 jalape\u00f1o or Serrano chile, thinly sliced (or substitute 1 large pinch crushed red pepper flakes)", "Freshly ground black pepper", "8 ounces brussels sprouts, thinly sliced", "2 teaspoons butter", "Fresh lemon juice, for serving", "Freshly grated pecorino cheese (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring large pot heavily salted water to a boil.
