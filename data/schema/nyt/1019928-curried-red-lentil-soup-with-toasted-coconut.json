{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Curried Red Lentil Soup With Toasted Coconut", "description": "Fresh ginger along with plenty of earthy spices like turmeric and coriander add complexity to this otherwise unassuming lentil soup. The dish is perfect for a weeknight as the legumes here cook fairly quickly. Pairing the lentils with bold, warming spices gives them a big boost of flavor in a short amount of time. To make the soup feel extra special, toast coconut flakes for a crunchy topping, and put out bowls of roughly chopped cilantro, thinly sliced scallions and lime wedges, so guests can top their soup as they please. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious, a topping of fried shallots seasoned with flaky salt would also be nice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/11/dining/ch-red-lentil-soup/merlin_150298527_c3920b3e-64e8-4978-84ec-5f772021e26e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "coriander, curry powder, ginger, red lentils, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 237}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 299, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "915 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 medium red onion, finely chopped", "1 medium carrot, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "1 tablespoon curry powder", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 cup red lentils", "5 cups vegetable stock or water", "1/4 cup unsweetened coconut flakes", "Cilantro, scallions and lime wedges, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
