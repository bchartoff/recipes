{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Harissa-Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Red Onion", "description": "This simple salad is powered by two naturally sweet vegetables \u2013\u00a0 sweet potato and red onion \u2013 but harissa, the popular north African spice paste, balances everything out. Harissa adds more than just a subtle heat to a dish; it injects smokiness, tang, richness and overall intrigue. When shopping, look for harissa that has a deep, brick-red color, a thick consistency and dried red chiles listed as one of the first ingredients. Cutting the sweet potatoes into wedges creates sharp edges so that they get crispy and golden in the oven. This dish is easily adaptable, and simple to make into a complete meal by adding roasted chickpeas, cooked lentils or grilled radicchio.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/14/dining/hm-harissa-sweet-potato/hm-harissa-sweet-potato-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "fall, winter, harissa, red onion, salad, sheet-pan, sweet potato, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 515}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 medium sweet potatoes, washed and trimmed, (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "3 medium red onions, peeled and trimmed (about 1 pound)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons harissa paste, plus more for serving", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 lemon", "3 ounces feta, crumbled (optional)", "Handful of cilantro or mint leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
