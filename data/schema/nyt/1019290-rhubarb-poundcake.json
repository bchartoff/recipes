{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb Poundcake", "description": "This tender poundcake has slivers of vanilla-poached rhubarb running across the top and shot through the center, adding a tangy sweetness to the buttery crumb. For the most vivid stripes, use the reddest rhubarb stalks you can find. They will fade to hot pink after poaching and baking. Green rhubarb also works; the cake won\u2019t be quite as striking, but it will be equally delectable. This cake is best served within a day of baking. After that, the rhubarb will start to dry out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/16/dining/16Appe1/merlin_137783244_46c80784-6bfd-4513-80b1-16fd5912a88e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, cakes", "keywords": "dessert, rhubarb, vanilla bean, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 500}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 359, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "157 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces rhubarb stalks (about 3 to 4 large stalks)", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped with the tip of a knife and reserved", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 2/3 cups/200 grams cake flour, plus more for flouring the pan", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/3 cup whole milk", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped with the tip of a knife and reserved", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut rhubarb stalks to fit crosswise inside the top of a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.
