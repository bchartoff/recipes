{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Australian Zucchini Slice", "description": "A beloved Australian staple, a zucchini slice is an eggy, frittatalike lunchbox staple that\u2019s baked until it\u2019s firm enough to slice and eat out of hand. Most versions include bacon, but in his book, \u201cSnacks for Dinner\u201d (Harper Wave, 2022), Lukas Volger substitutes a combination of olives and pickled peppers for a deeply salty bite without any meat. You can serve this hot, warm or at room temperature. Or make it a day or two ahead, store it covered in the fridge, then let it come to room temperature before serving so the texture is supple and soft.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/20/dining/15Apperex/merlin_209983596_a399d712-cec8-4303-8fa2-a9c4ac787f3a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "australian", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, casseroles, main course", "keywords": "leek, pickled jalape\u00f1os, zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 490}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for the pan", "1 large leek, white and light green parts, halved and thinly sliced into half moons (1 1/2 cups)", "4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1/3 cup coarsely chopped green olives", "1/3 cup coarsely chopped pickled peppers (such as jalape\u00f1os and pepperoncini)", "1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), more as needed", "5 large eggs", "2 small zucchini, about 14 ounces, grated (2 1/2 cups)", "1 cup shredded Cheddar", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro, basil or dill (or a combination)", "1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "Flaky sea salt and chile flakes, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees and brush an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with olive oil.
