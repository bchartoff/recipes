{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Macaroni and Beef Casserole", "description": "This homey casserole was developed by Pierre Franey in 1991 for the 60-Minute Gourmet column. It is hearty sustenance that evokes memories of childhood and sweater weather. Its preparation is simple, but its flavors veer elegant. Saut\u00e9 onions, celery, green peppers and garlic. Add the meat, then oregano, basil and tomatoes. Whisk together a quick Cheddar cheese bechamel that's seasoned with cayenne and nutmeg then pour it on top. At the last minute, sprinkle a little Parmesan on top and slide it under a broiler to brown. Serve with crisp green salad and a hunk of French bread. Comfort food at its finest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/14/dining/14MACnBEEF2/14MACnBEEF2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "beef, cheese, macaroni, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2568}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 763, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "52 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "2138 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 quarts water", "Salt to taste", "1 1/2 cups elbow macaroni", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 cup chopped onions", "1/4 cup chopped celery", "1/4 cup chopped green pepper", "2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic", "1 pound lean ground beef chuck or round steak", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano (or 1 teaspoon dried)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or Italian parsley", "1/2 cup canned crushed tomatoes", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 tablespoons flour", "2 cups milk", "2 cups cubed or shredded Cheddar cheese", "Cayenne pepper to taste", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring the water with salt to a boil.
