Smoked fish is key here; salmon adds beautiful richness and color, and any white fillet completes the picture. Serve this dish with buttered rye croutons instead of the traditional boiled potatoes for more flavor and crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/09/magazine/09eat2/09eat2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "halibut, salmon, sauerkraut, smoked ham, smoked trout, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 29}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 809, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "1784 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter", "2 cups rye-bread cubes", "1 pound sauerkraut, rinsed and drained", "4 ounces chopped smoked ham or slab bacon", "1 teaspoon juniper berries, crushed", "1 teaspoon caraway seeds", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme, or 1/2 teaspoon dried", "3 bay leaves", "1 cup white wine, not necessarily bone-dry", "1/2 to 3/4 pound white-fleshed fillet, like halibut", "1/2 to 3/4 pound smoked trout or haddock", "1/2 to 3/4 pound skinned salmon", "Salt\tand\tpepper", "1 shallot, minced", "1/2 cup cream", "Juice of 1 lemon", "Chopped fresh parsley for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 300.
