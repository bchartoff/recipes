However you choose to make it, serve the dish over hot rice or simmered noodles and finish it with a little drizzle of Sichuan chile oil, if you\u2019ve got it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/24/magazine/24mag-eat/24mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "beef, beef stew meat, ginger, sichuan peppercorns, star anise", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 513}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound boneless beef shank or stew cuts", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1/2 red onion, diced", "2 scallions, trimmed and sliced", "1 (1 1/2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced", "1 star anise pod, broken", "2 dried red chiles, such as Tianjin or chiles de \u00e1rbol, broken into a few pieces", "2 teaspoons Pixian doubanjiang or spicy broad-bean paste", "2 tablespoons Shaoxing cooking wine", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 small tomato, diced", "1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorn powder (or 2 tablespoons whole Sichuan peppercorns, finely ground)", "1 teaspoon red chile powder (preferably from Tianjin chiles)", "1 tablespoon Sichuan chile crisp"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the meat in a large pot and cover with cold water by about 2 inches; bring to a boil.
