{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon With Yogurt-Curry Sauce", "description": "With its rich flesh, salmon is so strongly flavored that you can pair it with just about anything. Here I cook it with a yogurt sauce that contains just chopped cucumber and spices. If you use farmed salmon and a nonstick skillet, you won't even need to add any fat. That's because farmed salmon is so high in fat (fattier than wild salmon, and it's the beneficial omega-3 type, too) that it's difficult to overcook. This is not to say you can put it on the stove and walk away, but that precision is a goal rather than a necessity. Even if you like your fish cooked through, the result will be a piece of meat that still has a fair amount of moisture in it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/19/dining/19COOKING-SALMONCURRY1/19COOKING-SALMONCURRY1-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood", "keywords": "fish, salmon, yogurt, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 349}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 445, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "746 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups plain yogurt", "1 small cucumber, peeled", "Salt and pepper", "10 cardamom pods, remove seeds and discard hulls", "1 3-inch cinnamon stick", "1 teaspoon cloves", "1/2 teaspoon nutmeg pieces (smack a whole nutmeg with a hammer)", "1 tablespoon cumin seeds", "1 tablespoon fennel seeds", "1 tablespoon black peppercorns", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, like corn or grapeseed, if necessary", "4 6-ounce salmon fillets", "Lime wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If yogurt is very thin, put it in a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a bowl.
