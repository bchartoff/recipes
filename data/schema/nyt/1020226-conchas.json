Their name, meaning \u201cshells,\u201d comes from the pretty, sugary scalloped topping that covers each bun. The chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara, of Contramar in Mexico City, says that cooks in Mexico rarely bake conchas at home, but she developed a recipe out of necessity when cooking at Cala, her restaurant in San Francisco. At lunchtime, she splits leftover conchas to make sandwiches, which she says are especially good with spicy fillings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/05/dining/04Camararex1-copy/04Camararex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "12 buns", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, lunch, snack, breads, pastries", "keywords": "active dry yeast, almond flour, cinnamon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 311}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast\u00a0(1 package)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters warm water", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters warm milk", "1 teaspoon plus 1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/110 grams unsalted butter, softened at room temperature, plus more for greasing", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 eggs, at room temperature", "4 cups/500 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon vegetable oil", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/30 grams almond flour", "1/4 cup/55 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine yeast, water and milk.
