The wonderful buttery flavor is obtained from the technique called tarka, which means spices sizzled in ghee, added to the pot at the end of the cooking process. Whirl the dal in a blender for a velvet-smooth texture. You could serve it as is, with the texture of a thick vegetable pur\u00e9e, or thin it with a little water and serve it as a soup. Other legumes such as red lentils or yellow split peas may be used instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/28/dining/recipes-butterymoongdal/recipes-butterymoongdal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "cumin, garlic, mung beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 148}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 55, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "121 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup moong dal (split mung beans), soaked 2 hours in cold water, drained and rinsed", "1/2 teaspoon turmeric", "1 teaspoon salt", "3 tablespoons ghee, clarified butter or vegetable oil", "1/2 teaspoon cumin", "1 green chile, slit lengthwise", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 large shallot, diced", "Garam masala or red chile powder (optional)", "Plain basmati rice, freshly cooked, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put dal, turmeric and salt in a large soup pot, add 7 cups water and bring to a gentle boil, stirring.
