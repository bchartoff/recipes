The steaks are then left to marinate for a few hours in the refrigerator before grilling. The cooked fish is topped with a quick relish made of fresh corn, ginger, onion, cilantro and a bit of the spice mixture that's been saut\u00e9ed in clarified butter. It's an unexpected yet extraordinary way to prepare fish that might just win over the self-proclaimed seafood-haters at the table.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/31/dining/halibut-corn-salsa/halibut-corn-salsa-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "corn, ghee, halibut, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 134}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground fennel seeds", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 halibut steaks, 1 inch thick, 2 to 2 1/2 pounds total (Pacific salmon, wild striped bass, hake steaks or fillets of these fish can be substituted)", "2 lemons", "4 tablespoons ghee (sold in Indian stores and fancy food shops) or clarified butter; vegetable oil can be substituted", "1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion", "1 cup cooked fresh corn kernels (about 1 ear of corn)", "Oil for grill", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine cumin, turmeric, coriander, fennel, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste.
