{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Bean Burger With an Egg on Top", "description": "This is a vegetarian burger that does not mimic the texture or look of ground meat, but it isn\u2019t meant to. It\u2019s more like the most excellent refried beans. Though you can serve this well-seasoned patty like a traditional burger, on a bun with the usual condiments, it is at its best topped with a fried egg. Dusted with fine cornmeal, the burgers are pan-fried as the mixture is too soft to grill. After frying, they are baked until crisp. For convenience, they may be fried in advance and reheated.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/15/dining/10tanis2/merlin_174283629_0d31e066-8eb1-4043-8a48-d6978882e0cd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "burgers, grains and rice, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "black beans, rice, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 824}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, or 4 cups cooked black beans, on the firm side", "1 cup cooked brown rice, cooled", "1 cup chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems, plus sprigs for garnish", "1 serrano chile, finely chopped", "1 cup chopped scallions, both white and green parts", "1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder or piment\u00f3n picante", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and ground, or 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "Pinch of ground cayenne", "Salt", "1 large egg, beaten", "2 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in 1 tablespoon cold water", "Neutral oil, such as grapeseed or safflower, for frying", "Fine cornmeal, for coating patties", "1 sunny-side up egg per person (optional, but recommended)", "Toasted buns, lettuce leaves and condiments (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put beans in a colander set over a bowl and drain well.
