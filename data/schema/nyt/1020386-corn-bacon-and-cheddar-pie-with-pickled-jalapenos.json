{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn, Bacon and Cheddar Pie With Pickled Jalape\u00f1os", "description": "Corn kernels make this quiche-like pie juicy-sweet. Bacon, jalape\u00f1o and quick-pickled onions make it deeply savory, and a custard of sour cream, eggs and Cheddar adds a delightfully gooey texture. A touch of cornmeal in the dough makes the crust extra crunchy, and its corn flavor echoes the filling. You can bake this in the height of corn season with fresh kernels, or in the depths of winter with frozen. It will be just as richly satisfying any time of the year.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/14/dining/09apperex-cornpie1/merlin_158856405_d4339f29-4a19-4e95-92f8-1de0d2e48777-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, pies and tarts", "keywords": "bacon, cheddar, corn, jalape\u00f1o, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 532}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1/4 cup/40 grams cornmeal", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick), cubed", "3 to 6 tablespoons ice water", "1 small red onion", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "Pinch of granulated sugar", "4 ounces bacon (4 slices), diced", "1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels (from 2 small ears if fresh)", "2 tablespoons chopped pickled jalape\u00f1o, plus more slices for topping", "1 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup sour cream or plain Greek yogurt", "3 large eggs", "3/4 cup coarsely shredded sharp Cheddar (3 ounces)", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the crust: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, or in a large bowl, pulse or mix together flour, cornmeal and salt until combined.
