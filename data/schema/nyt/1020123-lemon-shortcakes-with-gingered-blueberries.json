To make that an easy prospect, you can prepare and freeze them in advance: Prepare the dough through Step 3, freeze the shortcakes completely, then transfer them to an airtight container for up to one week.

They\u2019re wonderful served straight from the oven, but\u00a0if you plan to layer them with cream and fruit, let them cool to room temperature first.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/27/dining/ss-lemon-shortcakes/ss-lemon-shortcakes-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, pastries", "keywords": "blueberries, butter, confectioners' sugar, crystalized ginger, heavy cream, lemon, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 736, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "sodiumContent": "389 milligrams", "sugarContent": "21 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "Zest of 1 large lemon (about 4 teaspoons), plus 1/4 cup/60 milliliters juice", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "10 tablespoons/140 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters cold heavy cream, plus more for brushing", "1 large egg", "2 cups/290 grams fresh blueberries", "2 tablespoons/25 grams chopped crystallized ginger", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters heavy cream, chilled", "1 tablespoon confectioners\u2019 sugar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
