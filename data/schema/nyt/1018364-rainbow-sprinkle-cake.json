{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rainbow Sprinkle Cake", "description": "In the 1990s, when home bakers started putting rainbow sprinkles in their cakes, as well as on their cakes, the Funfetti craze was born.  Pillsbury introduced its Funfetti cake mix in 1989, and the idea was quickly adopted by home cooks for waffles, pancakes and cupcakes. Now, as seen on photo-friendly social media sites like Instagram and Pinterest, rainbow sprinkles are decorating everything from morning smoothie bowls to late-night martinis. But the Funfetti layer cake is still the most fun. You can buy premixed rainbow sprinkles, but professionals mix their own to get just the right color combination. (Coming up with a signature \"house blend\" is a good Saturday morning project for kids.) And though it may be tempting, do not use any sprinkles made with natural colorings in the cake -- they fade away, instead of leaving beautiful streaks of color.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/01/dining/jm-rainbow-sprinkle-cake/jm-rainbow-sprinkle-cake-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, rainbow sprinkles, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1503}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 628, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "93 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "264 milligrams", "sugarContent": "78 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/110 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), slightly softened, more for pans", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour, more for pans", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/4 teaspoon fine salt", "2/3 cup/158 milliliters whole milk", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1 cup/200 grams sugar", "1 whole egg plus 2 egg whites", "1/3 cup rainbow sprinkles (not pastel, or naturally colored)", "8 ounces/225 grams cream cheese, slightly softened", "1/2 cup/110 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), slightly softened", "1/8 teaspoon fine salt, more to taste", "3 cups/300 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1 cup rainbow sprinkles (see note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat oven to 325 degrees and place a rack in the center.
