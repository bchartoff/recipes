{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Shiro (Ground-Chickpea Stew)", "description": "Shiro is a simple, silky ground chickpea stew that takes little time and effort to bring together. In Eritrea and Ethiopia, it\u2019s a most beloved and important dish \u2014 a vital source of flavor and protein. In those countries, it\u2019s made with widely available shiro powder, a mixture of ground chickpeas, garlic, onion and spices. This version, based on Ghennet Tesfamicael\u2019s recipe published in \u201cIn Bibi\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d by Hawa Hassan with Julia Turshen, cleverly suggests replacing shiro powder with chickpea flour and a homemade blend of berbere spice. You\u2019ll be transported as your kitchen fills with the aroma of toasting warm spices and ground chilies. Traditionally, shiro is served alongside cooked greens and injera or other flatbreads. But it\u2019s also delicious spread in a thick layer atop sourdough toast rubbed with garlic and finished with slices of tomato and a fried egg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/01/magazine/01mag-Eat/01mag-Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings (about 5 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "ethiopian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "chickpea flour, garlic, jalape\u00f1o, onion, tomato, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 580}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (1-inch) cinnamon stick", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "6 green cardamom pods", "3 allspice berries", "4 dried chiles de \u00e1rbol, stemmed and seeded", "1/4 cup dried onion flakes", "3 tablespoons sweet paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1 large red onion, coarsely chopped", "10 garlic cloves, peeled", "1/2 cup canola oil", "2 tablespoons homemade or store-bought berbere spice mix", "Fine sea salt", "3 medium vine-ripened tomatoes (about 11 ounces), coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup chickpea flour", "1 to 2 jalape\u00f1os, stemmed and thinly sliced", "Injera or baguette, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the spice mix: Place cinnamon, coriander, fenugreek, peppercorns, cardamom and allspice in a small heavy skillet set over medium heat.
