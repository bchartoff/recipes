{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Air-Fryer French Fries", "description": "Being able to cook French fries with a lot less oil is one of the reasons air fryers were invented. While air-fryer fries may not be quite as deeply crunchy as their properly deep-fried cousins, they are nonetheless crisp, golden and satisfying in their own right \u2014 and a lot easier and less messy to prepare. Here, they\u2019re served with mayonnaise spiked with mustard and smoked paprika, for dunking. But for traditionalists, ketchup works just as well. Note that you can double the recipe, but you may have to cook the fries in batches, depending on the size of your fryer; consult the manual for specific instructions for your model.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/dining/02airfry/02airfry-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "potato, sour cream, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 83}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 377, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "414 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large russet potato (about 8 ounces), cut into 1/4-inch-thick sticks", "1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1/4 cup mayonnaise", "2 tablespoons sour cream or plain whole-milk Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put potatoes in a large bowl and cover with cold water.
