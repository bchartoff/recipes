They\u2019re the flavors of fall and winter, and especially of the holidays; that their aromas linger in the kitchen is a bonus. They\u2019re warm and hearty enough to hold their own when blended with the cake\u2019s apple cider and molasses (use an unsulfured brand, such as Grandma\u2019s). The batter is very thin, but it bakes up sturdy, easy to cut and ready to be generously filled and covered with cream cheese frosting. The cake is lovely on its own, but it welcomes extras. Ms. Bench decorates hers with almond and candy Christmas trees, but a little crystallized ginger or chocolate is nice too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/03/magazine/03mag-eat/03mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "apple cider, cinnamon, confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, molasses, orange zest, christmas, new year\u2019s day, thanksgiving, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 429}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick baking spray", "2 1/4 cups/290 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), softened", "1 packed cup/220 grams light brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "2 teaspoons freshly grated orange zest", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap)", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters apple cider", "12 ounces/340 grams cream cheese, softened", "3/4 cup/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 cups/740 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "Finely chopped crystallized ginger, chocolate pearls or sprinkles (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
