{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Sweet Potatoes With Horseradish Butter", "description": "This recipe plays velvety, honeyed roasted sweet potatoes against the sharp bite of a fresh horseradish and herb compound butter.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great dish for feeding a crowd at Thanksgiving or another gathering. You can roast the potatoes and make the horseradish butter ahead, then pop them into the oven just 15 minutes before serving, while the turkey rests. If you can\u2019t find fresh horseradish, substitute another aromatic ingredient like garlic, fresh ginger or scallions, adjusting the quantities to taste. You'll need less ginger and garlic than you would horseradish, and probably the same amount of scallions. Taste as you go.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/12/multimedia/clark-sweet-potato/clark-sweet-potato-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 170}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 164, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "147 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/4 cup finely grated fresh horseradish, plus coarsely grated horseradish for garnish if desired", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, more for garnish", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, more for garnish", "3 tablespoons panko bread crumbs", "Finely grated zest and juice of 1/2 lemon", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "2 pounds sweet potatoes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag, combine butter, horseradish, parsley, dill, panko, lemon zest and juice, salt and pepper.
