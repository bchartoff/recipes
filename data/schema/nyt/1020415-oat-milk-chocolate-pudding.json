This 15-minute version is inspired by a recipe from Alice Medrich, the cookbook author, in which she uses both cocoa powder and chocolate, and cornstarch instead of eggs for a pure chocolate flavor (eggs can dilute the subtle notes). Here, nondairy milk is swapped in for the milk and the cream with equally wonderful results. When developing this recipe, we found that oat milk created a pudding with the plushest texture. Soy, almond and coconut milks work, too, although they might impart their own flavor and the pudding texture may vary.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/20/dining/as-vegan-chocolate-pudding/merlin_159056808_5cfcb40e-9674-4613-803e-0f8b66dd1d4d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "for one, quick, weekday, custards and puddings", "keywords": "chocolate, cocoa powder, cornstarch, milk, vanilla, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 783}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/30 grams unsweetened cocoa powder", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 cups/480 milliliters nondairy milk, preferably oat", "3 to 4 ounces/85 to 115 grams bittersweet bar chocolate, finely chopped (see Tip 1)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, use a wooden spoon or silicone spatula to stir together the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt.
