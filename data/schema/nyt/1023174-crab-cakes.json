The recipe, adapted from \u201cGullah Geechee Home Cooking: Recipes From the Matriarch of Edisto Island,\u201d comes from Emily Meggett, one of the most well-respected cooks in the Gullah Geechee community, whose food traditions are built largely on the crabs, shrimp and fish they pull from the water near their homes along the southeastern shoreline. She has made thousands of these using freshly cooked blue crabs, but meat that has already been picked and processed works as well. Be sparing with the bread crumbs, which should just hold the mixture together, then add more if the cakes are falling apart. Make sure the pan is very hot, then reduce the heat the minute they hit the oil. Keep a close eye while they brown. These are lovely bites to start a meal, or can star as supper, alongside rice and fresh vegetables. Ms. Meggett serves them with what she calls pink sauce, which is similar to this\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022373-fry-sauce\">sauce</a>,\u00a0with the addition of grated onion and lemon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/11/dining/09gullah-cookbookrex1/merlin_206402364_7f0f43bc-1264-491f-91c6-e71b37d7731a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 12 large crab cakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "crab meat, mace, self-rising flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 674}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 slices soft white or whole-wheat bread", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter", "1 large onion, grated", "1/4 cup/30 grams self-rising flour (see Tip)", "1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters whole or 2-percent milk", "2 large eggs, beaten", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar", "1/4 teaspoon ground mace", "2 pounds/907 grams lump crab meat, drained if needed", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters vegetable oil, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler to 500 degrees (or its highest setting).
