{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon-Spice Visiting Cake", "description": "Whether you pack this cake as a gift or have it ready when visitors come to you, the imperative to share is implicit in its name. The cake is built for comfort and durability \u2013 make it on Thursday or Friday and have it all weekend. And if it stales, toast it; the heat will intensify the lemon and spice deliciously. The cake is easy to make (no machines needed) and, like all spice cakes, better after a day\u2019s rest. Giving it a swish of warmed marmalade when it comes out of the oven is optional. What shouldn't be passed up is what I call the \u2018lemon trick\u2019: Use your fingertips to rub the recipe\u2019s lemon and sugar together until the sugar is moist and aromatic. This easy step transfers everything essential from the lemon to the cake. Think of it as aromatherapy for the cake and you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/magazine/08ondessert/08ondessert-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H25M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, egg, heavy cream, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2317}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 307, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "196 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter and flour for the pan", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams sugar", "1 large (or 2 small) lemons", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream, at room temperature", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "5 1/2 tablespoons/75 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "1/3 cup marmalade, for glaze (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon water, for glaze (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to 350.
