{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sonoran Carne Asada Tacos", "description": "If you\u2019re trying to replicate the carne asada experience in Sonora, there are rules to follow: Diezmillo (chuck roll) and palomilla or aguay\u00f3n (top sirloin) are the traditional meats of choice. The first brings a deep beef flavor and a sturdy chew, while the second has a milder taste and a tender bite. Use one or the other, or a combination. Either way, they need to be sliced to 1/2-inch thickness, grilled over high heat, and seasoned with a generous amount of salt \u2014 and only salt \u2014 right as they are thrown on the grill. They should be flipped just once, when meat juices rise and start to bubble, allowed to rest covered, and then thinly sliced or diced into bite-size pieces. There is no carne asada just for the meat, though the meat turns out as tasty as can be, but it should end up in a taco that should have trouble closing (with its proper accompaniments of refried beans, guacamole and salsa) and should be eaten in good company.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10carneasadarex6-tacos/merlin_175265379_59bb2696-835f-43fe-8f19-d03031e29894-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, meat, tacos, main course", "keywords": "chuck steak, flour tortillas, guacamole, refried beans, sirloin, white onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 380}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 large white onion, for cleaning the grill", "Beef fat (cut from the meat, if fatty), tallow or vegetable oil, for greasing the grill", "2 pounds chuck roll, sliced into 1/2-inch steaks", "2 pounds top sirloin, sliced into 1/2-inch steaks", "4 teaspoons kosher or sea salt, or to taste (about 1 teaspoon per pound of meat)", "Frijoles de Fiesta (Fiesta Refried Beans) (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021290-refried-beans\">see recipe</a>)", "Salsa Tatemada Norte\u00f1a (Fire-Roasted Salsa) (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021291-fire-roasted-salsa\">see recipe</a>)", "Chile Verde Guacamole (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021293-guacamole\">see recipe</a>)", "12 to 16 large (8-inch) flour tortillas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start a charcoal or gas grill, and get it very hot.
