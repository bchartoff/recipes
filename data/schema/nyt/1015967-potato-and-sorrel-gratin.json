I love the tangy flavor of this green leafy vegetable and will always buy it if I see it in my farmers\u2019 market. You don\u2019t need much to contribute lots of lemony flavor and vitamins C, A, iron, calcium and magnesium. The gratin is not a typical creamy sliced potato gratin; it\u2019s more like a potato pie. I cook the potatoes first, then slice or dice and toss with the wilted sorrel, eggs, milk and cheese.
