{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Refried Bean, Zucchini and Corn Gratin", "description": "This is my own interpretation of a traditional Southwestern dish (that has many interpretations) called Three Sisters Casserole. Three Sisters refers to the Native American practice of growing corn, beans and squash in the same field. I\u2019ve seen many different recipes for Three Sisters Casserole and Three Sisters Gratin, some using winter squash, more using summer squash. Sometimes the vegetables are combined and topped with a layer of polenta. In this version, each element gets its own flavorful layer. Although you can use canned beans for the dish, I urge you to use simmered beans because the refried beans will taste best if you reduce them in their flavorful broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/10/health/11recipehealth/11recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, side dish, zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 222}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 524, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "16 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1021 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups simmered black beans or pinto beans, with liquid (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016030-a-big-pot-of-simmered-pintos\">see recipe</a>)", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or sunflower oil", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds, ground", "1 chipotle in adobo, seeded and minced (optional)", "Salt to taste", "1 teaspoon mild or hot chili powder (more to taste)", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup minced onion", "Salt to taste", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 1/2 pounds zucchini or mixed zucchini and yellow squash, sliced about 1/4 inch thick", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon oregano, preferably Mexican oregano, to taste", "2 cups corn kernels (fresh or frozen)", "1 1/4 cups milk", "1 serrano chile, minced", "1/4 cup cornmeal or polenta", "Salt to taste", "1/2 cup grated asadero, Monterey Jack or pecorino", "1/4 cup crumbled queso cotijo, queso fresco, or feta", "1 tablespoon butter or extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
