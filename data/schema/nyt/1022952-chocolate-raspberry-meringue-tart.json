{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Raspberry Meringue Tart", "description": "Scarlet threads of freeze-dried raspberry powder and streaks of bittersweet chocolate add richness and flair to this fluffy-topped meringue tart. It does take time to make, but many of the steps can be done in advance, and this stunning, intensely fruity confection is well worth planning for. The dough, filling and raspberry powder can be prepared up to five days ahead, then make the meringue just before the tart is baked. It\u2019s at its best served on the same day as baking. Store leftovers in a sealed container at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/09/dining/07apperex3-raspberry/merlin_201071094_92d6b2a2-83f7-47f0-8127-9a9cfed973cc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 274}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons/235 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling dough", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Pinch of salt", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, cold and cubed", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "2 cups/260 grams frozen (or fresh) raspberries", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters freshly squeezed lemon juice", "3 egg yolks", "1 large egg", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "Pinch of salt", "3/4 cup/20 grams freeze-dried raspberries", "1 tablespoon unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped", "4 egg whites, at room temperature", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the tart dough: Place the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor.
