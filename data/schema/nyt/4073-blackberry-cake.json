The berries are scattered over the batter, which rises and cooks around them. The cake is fairly dry because it is intended to be served with whipped cream or ice cream. It makes a great finale to a barbecue or cookout.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Moira Hodgson"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "blackberries, cake flour, eggs, dessert, nut-free, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 29}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 315, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "230 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups cake flour", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "2 teaspoons cream of tartar", "12 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature", "1 1/4 cups sugar", "3 large eggs", "1 pint blackberries (approximately 2 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

With the paddle attachment on an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until white and fluffy. Add one egg and mix at medium speed until smooth.

Add one-third of the flour mixture, then the second egg, another third of the flour, the last egg, and the rest of the flour, stopping to scrape the bowl after each addition. Continue mixing at medium speed until the batter is very smooth, about 10 minutes. (It is important to beat enough air into the batter to make it very light. If you skimp on the mixing time, your cake will be too dense and will not rise to its potential)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Smooth the surface with a rubber scraper or the back of a spoon, then scatter berries on top in a single layer. (The berries will sink and be covered as the cake rises.)

A knife inserted in cake should come out clean except for berry juice.
