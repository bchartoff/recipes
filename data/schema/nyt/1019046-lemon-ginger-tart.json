{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon-Ginger Tart", "description": "Somewhere between a lemon bar and a lemon pie lies this ultra tangy tart. \"Tart\" makes it sound difficult, but it's easier than you think: The rich filling requires zero cooking, and the crust is a simple shortbread that you just press into place. The already vibrant yellow filling gets an assist from a bit of ground turmeric. It's an ingredient that you won\u2019t taste as much as you\u2019ll see, but it just so happens to pair perfectly with the freshly grated ginger. It's an extra step, but don't skip straining the filling. It will get rid of any lumps that the whisk couldn\u2019t tackle and will prevent those unsightly air bubbles that can rise to the top after baking. The lemon slices, while optional, are not frivolous: They add a bit of texture and welcome bitterness to the tart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/01/dining/01COOKING-LEMONGINGERTART3/01COOKING-LEMONGINGERTART3-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 416}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 460, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "66 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "320 milligrams", "sugarContent": "42 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/192 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/82 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3/4 cup/170 grams (1 \u00bd sticks) unsalted butter, melted", "1 cup/240 milliliters fresh lemon juice", "1 1/4 cup/252 grams granulated sugar", "4 large egg yolks", "1 large egg", "1/4 cup/32 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 lemon, thinly sliced, seeds removed (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Heat the oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl.
