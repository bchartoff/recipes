{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi Soondubu Jjigae", "description": "This classic Korean stew features silken tofu in a fiery kimchi broth. While kimchi jjigae traditionally starts with browning thinly sliced pork, this vegetarian version features mushrooms instead for a similarly meaty texture. Dried kelp deepens the broth\u2019s flavor with subtle briny notes; reserved kelp can be chopped and tossed in soy sauce and sesame oil for a fun side dish or topping for rice. Be sure to use well-fermented kimchi for an intense broth that is spicy, tart and pungent all at once. Leftover stew makes a fantastic base for ramen noodle soup the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/20/dining/kc-kimchi-soondubu-jjigae/kc-kimchi-soondubu-jjigae-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 566}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (6-inch) square dried kelp (also called dashima or kombu)", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola oil", "4 ounces white button or cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced (2 cups)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 scallions, finely sliced, plus more for garnish", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red-pepper flakes)", "2 cups chopped kimchi plus 1/4 cup kimchi juice", "1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1 medium zucchini (6 ounces), quartered lengthwise and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1 1/2 pounds silken tofu, broken into large pieces", "4 large eggs (optional)", "Steamed short grain rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, combine kelp and 6 cups of water, and bring to a simmer over high.
