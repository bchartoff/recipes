{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Julienne Carrot Salad", "description": "Sometimes a classic, masterfully executed salad is just what you want, and the easier the better. Enter this simple French salad, also known as called carottes r\u00e2p\u00e9es. It is grated carrots dressed with a simple vinaigrette; a lemony one works well. I prefer to cut the carrots into a fine julienne rather than use a box grater, which makes them a bit raggedy. The julienne carrots have a more appealing texture, and they look gorgeous piled on a platter, scattered with chives. It\u2019s not necessary to stay absolutely traditional with this salad. I often veer North African with it, adding pinches of cumin, cinnamon and hot pepper. Nor would it be out of place to introduce Vietnamese seasonings like cilantro, mint, fish sauce and lime.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/carrotsalad/carrotsalad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "carrot, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 117}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 135, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "266 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound medium carrots", "1 small shallot, finely diced", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated garlic", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel carrots and cut into fine julienne.
