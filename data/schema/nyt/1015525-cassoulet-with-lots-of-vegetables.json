(That probably makes it more, not less, traditional, since meat was always hard to come by before the mid-20th century.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/23/dining/Cassoulet/Cassoulet-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "chicken, pork, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 134}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 363, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "16 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1106 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 pound Italian sausages, bone-in pork chops, confit duck legs, or duck breasts, or a combination", "1 tablespoon chopped garlic", "2 leeks or onions, trimmed, washed, and sliced", "2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch lengths", "3 celery stalks, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 medium zucchinis or 1 small head green cabbage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 cups chopped tomatoes, with their juice (canned are fine)", "1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley leaves", "1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme leaves", "2 bay leaves", "4 cups cooked white beans (canned are OK), drained and liquid reserved in any case", "2 cups stock, dry red wine, bean cooking liquid, or water, plus more as needed", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add the meat, and cook, turning as needed, until the meat is deeply browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
