{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Swordfish With Lemon and Fennel", "description": "This dish is truly clever weeknight cooking \u2014 sophisticated, fast, unfussy and wholly delicious. Swordfish is cut into chunks, which cook faster than steaks, and then is saut\u00e9ed in olive oil, butter or, for the best results, a combination of the two. The fat protects the fish from the heat of the pan, preventing the fish from drying out. It also provides lots of flavor, as do fennel seeds, garlic, lemon zest and red pepper flakes, which are added to the pan after the fish has cooked for a few minutes. Fennel fronds are a nice garnish, offering their light anise flavor and feathery texture, though you could use chopped fresh basil, parsley or cilantro instead. Cumin or coriander seeds can stand for the fennel seeds, or you can leave them out altogether and double the chile.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/Swordfish-With-Lemon-and-Fennel/Swordfish-With-Lemon-and-Fennel-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "main course, swordfish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 496}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 323, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "448 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds swordfish steaks, about 1-inch thick", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds", "1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 tablespoon butter", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "Finely grated zest of 1/2 lemon", "1/4 teaspoon crushed red chile flakes, more to taste", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh fennel fronds", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a sharp knife, cut the skin off the swordfish, then cut the fish into 1-inch cubes.
