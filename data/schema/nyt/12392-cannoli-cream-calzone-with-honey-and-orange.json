Easy and crowd pleasing, it\u2019s a good vehicle for using up odds and ends in the fridge. Taking a cue from Lucali\u2019s Nutella-drizzled calzone, I attempted my own dessert version. I mixed honey, cinnamon and orange zest into ricotta before filling the pizza dough (the same one used for a savory calzone), then I dusted the top with powdered sugar after baking. A sprinkle of sea salt lent a savory contrast to this most sweet endeavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/30/dining/calazone/calazone-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "quick, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "dessert, honey, pizza dough, ricotta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 364, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "421 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Extra virgin olive oil, as needed", "1 1/4 cups fresh ricotta", "1 1/2 tablespoons honey, more as needed", "Finely grated zest of 1 orange", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 8-ounce ball pizza dough, divided into 2 pieces", "All-purpose flour, as needed", "1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt", "Confectioners' sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 500 degrees.
