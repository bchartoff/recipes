{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Ranch Dressing", "description": "The original dressing served in the 1950s at Hidden Valley Ranch, a guest ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., was made mostly from dry herbs and aromatics. To recreate that taste, this recipe is made with garlic powder instead of garlic, dried parsley instead of fresh, and so on. It makes enough seasoning mix for about 4 cups dressing; you can mix it, store it, then add dairy as needed. If you don\u2019t like the zip of mustard, try hot sauce or Worcestershire sauce instead \u2014 or simply omit for a milder taste. To make a thick dip instead of a pourable dressing, reduce the amount of buttermilk to 1/4 cup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/dining/19Ranchrex1/merlin_143599344_42942a8a-c6d8-4825-988c-5066d7be73f4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 5 cups dressing", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, salads and dressings", "keywords": "buttermilk, dried chives, dried dill, dried parsley, mayonnaise, sour cream, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 222}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 34, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "65 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons dried chives", "1 teaspoon dried parsley", "1 teaspoon dried dill", "1 tablespoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon mustard powder (optional)", "2 tablespoons buttermilk powder (optional)", "1/2 cup chilled sour cream or mayonnaise", "1/2 cup chilled buttermilk", "Salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the seasoning mix: In a bowl, whisk all the ingredients together.
