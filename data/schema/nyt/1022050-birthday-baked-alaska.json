It\u2019s easy to make; it\u2019s convenient (it must be made ahead); it\u2019s got ice cream (enough said); it\u2019s got meringue \u2014 which is the same as saying it\u2019s got magic. It looks gorgeous whole and just as gorgeous sliced; it\u2019s creamy and icy cold inside, marshmallowy all around and warm on the edges. In other words, it\u2019s perfect. This one was made in the colors of the French flag to celebrate the 117th birthday of the French nun, Sister Andr\u00e9. Reverse the colors for the Fourth of July \u2014 it\u2019s what the creator of this recipe, Zo\u00eb Fran\u00e7ois, did originally \u2014 or use whatever flavors of ice cream you love; the loaf pan will hold 2 quarts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/04/magazine/04mag-eat/04mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "ice cream, kirsch, ladyfingers, strawberries, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 583}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/125 grams sliced fresh strawberries (cut 1/4-inch thick; not thicker)", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons fresh lime or lemon juice", "1 pint/480 milliliters premium or homemade blueberry ice cream", "1 pint/480 milliliters premium or homemade vanilla ice cream", "1 cup/120 grams shredded, sweetened coconut", "1 quart/960 milliliters premium or homemade strawberry ice cream", "Enough ladyfingers to cover the bottom of the cake (about 10 to 20, depending on their size)", "1 cup/240 milliliters egg whites (from about 8 large eggs)", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters kirsch (omit if using a torch)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Line a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap or parchment paper, leaving an overhang."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the sliced strawberries, sugar, and lime or lemon juice in a small bowl, stir and set aside for 2 hours while you put together the rest of the cake."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Each type of ice cream has to be softened before you can use it, so, as you need it, cut it into hunks, put the pieces in a large bowl, and bash and beat them with a sturdy flexible spatula or wooden spoon until spreadable.
