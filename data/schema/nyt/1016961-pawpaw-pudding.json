We went to a bunch of experts \u2014 scholars who specialize in fruit, plus chefs and cookbook authors who know all about the proud culinary history of Appalachia \u2014 and we asked them, \u201cIf a home cook doesn\u2019t happen to have any pawpaw, what combination of other fruits and vegetables might work well as a replacement?\u201d We picked up passing nods to sweet potatoes, bananas, papayas, avocados, really ripe mangoes. But in the end everyone came back with variations on \u201cForget it, there\u2019s nothing like a pawpaw.\u201d\n\nThe weird, goopy-textured, tropical-ish fruit whose name sounds like a punch line on \u201cHee Haw\u201d can be found scattered all over the country, but recipes (for cakes, pies, puddings) abound largely in West Virginia and nearby states like Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana. If you happen to secure some pawpaw, best to get out of its way, as is the case with this pudding.
