Brush the top lightly with oil, then top with a thin layer of marinara sauce (no more than 1/4\u00bc cup) and a layer of fennel. Arrange the olives, if using, here and there, and sprinkle with thyme and Parmesan. Drizzle on a little more olive oil. Slide the pizza back onto the grill. If using a gas grill, reduce the heat to medium-high. Close the lid and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes, until the bottom is brown. Open the grill and check the pizza. The top should be hot and the bottom nicely browned. If the bottom is getting too dark but the pizza still needs a little more time, move it to a cooler part of the grill and close the top. Use a spatula or tongs to remove the pizza to a cutting board. Sprinkle with torn or cut basil leaves. Cut into wedges and serve. Repeat with the other two crusts."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014842-grilled-pizza-with-grilled-fennel-and-parmesan"}
