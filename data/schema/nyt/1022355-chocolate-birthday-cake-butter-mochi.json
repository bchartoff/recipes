This recipe from the chef Sheldon Simeon and Garrett Snyder\u2019s 2021 book, \u201cCook Real Hawai\u2019i,\u201d takes chocolate butter mochi to the max with a creamy peanut butter topping and lots and lots of candy. Add the Pop Rocks just before serving; the candy has a tendency to ping off as it reacts with the moisture in the frosting.
