Even when they soften, after 20 minutes of braising or stewing, they still have plenty of texture, their color remains good and they become somewhat juicy. If you can\u2019t find romano beans use regular green beans. Just reduce cooking time to 15 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/05/dining/05MARTHA/05MARTHA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, lunch, quick, snack, vegetables", "keywords": "feta, romano beans, tomato, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 95}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 119, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "476 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large red onion, finely chopped", "Salt", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "1 1/2 pounds fresh romano beans, trimmed and cut in 2- to 3-inch lengths", "1 cup grated or chopped peeled tomatoes (about 3/4 pound)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh dill", "Ground black pepper", "Feta cheese for topping", "Cooked pasta or grains, such as bulgur, quinoa, polenta or brown rice (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat in a wide, lidded skillet or Dutch oven and add onion and a pinch of salt.
