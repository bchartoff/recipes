{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon Burgers", "description": "For this recipe, you\u2019ll want to grind part of the salmon in a food processor: It\u2019ll bind the rest, which can be coarsely chopped to retain moisture during cooking. Some bread crumbs keep the burger from becoming as densely packed as (bad) meatloaf. This approach, along with a few simple seasonings, produces delicious burgers in not much more time than it takes to make one from ground chuck. The only real trick is to avoid overcooking. Whether you saut\u00e9, broil or grill this burger, it's best when the center remains the color of \u2026 salmon. Two or three minutes a side usually does the trick.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/18/dining/salmonburger2/salmonburger-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, burgers", "keywords": "bread crumbs, capers, dijon mustard, fish, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1540}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless salmon", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 shallots, peeled and cut into chunks", "1/2 cup coarse bread crumbs", "1 tablespoon capers, drained", "Salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons butter or olive oil", "Lemon wedges", "Tabasco sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the salmon into large chunks, and put about a quarter of it into the container of a food processor, along with the mustard.
