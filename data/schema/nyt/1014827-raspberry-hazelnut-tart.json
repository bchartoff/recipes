If you\u2019re a fan of Recipes for Health, or any of her cookbooks on healthful eating, you may be confused by this revelation. But, as she wrote in 2013, \"I believe in a balanced diet, and sweets have a place in it; a little bit of chocolate can do a world of good.\" Enter this delectable  hazelnut tart that she adapted from a recipe by the pastry chef Jacquy Pfeiffer, who founded the French Pastry School in Chicago.
