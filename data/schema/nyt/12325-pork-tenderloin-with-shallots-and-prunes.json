{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Tenderloin With Shallots and Prunes", "description": "Porc aux pruneaux, which is a classic, is by no means fancy, and it is always much more old-fashioned bistro or grandmotherly than high end. Simply put, it is a pork roast with red-wine-soused prunes. Hardly elegant, although it doesn\u2019t have to be heavy either. In France, countless versions of the dish are made in neighborhood joints and at home. Sometimes a large loin or shoulder roast is used, sometimes pan-fried chops. Here we use a lightly brined pork tenderloin, adding stewed shallots to the sauce for depth and texture, and a touch of ginger for brightness. While the roast is in the oven, the shallots simmer with the wine and prunes for the sauce. The dark red sauce (rather unctuous really) is both sweet and tart, with a boozy hint of Madeira. It strikes a Middle European chord somewhere deep within. Serve with sweet potatoes or garnet yams roasted in their skins.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/07/dining/07KITCH_SPAN/07KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, pork tenderloin, prune, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 168}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 396, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "809 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons kosher salt", "3 tablespoons brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon allspice berries, crushed", "1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed", "2 bay leaves", "Few thyme branches", "1 pork tenderloin, trimmed, about 1 pound", "4 ounces pitted prunes, about 16 large", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1/2 teaspoon grated ginger", "1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 tablespoon butter", "3 to 4 large shallots, finely diced, about 1/3 cup", "1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme", "Salt and pepper", "1 1/2 cups chicken broth", "1 tablespoon Madeira or port, optional", "2 teaspoons potato starch dissolved in 2 tablespoons cold water."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To brine the pork: Dissolve the salt and brown sugar in 2 cups cold water in a glass or stainless steel bowl large enough to hold the tenderloin.
