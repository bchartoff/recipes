{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tian", "description": "The tian is both a vessel and the name of what\u2019s cooked in it: summer vegetables, sliced quite thin, arranged in careful layers, drenched in quality olive oil and then cooked in a slow oven until each individual vegetable surrenders to the others, becoming one. The true and complete melding of earthy zucchini, sweet onion, waxy potato, juicy and acidic tomatoes is the great achievement of a well-made tian, and resting the finished dish after cooking is no small part of that success. By using a cast-iron pan and starting on the stovetop during the build, covering with a lid along the way, you speed up the cooking significantly. Season every layer and generously drizzle each with olive oil to bring out tremendous flavor and aroma. The Sungold tomatoes are beautiful and bright and quite acidic \u2014 perfect against the other flavors \u2014 but I find the skins unpleasantly leathery-papery when they are cooked, so simply peel them first. Dropping the tomatoes for 30 seconds into seasoned boiling water splits their skins readily and they slip off effortlessly. I would even say it\u2019s kind of fun.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/30/magazine/30mag-eat/30mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "bread crumbs, cherry tomatoes, onion, potato, zucchini, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1412}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (about 12 ounces)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large yellow onion (about 12 ounces)", "2 zucchini (about 12 ounces), washed and wiped free of any clinging grit", "1 pint yellow Sungold cherry tomatoes", "1/3 cup coarse bread crumbs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a pot, boil 2 inches of water for blanching tomatoes.
