{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Galbi (Korean-Style Short Ribs)", "description": "This dish, known as galbi, is a fine thing to eat in a restaurant, but it also makes for a wonderful and easy meal at home. If you buy English-style short ribs, which are cut along the bone, you must butterfly the meat into a thin, long strip. If the ribs you buy are flanken-style, in which a band saw is used to cut across the ribs, creating half-inch slices of beef dotted with three little bones, rinse them under cold water before seasoning to remove any bone fragments. It\u2019s a good idea to let the ribs marinate for at least two hours to allow the seasoning to penetrate; marinating overnight is even better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/20/dining/20KITCH1_SPAN/20KITCH1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 20 slices, 4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "brown sugar, food processor, gochujang, plan-ahead, short ribs, soy sauce, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1223}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 993, "unsaturatedFatContent": "43 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "85 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "36 grams", "sodiumContent": "894 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds short ribs, cut in 1/2-inch slices across the bones (flanken-style)", "1/3 cup soy sauce", "1/3 cup brown sugar", "1/3 cup rice wine", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "2 teaspoons black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne or gochujang", "1 medium onion, peeled and quartered", "8 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 small Asian pear, peeled, cored and quartered (or use an ordinary pear or tart apple)", "1 1-inch chunk of ginger, peeled", "2 teaspoons sesame seeds", "Lettuce leaves", "Sliced red or green hot pepper, optional", "Ssamjang (spicy Korean soybean paste), for dipping, optional", "Steamed rice, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse short ribs in cold water, pat dry and place in a wide shallow bowl.
