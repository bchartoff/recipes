{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fast No-Knead Whole Wheat Bread", "description": "This recipe is a variation on the original no-knead bread, which Mark Bittman learned from the baker Jim Lahey. It's an attempt to bake a loaf with a higher percentage of whole grain. The results are wonderful: you can use 100 percent whole grains, you can vary their percentages all you want (though all-rye bread doesn\u2019t rise much at all) and you can add nongrain flours, sweeteners or dairy. If the proportions of liquid, solid and yeast stay the same, the timing and results will be consistent.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/21/dining/21COOKING-NO-KNEAD-WHEAT-BREAD2/21COOKING-NO-KNEAD-WHEAT-BREAD2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "1 loaf", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, project", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, bread", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 314}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 224, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "147 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups whole wheat flour", "1/2 cup whole rye flour", "1/2 cup coarse cornmeal", "1 teaspoon instant yeast", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "Oil as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine flours, cornmeal, yeast and salt in a large bowl.
