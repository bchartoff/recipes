The pasta is cooked in the sauce instead of in a separate pot of boiling water? The broccoli is cooked until it\u2019s mushy enough to become sauce? Yes and yes, and for very good reasons. The sauce, sweet from simmered-until-tender broccoli and savory with loads of garlic and anchovy, tastes lovingly coddled, like you <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022378-long-cooked-broccoli\">cooked that broccoli forever</a>. But you know the truth: It came together in minutes. You don\u2019t have to wait for a big pot of water to come to a boil, but more important, the pasta and sauce have a symbiotic relationship. The pasta soaks up the sauce flavors from the start, and the pasta releases starch to help turn the water into a creamy sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/dining/18PASTAREX4-skillet-broccoli/merlin_205476498_b4e05dbb-1485-48e9-8b63-d0ac415ecef0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastas, main course", "keywords": "anchovy, broccoli, spaghetti", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1651}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 garlic cloves", "1 1/2 pounds broccoli", "1/4 cup unsalted butter", "4 anchovy fillets", "12 ounces spaghetti (or another pasta that cooks in 10 minutes)", "Kosher salt", "\u00bd teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Grated Parmesan, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Thinly slice the garlic and transfer to a large (12-inch) skillet with high sides.
