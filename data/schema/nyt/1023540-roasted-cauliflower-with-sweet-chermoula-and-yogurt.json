{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Cauliflower With Sweet Chermoula and Yogurt", "description": "Chermoula is a common Moroccan marinade traditionally used to season dishes such as roasted vegetables and fish. This is a sweeter version of the sauce with extra lemon juice and honey to bring out the nuances of the herbs and spices. Serve this dish as a main with flatbread or as a side with roasted chicken or a grilled steak. Make a large batch of the sweet chermoula and keep it in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can use it to season roasted vegetables, cooked proteins and drizzle over salads or grain bowls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nargisse Benkabbou"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/13/dining/nb-cauliflower-with-sweet-chermoula/nb-cauliflower-with-sweet-chermoula-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cauliflower, cilantro, greek yogurt, ground cumin, honey, sweet paprika, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 215}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving", "3 tablespoons honey", "3 garlic cloves, peeled and grated or smashed into a paste", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 cup finely chopped cilantro", "3 teaspoons sweet paprika", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 teaspoon fine salt, or more to taste", "1 medium cauliflower, cut into florets (about 4 cups)", "1 cup plain Greek yogurt, for serving", "1 tablespoon toasted sliced almonds, for serving", "Handful of cilantro leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sweet chermoula: To a large mixing bowl add the olive oil, honey, garlic, lemon juice, cilantro, paprika, cumin, salt and a tablespoon of water, and stir together until they are well combined."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the cauliflower florets to the bowl and use your hands or two large spoons to mix them with the chermoula, making sure that each floret is properly coated.
