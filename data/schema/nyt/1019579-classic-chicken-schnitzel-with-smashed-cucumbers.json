{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Chicken Schnitzel With Smashed Cucumbers", "description": "If making chicken schnitzel sounds hard, perhaps it\u2019s because you\u2019ve never tried. The technique itself is so simple, effective and addictive that you might find yourself turning to it all the time. For the crispest crust, you'll want to keep the hot oil circling the schnitzel as it cooks, creating a little space between the crust and the chicken. As for the side, giving your cucumbers and green beans a good whack with the rolling pin opens them up and creates crevices that soak up the harissa and garlic. Be generous with the squeezes of lemon at the end. They'll bring the chicken and spiced cucumbers to their fullest flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/dining/sc-schnitzel/sc-schnitzel-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "german", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken breast, cucumber, green beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 114}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 866, "unsaturatedFatContent": "50 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "68 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "605 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 small Persian or hothouse cucumbers (about 14 ounces)", "About 4 ounces green beans, trimmed and halved", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "4 garlic cloves, smashed", "2 eggs, lightly beaten", "1 1/4 cups unseasoned panko bread crumbs", "1/2 cup flour", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "2 large chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds), split in half crosswise and pounded 1/8-inch thick", "Black pepper, for seasoning", "Peanut oil, for frying", "1 teaspoon harissa", "2 lemons, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Smash cucumbers with a rolling pin on a large cutting board, to split them open.
