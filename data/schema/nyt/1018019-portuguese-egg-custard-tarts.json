{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Portuguese Egg Custard Tarts", "description": "These diminutive egg tarts \u2014 pasteis de nata \u2014 a specialty all over Portugal, have a cinnamon flavored custard nestled in a flaky puff pastry crust. The trick here is to bake them in a very hot oven, which causes the custard to puff and the pastry to turn brown and crunchy. You can make the crust and filling ahead, but don\u2019t bake them more than an hour or two before serving. They\u2019re at their best still warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/16/dining/16APPY3/16APPY3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "48 tarts", "recipeCuisine": "portuguese", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, egg, milk, puff pastry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 264}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 486, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "58 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "162 milligrams", "sugarContent": "29 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 ounces all-butter puff pastry, thawed if frozen", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 cup plus 6 tablespoons/330 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/65 grams all-purpose flour", "6 large egg yolks", "Ground cinnamon, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a lightly floured surface, roll puff pastry into an 18-inch/46-centimeter square.
