Keep an eye on the dough rather than the clock when assessing the rise. The additional sugar, eggs and butter can slow things down. Give the yeast plenty of time to work, and you\u2019ll be handsomely rewarded with light, pillowy rolls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/dining/02COOKING-HAWAIIAN-BUNS1/02COOKING-HAWAIIAN-BUNS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "16 rolls", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "flour, pineapple juice, yeast, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 118}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 153, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "125 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup pineapple juice", "1 (1/4-ounce/2 1/4 teaspoons/7 grams) package active dry yeast", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "3 1/4 cup/415 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 large egg plus 2 large egg yolks, lightly beaten", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, bring the pineapple juice to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook it until it has reduced to 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes.
