{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple Chicken \u2018n\u2019 Ribs", "description": "If meat is involved, you can find me covering it in flavor-enhancing tenderizing liquids before grilling, broiling, baking or roasting it. The more you do to the meat before you cook it, the less you have to do during or after. In this case apple juice or cider gives tang and wards off stringiness, a small amount of oil keeps things juicy and maple syrup, soy, star anise, cinnamon and garlic impart deep, luscious flavor. These two meats work well in conjunction: the relatively lean chicken is enhanced in taste and texture by the pork ribs, which give off flavorsome fat as they roast. You can use whatever ribs you like; meaty ones are best, but as long as the ribs are separated, rather than in a slab, they'll do just fine. As for the chicken, I implore you to use thighs, bone-in, skin-on because the meat is more tender and the taste infinitely better. (Make sure you use a large enough roasting pan so you don't have to crowd the pan. If the pan is crowded, the meat will steam, not brown.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/07/dining/07COOKING-MAPLE-CHICKNRIBS2/07COOKING-MAPLE-CHICKNRIBS2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "barbecues, poultry, project", "keywords": "chicken, maple syrup, ribs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 105}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 833, "unsaturatedFatContent": "38 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "63 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "534 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup apple cider or juice, as sharp as possible", "1/4 cup maple syrup", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 star anise", "1 cinnamon stick", "6 unpeeled garlic cloves", "1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes (optional)", "8 pork spareribs, separated", "6 chicken thighs with skin and bone"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small mixing bowl whisk together the apple cider, maple syrup, vegetable oil and soy sauce.
