The author Carolyn Phillips is a proponent of using Korean flour, which is lower in gluten than American all-purpose flour. Adding a layer of oil between the dough before rolling it into a circle is a trick that allows the layers to be peeled apart after cooking for a thinner wrapper.

When the bottom is hot, add 1 wrapper and slowly cook it on one side until the bottom is spotted brown and the top starts to puff up, about 1 minute. Turn the wrapper over and briefly cook it on the other side, then transfer it to a clean tea towel and cover it so that it steams lightly. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers until all are cooked and you have a stack of warm tortillas in your towel. At this point, you will be able to peel them apart, if you wish, for very thin wrappers, or keep them as is for thicker ones."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018334-chinese-wheat-wrappers"}
