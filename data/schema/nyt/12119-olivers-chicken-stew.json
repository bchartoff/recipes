This is like that, but heartier, more healthful and a touch more sophisticated.

Tiny little star pasta (stellini) make it unbearably charming, and a good squeeze of lemon juice brightens it all up. Serve it over slices of toasted Italian bread for the ultimate in comfort food.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jennifer Steinhauer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/25/dining/25COOKING-CHICKENSTEW2/25COOKING-CHICKENSTEW2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken, vegetables, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 508}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 855, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "51 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "52 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "1870 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3 1/2 - to 4-pound chicken, rinsed", "8 cups chicken stock", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "5 medium carrots, thickly sliced", "4 medium leeks, tender white part only, thickly sliced", "4 celery stalks, thickly sliced", "4 cloves garlic, smashed", "1 teaspoon chopped thyme", "1 bay leaf", "3 sprigs flat-leaf parsley", "1/2 cup stellini (tiny star pasta)", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 tablespoon chopped tarragon", "1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "6 slices toasted Italian bread", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the chicken in a 6-quart pot, breast side down.
