{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Clam Fritters", "description": "This is a recipe for classic New England clam fritters prepared as conch fritters are in the Bahamas, with a low zip of jalapeno heat and a high one of lime juice. I serve them with my version of the ubiquitous mayo-ketchup sauce of the Lucayan archipelago. These fritters are terrific when prepared with freshly shucked clams, but if you don\u2019t want to open clams by hand, they are still excellent with lightly steamed ones. A deep cast-iron skillet placed over a gas grill allows you to fry the fritters outdoors if you like, reducing kitchen mess. Or if you don\u2019t wish to fry, you can treat the batter as if it were for pancakes. The flavor abides, if not the full crispiness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/24/magazine/24eat/24mag-24eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings as an appetizer", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, clam juice, clams, jalape\u00f1o, lime, red bell pepper, red onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 740, "unsaturatedFatContent": "66 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "74 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "679 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["36 cherrystone clams", "1 1/2 cups or 180 grams all-purpose flour", "3 large eggs, separated", "1/2 red onion, peeled and diced", "1/2 red pepper, seeded and diced", "2 ribs celery, diced", "2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "1 jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded and diced", "3/4 cup clam broth or clam liquor", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "2 to 3 cups neutral oil, like canola", "2 scallions, chopped", "2 limes, cut into wedges", "3 tablespoons ketchup", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1 tablespoon hot sauce", "3 tablespoons lime juice (the juice of 1 or 2 limes)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Either open the clams by hand, reserving both the juice within them and the clams, or steam the clams until they just open, reserving both the broth and the clams.
