He also adds a measure of brown sugar to the basic formula. The experts are divided as to whether the brown sugar actually contributes flavor or simply makes the brownie moister (molasses, which makes brown sugar brown, is powerfully hydrophilic). It\u2019s my belief that the slightly bitter taste of molasses acts as an invisible enhancer to the chocolate. The result is as complex and sophisticated as any terrine or truffle I have ever produced.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/16/dining/16COOKING_SUPERBROWNIES1/16COOKING_SUPERBROWNIES1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "15 large or 24 small brownies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, cookies and bars", "keywords": "brownies, chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1162}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 318, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "100 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 sticks (16 tablespoons) butter, more for pan and parchment paper", "8 ounces bittersweet chocolate", "1 cup dark brown sugar, such as muscovado", "1 cup granulated sugar", "4 eggs", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 cup flour", "1/2 cup chopped walnuts or 3/4 cup whole walnuts, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking pan and line with buttered parchment paper.
