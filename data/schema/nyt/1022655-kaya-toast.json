{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kaya Toast", "description": "In Malay, kaya translates to rich, which perfectly describes this toasted bread spread with custardy kaya jam and cold salted butter. Kaya toast is popular throughout Malaysia, Singapore and other regions of Southeast Asia where pandan, the star ingredient, grows as a tropical plant with palm-like leaves. Kaya jam is made with fresh pandan, coconut milk, palm sugar and lots of eggs, which make it creamy. In this version, adapted from Kyo Pang, the founder and the executive chef of New York City\u2019s Kopitiam, milk bread slices sandwiching kaya jam come with soy-seasoned half-boiled eggs for dipping.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kiera Wright-Ruiz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/14/dining/KW-kaya-toast/merlin_196072107_65a5903b-1d8b-41c4-84fc-124715e12834-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "malaysian", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, lunch, snack", "keywords": "eggs, milk bread, pandan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 162}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 (13.5-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk", "6 large/45 grams fresh pandan leaves or 1 3/4 teaspoons pandan extract (see Tip)", "1 cup packed/ 300 grams palm sugar or 1 1/4 cups/225 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper (optional)", "4 slices milk bread, crusts cut off (see Tip)", "1 1/2 tablespoons cold salted butter, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the kaya jam: Beat eggs in a large metal bowl.
