{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Chicken With Peppers, Focaccia and Basil Aioli", "description": "Surrounded by caramelized peppers, focaccia croutons \u2014 some crisp, some soaked with vinegar and chicken jus \u2014 and a bright basil aioli, this roast chicken dish is filled with delights that can only be earned through home-cooking and family-style eating. The deliciousness of this recipe relies on layering flavor and encouraging pan juices. Marinate the chicken and peppers generously, seasoning at various stages. Next, place some focaccia underneath the chicken to roast in schmaltz, and tuck smaller shards of the bread like a wreath around the edge of the dish, where they will crisp. If your dish runs dry during cooking, add a splash more vinegar. The basil aioli is crucial, though it doesn\u2019t need to be homemade: Use the best store-bought version you can find and spruce it up with the basil, lemon and garlic paste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clare de Boer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/28/dining/27Diaryrex1/merlin_159056598_cc3d8eb1-5102-4dab-921e-74281f349350-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, roasts", "keywords": "basil, chicken, focaccia, olive oil, red bell pepper, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 150}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole chicken (4 to 5 pounds)", "1 tablespoon dried oregano, preferably wild", "1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons flaky sea salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup good-quality red wine vinegar", "3 red bell peppers", "2 yellow bell peppers", "1 loaf focaccia (about 14 ounces), halved horizontally if thicker than 1 inch", "2 heads garlic, sliced in half widthwise through cloves", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 packed cup fresh basil leaves\u00a0", "1/4 cup lemon juice (from 2 lemons), plus more to taste", "4 cloves garlic, grated", "2 teaspoons flaky sea salt, plus more to taste", "4 egg yolks", "2 2/3 cups extra-virgin olive oil", "Cold water, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chicken: Set the chicken on a work surface breast-side down.
