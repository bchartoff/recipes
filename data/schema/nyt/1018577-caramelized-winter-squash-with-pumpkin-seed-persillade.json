{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Winter Squash With Pumpkin Seed Persillade", "description": "This method of flame-roasting a whole winter squash, just as you would roast a bell pepper, comes from the San Francisco chef Dominique Crenn. Surprisingly, the skin becomes soft, smoky and entirely edible. (The dish can also be made with squash chunks: see note at the end of the recipe.)\n\nCaramelizing the fragrant mash at the last minute brings out the sweetness and smoke, and a fresh herb sauce brings it back to earth. The pumpkin seeds in the garlicky, green sauce, or persillade, echo the flavors of the squash.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/15/dining/15CRENN4/15CRENN4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "bread crumbs, pumpkin seeds, sage, winter squash, side dish, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 284, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "540 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 4 pounds (about 2) whole winter squash, such as butternut, banana or Hubbard (see note)", "1/3 cup sage leaves, loosely packed", "2/3 cup parsley leaves, loosely packed", "Zest of 1 lemon, freshly grated", "2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds", "1 large garlic clove", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt", "Raw sugar or maple syrup", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup coarse bread crumbs, preferably sourdough"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees, or heat a gas grill to high.
