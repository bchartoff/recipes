First, try <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/dining/j-kenji-lopez-alts-secret-ingredient.html\">this trick</a> from J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt for plump meat with a browned crust: Stir a little baking soda into mayonnaise, and season it with salt, garlic and chile, which will intensify in the mayonnaise\u2019s fat. Coat the shrimp in the mayonnaise mixture and refrigerate for up to 30 minutes, then grill mostly on one side to avoid overcooking. Eat over grains, lettuces, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022216-spaghetti-al-limone-with-shrimp\">lemon pasta</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019500-spicy-minced-shrimp-with-rice-noodles\">noodle salad</a>; in tortillas or pita; or popped right into your mouth. As far as seasonings go, start with chile and garlic, then switch up subsequent batches with lemon zest, Old Bay, ginger and more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/11/dining/AS-chile-garlic-shrimp1/AS-chile-garlic-shrimp1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "mayonnaise, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 636}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 garlic cloves", "1/2 to 1 fresh hot chile, such as jalape\u00f1o or Fresno (depending on the chile\u2019s kick and your heat tolerance)", "1/4 cup mayonnaise", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "Heaping 1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails on, patted dry"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for high heat.
