{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spanakopita", "description": "Spanakopita, the classic Greek savory pie, is elegant and impressive, yet easy to make. The star ingredient is spinach, and lots of it (two pounds to be exact). This pie tastes best when made with fresh spinach, though you could also use the same amount of frozen spinach \u2014 just be sure to thaw completely and squeeze out all the excess water before using. This recipe can be baked a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator overnight, then rewarmed at 400 degrees until heated through, about 15 minutes. Cut into small squares or triangles to serve as an appetizer, or for a more complete meal, serve larger squares of the pie alongside soup or salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/14/dining/kc-spanakopita/kc-spanakopita-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "feta, parsley, phyllo, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 183}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup finely chopped onion", "5 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped (about 3/4 cup)", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 pounds baby spinach (32 ounces)", "2 large eggs", "1 1/4 cups crumbled feta (6 ounces)", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan (2 ounces)", "1/2 cup chopped parsley", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "8 sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed and halved crosswise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat oil over medium.
