{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Honey-Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Apples", "description": "Simple enough for weeknights but special enough for holidays, this mix of roasted root vegetables and fruits showcases all the sweetness fall produce has to offer. Because each ingredient roasts differently, you\u2019ll also get various textures, from jammy apples to crisp-tender carrots. Honey accentuates the sweetness, but there\u2019s plenty of room for personal flare. For warmth, roast with 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, cardamom or ginger. For crunch, add chopped nuts to the pan in the last few minutes of roasting. For a little zip, add lemon or orange zest with the red-pepper flakes.
