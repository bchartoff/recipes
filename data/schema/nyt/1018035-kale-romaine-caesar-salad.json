Most recipes focus on flavor; this one also unlocks the Caesar's secrets of temperature, texture, heat and umami. Kale and romaine make an ideal combination of greens, but all romaine or all kale is fine: just stay away from tender, wilting leaves like mesclun and Bibb lettuce. Using strong greens also means that the salad can be tossed up to two hours before serving, as long as it is kept cold.
