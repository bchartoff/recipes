{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "English Muffin Breakfast Casserole", "description": "This easy, make-ahead casserole makes creative use of classic breakfast ingredients like eggs, sausage, Cheddar cheese and English muffins. It\u2019s a perfect no-stress centerpiece for a special-occasion breakfast: Simply assemble the casserole the night before and pop it in the oven before breakfast. Just remember to make sure to toast the English muffins until they\u2019ve dried out a bit, which will help them absorb the egg mixture. For a vegetarian version, use vegetarian sausage or omit it altogether.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/11/dining/lh-english-muffin-breakfast-casserole/lh-english-muffin-breakfast-casserole-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, casseroles", "keywords": "butter, cheddar, eggs, english muffins, milk, sausage, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 770}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan", "6 plain English muffins", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 pound bulk hot or sweet breakfast sausage or Italian sausage", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and green parts (about 3 scallions)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "12 large eggs", "2 1/2 cups whole milk", "2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, lightly packed (about 8 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Generously grease the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with butter.
