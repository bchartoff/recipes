{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broccoli Salad With Cheddar and Warm Bacon Vinaigrette", "description": "Broccoli salads are a dime a dozen, but this one, which is adapted from Ashley Christensen's cookbook, \"Poole's: Recipes From a Modern Diner,\" is a game-changing celebration of flavors, colors and textures: broccoli, toasted pecans and red grapes are cloaked in a warm bacon-scallion vinaigrette, then sprinkled with small chunks of sharp white Cheddar. Ms. Christensen's recipe, which uses the florets as well as the stalks, asks you to blanch the broccoli (cooking it for a few minutes in generously salted boiling water, then shocking it with salted iced water). It takes a little extra time, but the crisp-tender, bright green broccoli, seasoned inside and out, is your just reward. Try not to eat the entire bowl yourself.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28POOLES-WEB1/28POOLES-WEB1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "bacon, broccoli, cheddar, grape, gluten-free, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 741}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 246, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "331 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 bunch broccoli (about 1 1/4 pounds), ends trimmed", "1/2 cup pecan halves", "4 ounces bacon, diced", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "4 green onions, white and light green parts only, chopped", "Black pepper", "1 cup halved red seedless grapes", "4 ounces aged white cheddar, sliced thin and crumbled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of generously salted (use about 1/2 cup kosher salt) water to a boil.
