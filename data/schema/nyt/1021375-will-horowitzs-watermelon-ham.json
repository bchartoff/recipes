{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Will Horowitz\u2019s Watermelon Ham", "description": "When Will Horowitz, a chef and\u00a0an owner of Ducks Eatery in Manhattan, unveiled his watermelon ham in 2018, he sparked an Instagram revolution, inspiring foodies from as far away as Germany and Japan to try incarnadine slabs of his brined, smoked watermelon. It sure looked like ham, right down to the crosshatch scoring on the surface. It sure smelled like ham, fragrant with the smoky scent of hickory. It even had some of the briny umami tang you associate with ham. Though it didn\u2019t really taste like ham, it did firmly establish plant-based charcuterie as a big thing. This watermelon \u201cham\u201d starts with a tamari-herb brine, is smoked low and slow for the first four hours, then seared. This recipe is adapted from \u201cSalt Smoke Time\u201d by Will Horowitz, Julie Horowitz and with Marisa Dobson (William Morrow, 2018).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/26/dining/24charcuterierex1/24charcuterierex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P4DT5H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "main course, side dish", "keywords": "summer, tamari, watermelon, wood ash, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 362}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium seedless watermelon (10 to 12 pounds)", "1 cup wood ash (from your smoker or fireplace) or 2 teaspoons food-grade sodium hydroxide (lye) (see Note)", "3/4 cup kosher salt", "1/4 cup dried oregano leaves", "2 tablespoons cracked black peppercorns", "4 juniper berries, lightly crushed with the side of a cleaver or knife to release the flavor", "3 whole cloves", "2 fresh or dried bay leaves", "3/4 cup tamari", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons for basting", "6 garlic cloves, peeled", "4 (4- to 5-inch) sprigs fresh rosemary", "2 hardwood chunks or 1 1/2 cups wood chips (if using the latter, soak in cold water for 30 minutes then drain), plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the watermelon: Using a sharp knife, cut the top and bottom off the watermelon, removing enough rind just to expose the red flesh.
