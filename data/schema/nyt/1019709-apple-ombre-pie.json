{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Ombr\u00e9 Pie", "description": "This impressive-looking pie is more like a traditional apple tart: Thin slices of apples are tightly arranged, then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. In the oven, the apples soften and create a delicious, jammy base inside a buttery, flaky crust. Grouping the slices by color creates a stunning ombr\u00e9 effect, but the rest of the recipe is simple to make up for the assembly time. The recipe calls for a generous number of apples to be sure you fill the crust; use any leftovers for snacking or to make applesauce. Store any leftovers at room temperature, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/dining/xxombreswap/xxombreswap-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "apple, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 555}, "recipeIngredient": ["<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019713-perfect-pie-crust\">Perfect Pie Crust,</a> prepared for a fruit pie and chilled", "2 medium red apples, such as McIntosh or Cortland", "2 medium pink apples, such as Jonagold, Gala or Fuji", "2 medium yellow-pink or green-pink apples, such as Golden Delicious or Northern Spy", "2 medium green apples, such as Granny Smith", "Lemon juice, as needed", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces", "\u00bc cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "\u00be teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "Egg wash (1 large egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a lightly floured surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out a disk of dough into a circle about \u00bc-inch thick.
