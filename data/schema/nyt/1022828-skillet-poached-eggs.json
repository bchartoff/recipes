{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Poached Eggs", "description": "There\u2019s a little trick here that makes poaching eggs easy and prevents them from spreading into flat, floppy disks: rolling the eggs in the boiling water in their shells before cracking them into the pan. This technique helps them maintain their shape when they\u2019re cracked into the boiling water. Because the whites don\u2019t spread, six eggs can fit in a skillet comfortably without running into one another, and you can serve a crowd with little effort. You can use this move to poach fewer eggs, too, of course. No matter how many you cook, you\u2019ll end up with silky eggs for toast, a breakfast sandwich or as an accompaniment to bacon, sausage, waffles or pancakes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/22/dining/17Korexeggs/merlin_195939375_980c8b90-550c-435a-b9c7-383b6cb63874-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, quick, main course", "keywords": "eggs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 538}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 6 large eggs", "1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar", "Butter and toast, for serving", "Ham and cheese, for serving (optional)", "Salt and pepper, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large skillet, ideally one with straight, tall sides, with water to a depth of 1 1/2 inches.
