{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Steel-Cut Oatmeal With Fruit", "description": "Steel-cut oatmeal is my new favorite hot breakfast. It has more texture than rolled or flaked oats and really sticks to your ribs. But this tasty cereal takes about 25 to 30 minutes to cook \u2014 not what you need when you\u2019re trying to get out the door. So I make a batch that will last a few days; it keeps well in the refrigerator, and you can reheat small portions gently atop the stove or in the microwave. You can also freeze this oatmeal in ice cube trays, an idea I got from oncology nutritionist Maria C. Romano. She contributed the recipe from which this one is adapted to the \u201cEat Healthy, Shop Smart\u201d community farmers\u2019 market program at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/12/07/health/08recipehealth_600/08recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, one pot", "keywords": "dried fruit, steel-cut oats, fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 163}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 149, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "205 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups water", "2 cups low-fat milk", "1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)", "1 cup steel-cut oats", "1 teaspoon unsalted butter (optional)", "2 to 4 tablespoons dried fruit, such as raisins, chopped dried apricots, dried cranberries", "1 to 2 teaspoons maple syrup, agave syrup, honey or brown sugar (more to taste)", "Fresh fruit (such as diced apples and pears, optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the water, milk and salt in a large, heavy saucepan, and bring to a boil.
