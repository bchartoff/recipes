Your croissants need not be stale to achieve wonderfully eggy, cheesy results, but if they are fresh, consider leaving them on the counter to dry out first, or even toasting them briefly in the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/21/dining/21COOKING_FRENCHLASAGNE2/21COOKING_FRENCHLASAGNE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, weekday, casseroles", "keywords": "cheddar, croissants, egg, ham, milk, mozzarella, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 447}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 472, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "722 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups whole milk", "1 clove garlic, peeled and lightly crushed", "4 large eggs, beaten together", "5 stale croissants, halved lengthwise (like sandwiches)", "5 thin slices ham", "1 4-ounce ball fresh mozzarella, cut into 5 slices", "8 ounces grated cheddar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, combine milk and garlic, and place over high heat until almost at boiling point.
