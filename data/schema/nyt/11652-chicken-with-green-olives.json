{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken With Green Olives", "description": "When people speak of Mediterranean food they are most often referring to that of Spain, southern France, Italy and Greece. The conversation occasionally includes the Middle East, but rarely North Africa. The primary reason for this is a lack of exposure, because often when people taste good North African food (no, it isn't all couscous), they become instant converts. The dish here, a classic Moroccan chicken saut\u00e9, is astonishing for its complexity, even in this relatively elementary form. It features sweet spices like cinnamon and ginger offset by garlic and paprika. But what makes it a real winner is the combination of those flavors with lemon and green olives, both of which have a mouth-puckering quality that, combined with the spice mix, is enchanting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/24/dining/24COOKING-CHICKEN-OLIVES2/23COOKING-CHICKEN-OLIVES2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, one pot", "keywords": "chicken, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 313}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 363, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "930 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "3 to 4 pounds leg-thigh pieces of chicken, cut in two, excess fat removed", "Salt and pepper to taste", "1 large onion, chopped", "2 teaspoons peeled and minced ginger", "1 1-inch cinnamon stick, or 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon paprika", "2 cups chicken stock or water", "1 1/2 cups green olives, drained and pitted", "Lemon juice to taste", "Chopped cilantro leaves for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put oil in deep skillet or casserole.
