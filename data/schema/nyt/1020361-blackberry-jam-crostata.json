A touch of whole-wheat flour gives the crust complexity and a gentle nutty flavor, while homemade blackberry jam spiked with lemon verbena makes the confection festive enough for guests. This recipe is adapted from Elizabeth Minchilli, a food writer in Rome, who often buys excellent-quality cherry jam for the filling. If you\u2019d like to substitute store-bought jam, use 1 1/2 cups.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/31/dining/26apperex/26apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, pies and tarts", "keywords": "almond, blackberry, blueberry, lemon, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 250}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/340 grams blackberries", "1 cup/125 grams blueberries", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar, plus more as needed", "2 teaspoons minced fresh lemon verbena (optional)", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/3 cup sliced almonds", "Demerara sugar, for sprinkling", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/95 grams whole-wheat flour", "12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 large egg yolks, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the jam: In a medium saucepan, stir together blackberries, blueberries, sugar and lemon verbena, if using.
