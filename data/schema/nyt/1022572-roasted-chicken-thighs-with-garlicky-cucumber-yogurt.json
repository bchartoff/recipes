{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Chicken Thighs With Garlicky Cucumber Yogurt", "description": "In this simple, homey weeknight dinner, boneless chicken thighs are tossed with garlic, herbs and red-pepper flakes, then roasted along with lemon wedges in the pan. As the lemons brown, their acids mellow, becoming softer and sweeter. When squeezed over the chicken for serving, they offer a rounded tang that\u2019s complemented by dollops of cucumber-flecked yogurt and chopped fresh mint. The combination of cucumbers and yogurt is a classic across many cultures, from Indian <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015024-cucumber-raita\">raita</a> to Persian <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020213-mast-o-khiar-persian-cucumber-and-herb-yogurt\">mast-o khiar</a> to Greek <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016438-tzatziki\">tzatziki</a> and beyond. For this recipe, be sure to use thick Greek-style or other strained yogurt (such as labneh) or substitute sour cream. Thinner yogurt will make the sauce runny. Serve this over rice or with flatbread to catch the juices and the cucumber yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/29/dining/24Appe1/merlin_194652018_a1b38a9e-1ac1-41aa-8fed-24674bdf5f47-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "cucumber, greek yogurt, roast chicken", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1575}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 to 2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs\u00a0", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 garlic cloves, finely grated, minced or passed through a press", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme or oregano leaves, or 1 teaspoon dried thyme or oregano", "Large pinch of red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 lemon, cut lengthwise into thin wedges", "1/2 cup plain Greek or other strained, thick yogurt (or substitute labneh or sour cream)", "1/2 cup grated seedless cucumber, such as Persian or hothouse cucumbers (see Tip)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint (or use parsley or cilantro), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
