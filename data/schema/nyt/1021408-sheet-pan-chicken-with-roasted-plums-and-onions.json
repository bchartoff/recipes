{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Roasted Plums and Onions", "description": "Beautiful to behold and easy to make, this sheet-pan dinner combines sweet plums and soft red onions with crisp-skinned pieces of roasted chicken. Toasted fennel seeds, red-pepper flakes and a touch of allspice add complexity while a mound of fresh torn herbs crowns the top. If good ripe plums aren\u2019t available, you can substitute another stone fruit including peaches, nectarines or pluots, though if your fruit is very sweet, you might want to add a squeeze of lemon at the end. Serve this with rice pilaf, polenta or warm flatbread for a festive meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/13/dining/09appetitechicken-a/merlin_176253234_85e9bc34-c0c8-4d14-b7d3-199ce2f7f2e6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken, honey, plum, red onion, sheet-pan, rosh hashana", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3536}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons fennel seeds", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest", "4 garlic cloves, finely grated", "2 teaspoons honey", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "Large pinch red-pepper flakes, or to taste", "1 chicken (about 3 1/2 pounds), cut into parts", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 cups ripe, soft plums, pitted and cut into 3/4-inch thick slices", "6 fresh thyme sprigs", "1 medium red onion, peeled and sliced from root to stem in 1/2-inch wedges", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "2/3 cup torn mint, basil or cilantro leaves (or a combination)", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toast the fennel seeds in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
