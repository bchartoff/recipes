Strain the pur\u00e9e through a sieve placed over a saucepan and lined with 3 layers of fine cheesecloth.

Peel the wax paper from it as you lay it directly over a salad. Work quickly -- the sauce melts rapidly and will stick to the wax paper unless frozen solid. Do not worry about breaks in the sheet.
