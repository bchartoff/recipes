In the American South, at least, everybody\u2019s grandmother had a recipe, and everyone knows just how it should be made. This is a base model with a few variations. It\u2019s nice to let it chill overnight before baking so the flavors meld. But you don\u2019t have to. The key is really good stock, though plenty of cooks over the years have made it with whatever was on hand \u2014 even water in a pinch. This is food for sustenance. But it pays to use the best ingredients possible. Be sure to leave enough time \u2014 the cornbread needs to sit out overnight to harden slightly before you make the dressing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/09/dining/09SUBCORNBREAD1/09SUBCORNBREAD1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "buttermilk, cornmeal, white bread, fall, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 163}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 379, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "672 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/56 grams butter", "2 cups/340 grams yellow cornmeal, fine grind (use the freshest, best quality you can find)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "2 eggs", "2 cups/473 milliliters buttermilk, preferably full fat", "3 cups soft white bread, crust removed and torn or cut into 1-inch pieces (do not pack)", "1/2 cup butter (1 stick), plus more for the pan", "2 cups chopped sweet onions", "1 1/2 cups chopped celery (4 or 5 stalks)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 eggs", "1 1/4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme", "3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "4 to 5 cups rich chicken or turkey stock, preferably homemade"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cornbread: Heat oven to 450 degrees.
