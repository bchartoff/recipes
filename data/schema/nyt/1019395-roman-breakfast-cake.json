{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roman Breakfast Cake", "description": "Of course this cake is good at lunch, at dinner, after school, afternoon or after midnight, but I call it a breakfast cake because it reminds me of a lemon cake I had with coffee every morning that I was in Rome. The cake is tall and golden, lightly lemony and most like a sponge cake \u2014 it\u2019s soft and stretchy: Pull it gently, and it will tug itself back into shape. If you have a tube pan, use it; if you don\u2019t, choose a Bundt pan with as few curves, crannies and crenellations as possible (fewer nooks make unmolding easier). When there are berries in the market, I fold them into the batter at the end. During the rest of the year, I go with straight lemon, although you could certainly make this cake with orange or a mix of citrus. Like so many of my favorite recipes, this is one that you can play with.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/08/magazine/08mag-OnDessert-image1/08mag-OnDessert-image1-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT3H5M", "recipeYield": "1 cake", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "egg, flour, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 615}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 581, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "388 milligrams", "sugarContent": "51 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter for greasing the pan", "1 1/2 cups (204 grams) all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "6 large eggs, separated and at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups (300 grams) sugar", "Finely grated zest of 2 lemons", "1/2 cup (120 milliliters) neutral oil, like canola", "Juice of 1 lemon (2 to 3 tablespoons)", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon pure lemon extract or oil (optional)", "About 1 1/2 cups (about 250 grams) blueberries, raspberries and/or blackberries (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to 350.
