This centuries-old dish has been around so long that traditional recipes call for large amounts of animal fat and honey, which were needed to preserve the meat before the invention of modern refrigeration. Mrouzia is usually served to celebrate Eid al-Adha (also known as Eid el-Kabir), or other special occasions. Enjoy with fluffy couscous or plenty of crusty bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nargisse Benkabbou"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/27/dining/nb-mrouzia-lamb-shanks/merlin_174968559_8322cc1f-0723-4075-9925-fc48f3d9c2cf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, soups and stews, tagine, main course", "keywords": "almond, cinnamon, garlic, honey, lamb, onion, raisins, ras el hanout, saffron, eid al-fitr, ramadan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 377}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "4 pounds lamb shanks (about 3 to 4 shanks), trimmed of excess fat", "1 large yellow onion, grated (about 2 cups)", "4 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed and finely chopped", "2 teaspoons ras el hanout", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Generous pinch of saffron threads", "2 cups vegetable stock, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup blanched almonds", "1 cup/150 grams dark raisins", "1/4 cup honey", "Couscous or crusty bread, to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Working in batches if needed, add the lamb shanks and cook until browned on each side, about 15 minutes.
