{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spumoni Ice Cream Cake", "description": "Spumoni is a frozen Italian-American dessert made by layering pistachio, cherry and chocolate (or sometimes vanilla) gelati. This showstopper ice cream cake version looks difficult, but it\u2019s made with store-bought ingredients, so it mostly involves shopping and assembly. The layers can be stacked ahead, and you also don\u2019t have to worry too much about its melting rapidly: The cake\u2019s sheer volume and store-bought ice creams' stabilizers help it stay cold. For a Neapolitan-style cake, you could swap strawberry ice cream for the cherry and vanilla for the pistachio. The only true challenge here is making sure there\u2019s room in your freezer, since this cake is about 4 inches tall.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/22/dining/as-spumoni-ice-cream-cake/merlin_158023122_3d451d2c-295a-4dfb-ab52-4e9bd158225f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H50M", "recipeYield": "About 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "cakes, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "amaretti cookies, confectioners' sugar, ice cream, maraschino cherry, sprinkles, whipping cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 199}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (1.5-quart) carton or 3 pints cherry ice cream", "1 (1.5-quart) carton or 3 pints pistachio ice cream", "1 (1.5-quart) carton or 3 pints chocolate ice cream, preferably with chocolate chips", "50 amaretti cookies, meringues or chocolate wafers (10 1/2 ounces)", "1 cup maraschino cherries (from one 14-ounce jar), drained and stemmed if needed", "2 1/2 cups heavy cream (see Tip)", "5 tablespoons confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Pinch of kosher salt", "Multicolored sprinkles, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the lid from the cherry ice cream and let sit at room temperature until the ice cream softens to the consistency of thick cake batter, 5 to 10 minutes.
