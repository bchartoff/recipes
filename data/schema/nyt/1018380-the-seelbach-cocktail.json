{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Seelbach Cocktail", "description": "When devising a signature drink for the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, Ky., Adam Seger drew inspiration from the cocktails made with cava and Spanish brandy that he had tasted at a Spanish restaurant. Wishing to create something that would resemble a pre-Prohibition drink, he replaced the brandy with Old Forester, a bourbon with a long heritage in Kentucky, and the cava with Korbel Brut, the sort of sparkling wine that would have been available to a Louisville bartender in the early years of the 20th century. The drink comes across as a mash-up of a manhattan and a Champagne cocktail: refreshing and just peculiar enough to keep you interested. Mr. Seger strongly recommends that all of the ingredients be very cold before being introduced to the glass.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/02/dining/02fake2/02fake2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bitters, bourbon, sparkling wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 49}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 263, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "8 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce bourbon, preferably Old Forester", "1/2 ounce triple sec", "7 dashes Angostura bitters", "7 dashes Peychaud\u2019s bitters", "5 ounces domestic sparkling wine, preferably Korbel Brut, chilled", "Orange twist, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing glass three-quarters filled with ice, combine the bourbon, triple sec and bitters.
