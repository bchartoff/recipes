{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Pretzel Pie", "description": "This is a wonderful but simple summer pie inspired by strawberry pretzel salad, a popular Southern dessert. The classic recipe consists of a crumbled pretzel crust, a whipped cream cheese and Cool Whip filling, and a top layer of strawberry Jell-O. In this fresher adaptation, crushed pretzels form the foundation of an easy shortbread crust, followed by a fluffy cream filling and a pile of fresh strawberries, omitting the use of gelatin. If you\u2019re making this pie in advance \u2014 especially with juicy, height-of-season berries \u2014 complete Steps 1 to 3, then cloak the filled crust with plastic wrap and chill up to 24 hours. Just before serving, toss the berries in sugar and pile them on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/jg-strawberry-pretzel-pie/merlin_156815769_95060ad1-0724-419f-a1dd-e8affd8d61ee-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, heavy cream, strawberries, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 221}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 tablespoons/200 grams unsalted butter (1\u00be sticks), softened, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 cups plus 2 tablespoons/265 grams unsifted confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3 cups/120 grams mini snack pretzels, finely ground", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "12 ounces/340 grams cream cheese", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters very cold heavy whipping cream", "1 pound/450 grams fresh strawberries, hulled and thinly sliced lengthwise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and grease the inside of a 9-inch, deep pie dish with butter and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or in a medium bowl using a handheld electric mixer, beat the 14 tablespoons butter, \u00bd cup confectioners\u2019 sugar, ground pretzels, flour, baking soda and salt on low speed until just combined, then increase the speed to high and continue to beat until you get a soft, cohesive dough.
