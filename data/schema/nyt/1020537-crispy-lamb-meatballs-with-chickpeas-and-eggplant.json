{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Lamb Meatballs With Chickpeas and Eggplant", "description": "This dish does not shy away from fat in the best way possible. From the lamb to the olive oil to the yogurt used as a sauce at the end, this is a one-skillet meal that feels worthy of a weekend spread. Since these meatballs aren\u2019t made with binders like eggs or bread, they\u2019re truly best made with a fatty meat like lamb. If you decide to use pork or beef instead, make sure it\u2019s a mixture with a higher fat content or the meatballs could turn out dry. Since eggplant can really soak up oil when pan-frying, feel free to add more to the skillet as the slices cook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/dining/21Romanrex/merlin_156252114_ab61c57b-64e1-4e8f-a0ab-94da3bbba996-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, meat, meatballs", "keywords": "chickpea, eggplant, greek yogurt, lamb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 447}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds ground lamb, pork or beef", "1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "8 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 medium eggplant, sliced about 1/4-inch thick", "2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1 cup full-fat Greek yogurt, labneh or sour cream", "3 cups mixed greens (the more peppery, the better)", "1 cup cilantro, leaves and tender\u00a0stems", "1 lemon, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine lamb, fennel seeds, garlic and 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes in a medium bowl.
