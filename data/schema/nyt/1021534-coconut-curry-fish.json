{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Curry Fish", "description": "Jamaican curry powder plays a major role in this deeply savory weeknight dish, giving the sauce its unique flavor and golden hue. The traditional spice blend is heavy on the turmeric, and benefits from being toasted, which brings out its notes. This recipe calls for frozen whiting, which doesn\u2019t hold up to frying but shines here, simmered in a sauce studded with red and green bell peppers. If whiting is unavailable, cod is also a good choice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/28/dining/mp-coconut-curry-fish-2/merlin_179685651_81c4975d-2fe8-4c53-a470-d5a617af7aec-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "curry powder, frozen fish, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1432}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 medium red bell peppers, deseeded and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick strips", "2 medium green bell peppers, deseeded and sliced into 1/4-inch-thick strips", "1 medium onion, sliced", "Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper", "1 1/2 tablespoons Jamaican curry powder (hot or mild)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "4 (6-ounce) fillets frozen fish, such as whiting or cod", "1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk", "1 lime", "2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced, for garnish", "Fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, for garnish", "White rice or couscous, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a medium (10-inch) saucepan with deep sides over medium-high.
