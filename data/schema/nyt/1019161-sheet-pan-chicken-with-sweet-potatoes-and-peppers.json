{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Sweet Potatoes and Peppers", "description": "This sheet-pan supper brings velvety sweet potatoes together with soft bell peppers, pungent sage and roasted chicken thighs. To counter the rich and caramelized flavors, quick-pickled thinly sliced red onion adds a bright and zippy note right at the end. If you prefer chicken breasts, you can use them here instead of the thighs. Choose bone-in, skin-on breasts if possible, and keep an eye on them. They\u2019ll cook faster than the thighs. Remove them when they\u2019re ready, but let the vegetables roast until they thoroughly golden and tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/08/dining/07Appetite1/merlin_133053119_c8f231db-0cee-420a-9c70-c497de6aa337-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, one pot", "keywords": "chicken thigh, honey, red bell pepper, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1515}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 605, "unsaturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "828 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons honey", "1 medium red onion, thinly sliced", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1 to 2 cloves garlic, grated or minced", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (4 to 6 thighs)", "2 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "12 ounces sweet potato (1 large), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 large red, yellow or orange bell pepper, thinly sliced", "1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage", "3/4 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne", "1/8 teaspoon ground allspice", "Cilantro leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small, shallow bowl, mix together vinegar and honey.
