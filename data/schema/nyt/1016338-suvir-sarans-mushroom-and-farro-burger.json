I\u2019ve struggled to find ways to hold my burgers together, and this solution was perfect. Try to find light-fleshed sweet potatoes; they are drier, and a little less sweet than orange yams. I also love all the textures in these hearty patties. I have made some changes to Suvir\u2019s recipe, roasting the potatoes rather than boiling them, and I use less oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/13/science/12recipehealth/12recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "10 patties", "recipeCuisine": "american, indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers", "keywords": "fall, summer, winter, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 92}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 300, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "367 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound pale-fleshed sweet potatoes or regular potatoes (such as Yukon gold), baked", "3/4 cup farro (see note)", "Salt to taste", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 fresh rosemary sprig", "1 fresh thyme sprig", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "3/4 cup finely chopped peanuts", "1 pound cremini mushroom caps, finely chopped", "3 shallots, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon dry white wine", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan", "1 cup panko or chickpea flour (you will not use all of it)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake potatoes in a 425-degree oven as directed.
