{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tsirani Vosp Apur (Armenian Apricot and Lentil Soup)", "description": "This soup is best made with fresh apricots, available at farmers\u2019 markets and grocery stores for a few precious weeks in the summer. But when fresh are not in season, Marina Sarukhanyan of Silk Apron Catering, who makes it year-round for her customers, suggests using bright-orange unsulfured apricots, not the dark ones. She usually gets hers from Iranian food stores, but you may be able to find them in Middle Eastern, Armenian or Russian shops as well. Make sure to drizzle the soup with tart pomegranate syrup, which contrasts with the apricots in a lovely way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/06/dining/01SOUPREX/merlin_208250952_4c39b88d-f43c-4a4e-8475-348430427c73-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings (about 7 1/2 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "apricot, carrot, lentils, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 146}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups roughly chopped fresh apricots (about 7 ounces, from 2 large or 4 small apricots), or 1 cup sugar-free, unsulfured dried apricots", "2 tablespoons avocado or vegetable oil", "1 small onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt", "1 medium tomato or 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, chopped", "5 to 6 cups vegetable broth", "2 cups red, orange or yellow split lentils, rinsed", "2 medium carrots, roughly chopped", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 lemon, juiced, plus more if desired", "Pomegranate syrup, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using dried apricots, at least 40 minutes before cooking, cut them into quarters, soak in warm water to cover, then drain and set aside.
