{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meatball Toad-in-the-Hole", "description": "This version of the British classic has meatballs instead of the traditional sausages, but feel free to revert to the original if you like. It is served with a rich onion gravy that is made in the oven, just like the main dish. The secret to a perfect toad-in-the-hole, in which the batter gets airy and crisp on the surface but remains soft and bready on the bottom, is making sure your oil is smoking hot when you pour in the batter, so be sure to heat up the oil well and then work quickly when adding the batter. This is best eaten immediately out of the oven, as it starts to deflate as it sits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/27/dining/27ottorex-2/27ottorex-2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, meat", "keywords": "eggs, ground pork, india pale ale, pancetta, rosemary, sourdough, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 301}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large eggs", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters India pale ale or another pale ale", "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour (plain flour), sifted", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons sunflower oil", "1 tablespoon/15 grams unsalted butter", "2 small onions (about 12 ounces/350 grams total), halved and thinly sliced", "2 rosemary sprigs", "3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (plain flour)", "2 cups/480 milliliters chicken stock", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/100 milliliters India pale ale", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "7 ounces/200 grams sourdough bread, crusts discarded and bread cut into 1/4-inch (1/2-centimeter) cubes", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters whole milk", "1 1/2 pounds/700 grams ground pork (pork mince)", "4 ounces/115 grams pancetta, very finely chopped", "1 very small onion (about 3 ounces/80 grams), grated", "1/3 packed cup/20 grams roughly chopped parsley", "4 garlic cloves, crushed", "1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 tablespoons/90 milliliters sunflower oil", "2 rosemary sprigs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit/240 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the batter: Add the eggs, milk, beer and mustard to a large bowl, and whisk vigorously until foamy, about 1 minute.
