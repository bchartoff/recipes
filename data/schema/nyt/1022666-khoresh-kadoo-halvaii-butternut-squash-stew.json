{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Khoresh Kadoo Halvaii (Butternut Squash Stew)", "description": "Khoresh kadoo halvaii is a popular and comforting fall dish from the northern region of Iran and is typically prepared with meat or chicken. This version swaps out the meat for canned chickpeas and is just as flavorful. Dried fruits are commonly used in Iranian cuisine to infuse a variety of savory dishes with a sweet and sour taste. Traditionally, dried golden sour prunes, aloo Bukhara, are added to this stew for a pleasing and distinct sour flavor, but pitted dark prunes, which lean a little sweeter, can be used. If using aloo Bukhara, be mindful of their pits when eating.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/19/dining/ND-butternut-squash-stew/merlin_196270077_ffae56fd-68e1-4b1a-a8b6-8e31b583fcdb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "butternut squash, chickpea, tomato, fall, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 401}, "recipeIngredient": ["A pinch of saffron threads (about 3/4 teaspoon)", "1 tablespoon plus a pinch of granulated sugar, more as needed", "1 pound precut butternut squash, cut into 1-inch cubes if needed", "1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "20 pitted prunes or dried golden sour prunes (aloo Bukhara), rinsed (see Tip)", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus more as needed", "Steamed rice, fresh herbs, scallions and plain yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
