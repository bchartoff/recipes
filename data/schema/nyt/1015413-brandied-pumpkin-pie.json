{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brandied Pumpkin Pie", "description": "Pumpkin pie made with canned pumpkin is all well and good, but pumpkin pie made with fresh butternut squash pur\u00e9e is even better. Thin-skinned and easy to cut, butternut squash turns soft and velvety if you roast it, and a quick whirl in the food processor or a blender quickly reduces to it to a luscious pur\u00e9e. Here we\u2019ve kept the seasonings on the light side to best showcase the character of the squash. But feel free to amp up the cinnamon and ginger if you like a spicier slice. The brandy is optional, and if you\u2019d rather not use it, you can leave it out (or substitute another spirit; bourbon is excellent). If you bake the pie a day ahead, keep it covered at room temperature until serving time \u2014 the refrigerator wreaks havoc on the crust.
