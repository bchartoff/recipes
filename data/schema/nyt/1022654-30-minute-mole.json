{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "30-Minute Mole", "description": "Several styles of mole \u2014 negro, colorado, verde and so many more \u2014 span different regions throughout Mexico, and the formulas vary from family to family. Mole is often viewed as intimidating, a sauce that requires toasting each ingredient individually, pounding them down to a paste and then cooking over low heat for hours to achieve layers of flavor. Although this recipe will never stand up to the mole an abuelita has been making for more than half her life, it will satiate the craving for homemade mole on a weeknight. Shortcuts like using roasted peanut butter and tahini help create this satisfying sauce in just 30 minutes. It\u2019s perfect for serving over just about anything: roasted mushrooms or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017792-roasted-cauliflower-steaks\">seared cauliflower</a>, jackfruit or tofu. It can even be tossed with cooked rice noodles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/14/dining/JR-30-minute-mole-with-cauliflower/merlin_195940515_5be1ed44-b514-4e5e-9eba-933ca05f0b35-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "guajillo chiles, peanut butter, tahini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 254}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups unsalted vegetable broth or water", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola", "3 dried pasilla chiles, stemmed and seeded", "4 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded", "1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "6 tablespoons unsalted roasted natural peanut butter or almond butter", "3 tablespoons tahini", "2 tablespoons turbinado or raw sugar", "2 tablespoons cacao or unsweetened cocoa powder", "1/4 cup dark chocolate chips or chunks", "1 tablespoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican", "1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 6-inch corn tortilla, toasted, or 1 tostada", "Salt and pepper", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017792-roasted-cauliflower-steaks\">Seared cauliflower</a> or other vegetables or proteins, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat broth in a small saucepan over medium-high until steaming; remove from heat.
