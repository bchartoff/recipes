{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate-Stuffed Oatmeal Cookies", "description": "These big, chewy oatmeal cookies filled with soft chocolate ganache are perfect for sharing. To make the process a little simpler, you can prep and refrigerate the dough and the filling up to three days in advance. (You could also freeze them for even longer; just let them warm up a bit at room temperature to make them easier to work with.) The assembly is easy: Simply enrobe the truffled filling by stacking it between two pieces of dough and pressing the edges to seal. The stuffed cookie balls can be frozen for up to a month. Bake off a few at a time for warm, gooey cookies whenever the mood strikes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/14/dining/ss-chocolate-filled-oatmeal-cookies/merlin_178579281_446eb888-c84f-44b4-bb31-b2e5bc515cc7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "12 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "butter, chocolate, dark brown sugar, oats, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 606}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "3/4 cup/165 grams dark brown sugar", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/150 grams quick-cooking or old-fashioned oats", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 tablespoons heavy cream", "3/4 cup/115 grams finely chopped semisweet or bittersweet chocolate", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "A generous pinch kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cookie dough: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the butter and both sugars and process until combined.
