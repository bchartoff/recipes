In an earlier version of this recipe, Owen recommended first roasting the ribs for 55 minutes in an oven set at 350 degrees. This way, when you finish them on the grill, they will be less likely to char and spoil the lacquered look. The choice is yours. David Myers noted that the ribs would also go well with the cucumber salad and preserved ginger from the salmon recipe that follows. But their best accompaniment is probably just a good cold beer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H35M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "main course, pork spareribs, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 45}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup honey", "1/2 cup soy sauce", "2 cloves garlic, crushed", "3 tablespoons ketchup", "4 pounds pork spareribs, cut into serving pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a pan large enough to fit the ribs, combine the honey, soy sauce, garlic, ketchup and 1/2 cup water.
