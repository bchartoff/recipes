{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggplant Baked With Tomatoes and Ricotta Salata", "description": "I have always loved eggplant parmigiana, but the first time I tried preparing it at home, I found the standard recipe daunting: too much frying and too much cheese. I've been simplifying it ever since. This recipe is more pared-down than most. I baked the eggplants with a simple tomato, eggplant and garlic topping bolstered with fragrant herbs. I used ricotta salata, but other cheeses, including shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano, fontina or mild pecorino, would be fine. Though the dish can be served hot from the oven, I prefer to let it cool somewhat, to let the flavors bloom. If made well in advance but not refrigerated, it can be reheated in a 300-degree oven for 20 minutes. And it makes for a handsome and delicious buffet dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/30/dining/30PAIR_WEB/30PAIR_WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "eggplant, ricotta salata, serrano ham, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 217}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 91, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "277 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3 medium-size eggplants, 9 to 10 ounces each", "Salt and ground black pepper", "2 ounces Serrano ham or prosciutto, finely diced", "3 large cloves garlic, minced", "1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves", "1 cup finely chopped fresh tomatoes", "1/2 teaspoon Espelette pepper or hot paprika, or to taste", "4 ounces ricotta salata, finely diced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
