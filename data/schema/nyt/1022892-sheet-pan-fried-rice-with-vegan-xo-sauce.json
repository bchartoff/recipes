{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Fried Rice With Vegan \u2018XO\u2019 Sauce", "description": "While making fried rice the traditional way isn\u2019t hard, this sheet-pan version is an excellent alternative method: It uses the oven for the heavy lifting and produces the perfect amount of crisping. Fried rice is the ultimate adaptable dish, and here, frozen mixed vegetables \u2014 that bag of corn, carrots, peas and beans that home cooks should always keep in the freezer \u2014 create a colorful canvas for an XO-inspired vegan mushroom sauce that infuses the dish with umami. The sauce is a wonderful condiment in itself, so make a double batch to keep in the fridge for slathering over noodles or roasted vegetables. You could use mushrooms other than cremini for the sauce; fresh or dried shiitake work incredibly well. Add more eggs if you wish, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/18/dining/hm-Sheet-Pan-Fried-Rice/merlin_199987314_29867925-c052-4558-81dd-edcc2a5dc11d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, grains and rice, main course", "keywords": "egg, mixed vegetables, mushroom, rice, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1506}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 heaping cups cold leftover rice (white or brown)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons sesame oil", "1 onion, finely diced", "1/2 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola, plus more for drizzling", "6 ounces cremini mushrooms, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon dark soy sauce", "3/4 to 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, to taste", "1 (16-ounce) bag frozen mixed vegetables (do not thaw)", "4 to 6 eggs", "2 scallions, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a sheet pan on the middle oven rack and heat to 450 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine the rice with salt, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, sesame oil and half of the diced onion.
