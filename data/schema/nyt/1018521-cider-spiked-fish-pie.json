{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cider-Spiked Fish Pie", "description": "This recipe for a smoky fish pie comes from the British food writer Ruby Tandoh. The filling is a simple mix of peas, cod and smoked haddock, gently poached in milk, thickened with roux and spiked with dry cider. Don't worry if the fish isn't completely cooked when you're putting together the pie; it will finish up in the oven, where it bubbles under a thick layer of mashed potato and grated cheese. The result is tender and luxuriously creamy comfort food.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/03/dining/04RUBYREX/04RUBY-1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pies and tarts", "keywords": "cheddar, cider, cod, haddock, peas, potato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 154}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 673, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "45 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1287 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 2/3 pounds/750 grams russet potatoes, peeled and quartered", "3 1/2 tablespoons/50 grams salted butter", "1/4 cup/50 milliliters whole milk", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "1 1/2 cups/350 milliliters whole milk", "9 ounces/250 grams cod fillet, cut into 2- to 3-inch pieces", "9 ounces/250 grams smoked haddock, cut into 2- to 3-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons/28 grams salted butter", "2 tablespoons flour", "2/3 cup/150 milliliters dry cider", "4 1/2 ounces/125 grams mild Cheddar, grated", "1 1/3 cups/150 grams frozen peas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the topping: Place potatoes in a pot of water and boil until tender, about 20 minutes.
