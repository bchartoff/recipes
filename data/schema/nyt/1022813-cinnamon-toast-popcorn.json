{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cinnamon Toast Popcorn", "description": "This snackable pile of lightly sweetened popcorn is reminiscent of buttery cinnamon toast and the perfect treat for two or four (or one!). You can easily make another batch to serve a crowd. Popcorn is coated in syrup and toasted in a pot to create a shell of caramelized sugar that\u2019s dusted with cinnamon. Five minutes out of the pot, the popcorn cools to a soft crispness, but if you bake it for just 10 minutes, the popped kernels dry all the way through and become crunchy to their core. This treat is delicious on its own or as part of a dessert board with gingerbread biscotti, iced oatmeal cookies or any other cookies of your choice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/15/dining/13BREAKFASTREX1/merlin_198975348_80874874-cc6b-4188-bd74-7173b8b91275-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, snack", "keywords": "christmas, new year\u2019s day, ground cinnamon, popcorn, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 263}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon light corn syrup", "1/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt", "4 1/2 cups/50 grams popped unbuttered, unsalted popcorn (see Tip)", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees and have a large sheet pan lined with parchment paper nearby."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, combine the sugar, butter, corn syrup, salt and 1 tablespoon water.
