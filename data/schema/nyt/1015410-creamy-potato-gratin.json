I parcook the potatoes in half-and-half before baking the gratin. It\u2019s easier to fine-tune the seasonings that way. And if there are leftovers, reheat them in the microwave and serve before the end of the weekend; this is not a dish that freezes well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/20/dining/20COOKING-AUGRATINPOTATOES/20COOKING-AUGRATINPOTATOES-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 172}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds Idaho potatoes, peeled", "3 cups half-and-half", "1 tablespoon soft butter", "3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs", "Salt", "Ground white pepper", "1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, preferably freshly ground"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
