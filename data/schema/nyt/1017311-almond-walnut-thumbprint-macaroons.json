{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Almond-Walnut Thumbprint Macaroons", "description": "These cookies are less sweet and chewier than many traditional nut macaroons. The recipe is from Eileen Dangoor Khalastchy, an 86-year-old cook and baker who remembers her mother making something similar when the family lived in Iraq. Ms. Khalastchy moved from Baghdad to London in the 1970s, but she remembers her mother making cookies like these and then sending them to be baked in the public oven because there was no oven at home then. Ms. Khalastchy has tinkered with the recipe, substituting walnuts for some of the almonds and adding an egg yolk to the traditional whites.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/25/dining/25MAC2/25REF3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H50M", "recipeYield": "About 3 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "blanched almonds, raspberry jam, rose water, walnut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 212}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 98, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "6 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/250 grams blanched almonds", "1 1/2 cups/125 grams walnuts", "1 scant cup/200 grams sugar", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 large egg", "2 egg whites", "1 cup of rose water, optional", "1/2 cup good quality raspberry jam, or 1/2 cup shelled pistachios"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the almonds in a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse until mostly powdered with a few crunchy bits remaining, about 15 pulses.
