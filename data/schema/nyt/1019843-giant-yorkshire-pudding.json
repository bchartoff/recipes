The recipe is simple, and relies upon just a few ingredients whisked together in a bowl then baked at a high temperature to achieve puffy, golden-brown perfection. (Yorkshire pudding also happens to serve as a perfect accompaniment to said roast.) If you don\u2019t have roast drippings, or run short on them, or are serving vegetarians, the recipe can also be prepared using butter instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/12/dining/em-giant-yorkshire-pudding/em-giant-yorkshire-pudding-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "butter, eggs, milk, fall, winter, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 204}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 384, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "457 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons/75 milliliters\u00a0roast drippings (or melted unsalted butter)", "5 large eggs", "2 1/4 cups/540 milliliters whole milk", "2 1/3 cups/300 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees with a rack\u00a0positioned in the lower third of the oven.\u00a0Brush a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with 3 tablespoons roast drippings to coat the base and sides."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, milk and the remaining 2 tablespoons roast drippings to combine.
