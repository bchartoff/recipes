It was all very convivial. But what really got my attention was something listed on the menu as Macedonian cheese pie. Imagine pizza-size calzone filled with feta.I made it not long after I returned from that trip. Later, I made it again, with the addition of some strips of sweet roasted peppers. It was even better, and hit its stride with some French sparkling wines that had modest effervescence, pleasant fruitiness and bright acidity.Next time, I might sprinkle chili flakes on the cheese, or smear some of that Balkan chili and pepper condiment, ajvar, on the dough before adding the cheese. No \u201cmight\u201d about it. I will use the ajvar next time.
