{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Reverse-Seared Steak", "description": "Reverse-searing is a grilling technique for steak that ensures a dark, sizzling crust and a rosy center that is perfectly cooked to your desired degree of doneness. This brilliant grilling method combines the low and slow cooking of traditional barbecue with the high heat charring practiced at steakhouses. Though it works well with any thick steak, from picanha to porterhouse, this recipe calls for a cut of steak popularized in Santa Maria, Calif., and is today known and loved across the U.S. as tri-tip. As the name suggests, it\u2019s a triangular or boomerang-shaped steak cut from the tip of the sirloin, blessed with a robust beefy flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/18/dining/14steakrex/18steakrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "father\u2019s day, labor day, memorial day, tailgate, tri-tip steak", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 422}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large or 2 small wood chunks (such as oak, hickory or mesquite) or 1 1/2 cups wood chips", "Canola oil, for greasing the grill grate", "1 tri-tip steak (about 2 to 2 1/4 pounds; see Tip)", "Coarse kosher or sea salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Granulated onion or garlic (or both)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using wood chips, soak in water for 30 minutes. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/14/dining/how-to-reverse-sear-steak.html\">Set up your grill for indirect grilling</a> and heat to 250 degrees.
