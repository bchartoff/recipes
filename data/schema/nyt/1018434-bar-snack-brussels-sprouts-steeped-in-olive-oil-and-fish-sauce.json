At Prune, in New York, we started with a pound of brussels sprouts for dinner but ate them all while still prepping in the kitchen and then increased to two pounds and ate those as well, before we even sat down. Now we make them to be eaten standing up on purpose. Set out on the bar for parties, where you\u2019d expect to find olives; they never last there either.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/27/magazine/27feast-recipe1-brussel-sprouts/27feast-recipe1-brussel-sprouts-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, fish sauce, olive oil, salt, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 363}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "Brussels sprouts, trimmed at stalk end", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Vietnamese fish sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and season with coarse kosher salt until as salty as the sea.
