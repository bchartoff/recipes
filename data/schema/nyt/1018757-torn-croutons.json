To begin with, your raw ingredients are almost certainly of a higher quality, and hence more delicious, than the stuff anyone else will use. What\u2019s more, the rustic, uneven shape of torn croutons, like these croutons from \"Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat\" by Samin Nosrat, lends a variety of textures to your salads. Dressing clings to them better, they\u2019re more lovely to look at, and they are less likely to scratch the roof of your mouth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/09/dining/09SALADGUIDE15/09SALADGUIDE15-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "country bread, sourdough", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 234, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "342 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1-pound loaf day-old country or sourdough bread", "1\u20443 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
