Pressure cookers have a special way with dried beans, cooking even unsoaked beans quickly and evenly, so that the beans become creamy but retain their shape. Here, you want the beans to be very soft, so that the stew is thick, not brothy. \u201cMonday red beans\u201d are traditionally flavored with a leftover pork bone, so you can use one instead of a ham hock, if you like. If you have a favorite Cajun or Creole seasoning blend, use 1 heaping tablespoon of it in place of the sage, cayenne, garlic, onion and paprika, and taste before adding any salt, since seasoning blends vary in salinity.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/22/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-red-beans-and-rice/merlin_167526705_ab34b4c5-b8b1-4008-bf6d-5f4b807bcc8e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, sausages", "keywords": "andouille sausage, bell pepper, celery, garlic, ham hock, kidney bean, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 28}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 celery stalks, finely chopped", "1 green bell pepper, finely chopped", "10 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cayenne, to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground sage (optional)", "1 pound dried red kidney beans (no need to soak)", "12 ounces smoked pork sausage, preferably Andouille, sliced into 1-inch-thick coins", "1 smoked ham hock (about 10 ounces)", "3 dried bay leaves", "3 fresh thyme sprigs or 1 teaspoon dried thyme", "Cooked rice, for serving", "Sliced scallions, for serving", "Louisiana-style hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn on the saut\u00e9 setting of a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker and heat the oil.
