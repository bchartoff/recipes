{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mezcal Corpse Reviver", "description": "Charles Cerankosky, a Rochester bar owner, has fielded plenty of creative orders in his day. One of the most unusual requests was to use mezcal instead of gin in a Corpse Reviver, a sour that dates back a century. This twist is not a natural fit, so Mr. Cerankosky replaced the usual lemon juice with a mix of lime and grapefruit juice to better complement the mezcal. With all that\u2019s going on in this drink, the mezcal almost gets lost, if that\u2019s possible. Still, its smokiness lingers in the back, and the panoply of flavors is intriguing enough to lure you back for another sip.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/11mezcalrex2/11mezcalrex2-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 12}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce Cocchi Americano", "3/4 ounce mezcal, preferably El Buho", "3/4 ounce Cura\u00e7ao, preferably Pierre Ferrand Dry\u00a0", "1/4 ounce lime juice", "1/2 ounce grapefruit juice", "1 bar spoon absinthe for rinse, preferably St. George Absinthe Verte"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice, combine mezcal, Cocchi Americano, Cura\u00e7ao and the 2 juices.
