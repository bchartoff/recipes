{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Parmesan White Bean Soup With Hearty Greens", "description": "Whatever you do, don\u2019t throw away your Parmesan rinds: Within those waxy rinds is enough rich umami and salty cheese flavor to carry an entire soup\u2019s broth. Collect and store them in an airtight container in the freezer (or purchase a container of them at your grocery store). Once you have about 10 ounces of rinds, simmer them with aromatics as you would to make chicken or bone broth. (For an easier cleanup, enclose the rinds in cheesecloth or muslin.) Use the broth to make risotto or minestrone, a pot of beans or this soup, which combines beans and greens with the garlic and lemon rind from the broth. Use whichever beans and greens you like, and mop up every last Parmesan-y drop with a hunk of crusty bread.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/dining/as-parmesan-white-bean-soup/as-parmesan-white-bean-soup-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "garlic, lemon, olive oil, parmesan, thyme, white beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1134}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 head garlic, halved crosswise", "10 ounces Parmesan rinds, enclosed in cheesecloth or muslin", "1 lemon, rind peeled into thick strips with a vegetable peeler, then halved and juiced", "8 sprigs fresh thyme", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 pound hearty greens (such as escarole, kale, mustard greens or rapini), stemmed and torn into bite-size pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 (15-ounce) cans white beans (such as Great Northern or cannellini) or chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the Parmesan broth: In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high.
