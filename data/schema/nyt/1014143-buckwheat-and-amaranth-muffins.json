But muffins don\u2019t have to be cloying \u2014 a bit of natural sweetener is all that\u2019s required to make them taste like a treat. And they don\u2019t have to be calorie-laden confections. This week, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s possible to make muffins with a number of nutritious ingredients, particularly whole grains. Muffins made with buckwheat or cornmeal offer great taste and nourishment \u2014 without the feeling that you\u2019re chewing on rocks. Even if you don\u2019t think of yourself as a baker, take a stab at this week\u2019s recipes. They\u2019re easy and come together quickly. Of all the muffins I make, these have the most distinctive flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/02/science/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, healthy", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 68}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 224, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "236 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup whole-wheat flour", "3/4 cup buckwheat flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 cup amaranth flour (you can make this by blending the amaranth in a spice mill; it does not have to be finely ground)", "2 eggs", "1/3 cup honey", "1 1/2 cups buttermilk", "1/3 cup canola oil", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup blackberries tossed with 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees with the rack moved to the upper third of the oven.
