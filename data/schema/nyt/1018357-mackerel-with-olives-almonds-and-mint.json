{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mackerel With Olives, Almonds and Mint", "description": "Unlike other types of mackerel, which can have a strong flavor, Spanish mackerel is very mild and quite tender. It\u2019s a bit like salmon in that it\u2019s meaty and easy to cook. Here, the fish is roasted in the oven while a buttery, wine pan sauce speckled with olives and toasted sliced almonds is whisked together on top of the stove. Fresh mint adds color and brightness, but use any herbs you like. Basil and parsley are great substitutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/26/dining/26APPE1/26APPE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, seafood", "keywords": "main course, olives, sliced almonds, Spanish mackerel, white wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 65}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 543, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "735 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 Spanish mackerel fillets, 6 to 8 ounces each", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Half a lime", "Fine sea salt", "1/4 cup sliced almonds", "1 cup dry white wine", "5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced", "2/3 cup sliced, pitted olives (any good kind is fine)", "3 tablespoons chopped mint leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
