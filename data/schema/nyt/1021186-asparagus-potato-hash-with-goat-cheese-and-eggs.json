Just make sure everything is diced into 1/2-inch pieces so the vegetables cook evenly and quickly. Serve as part of an elegant brunch spread, with toast for a hearty (and vegetarian!) weekend breakfast, or eat it straight from the skillet with a glass of white wine as a quick, clean-out-the-fridge dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/17/dining/lh-veggie-hash/merlin_173545866_9d3717f2-70fc-429c-8f6d-272552dd70d6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, weekday, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, eggs, fennel, leek, lemon, potato, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 515}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 1/4 pounds Yukon Gold or red new potatoes, scrubbed and diced into 1/2-inch pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 large fennel bulb, diced into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 cup), fennel fronds reserved", "1 leek, trimmed, halved lengthwise and sliced 1/4-inch thick (about 1 cup chopped leeks)", "1/2 pound asparagus (10 to 12 spears), trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus lemon zest and more juice for serving (optional)", "4 large eggs", "3 tablespoons crumbled plain goat cheese", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, mint or parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
