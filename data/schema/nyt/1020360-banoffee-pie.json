{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banoffee Pie", "description": "With generous layers of dulce de leche, bananas and whipped cream, this dazzling pie is not for the faint of heart. The banoffee or banoffi pie, a mash-up of banana and toffee, was created in 1971 by the chef Ian Dowding and Nigel MacKenzie, the owner of the Hungry Monk, a now-closed restaurant in Sussex, England. The original recipe called for a traditional pie crust, homemade dulce de leche and coffee-flavored whipped cream, but we\u2019ve simplified it for the home cook by using a graham cracker crust, store-bought dulce de leche and plain whipped cream. If you like, you could add a teaspoon of instant coffee granules to the whipped cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/18/dining/ml-banoffee-pie/ml-banoffee-pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "banana, dulce de leche, graham cracker crumbs, instant coffee, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 406}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/155 grams graham cracker crumbs (about 10 whole graham crackers)", "5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 1/2 cups/600 milliliters store-bought dulce de leche (about 20 ounces)", "3 large bananas, peeled and sliced about 1/4-inch thick", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters cold heavy cream", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon instant coffee granules (optional)", "Chocolate shavings or fresh coffee grounds, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
