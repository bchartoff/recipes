{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Spaghetti and Meatballs", "description": "Using a mixture of uncased sausage and ground beef is the trick to achieving tender, flavorful meatballs without a lot of work or extra ingredients. These three-inch meatballs are oversize, so they can stay moist and tender after cooking for an extended period. This way, they also fit in the slow cooker in one layer, which helps them cook evenly. Choose any kind of turkey sausage you like best; sweet or hot Italian are both great choices. (Pork will work too, but will make the sauce a little oily.) Fear not, the spaghetti is cooked separately, so you can serve these meatballs over any long noodle for a traditional take, or spoon them over polenta or tuck them into hero rolls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/30/dining/slow-cooker-meatballs/slow-cooker-meatballs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "5 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, pastas", "keywords": "basil, bread crumbs, garlic, onion, parmesan, parsley, red wine, sausage, spaghetti, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 163}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup tomato paste", "3 tablespoons dry red wine", "1 cup panko bread crumbs", "1 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley (about 1/2 bunch)", "4 ounces grated Parmesan (1 to 1 1/4 cups), plus more for serving", "1/2 medium onion, coarsely grated (about 1/3 cup)", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "2 tablespoons whole milk", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 teaspoons red wine vinegar", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound bulk fresh sweet or hot Italian turkey sausage", "1 pound ground beef (10 to 20 percent fat)", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "2 sprigs fresh basil, plus more for serving", "1 pound dried spaghetti, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, whisk together the tomato paste and red wine.
