The quality of phyllo dough varies hugely from one brand to another. It\u2019s particularly important here to get a good-quality phyllo as there is so much of it. This is a sort of quiche with a twist, with the phyllo both acting as a casing and adding the extra crispness you get from blind baking. It\u2019s a meal in itself, served with a simple salad. If you don\u2019t have a tart pan handy, use a 9-inch cake pan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/10/dining/10BAKING1/10BAKING1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, pies and tarts", "keywords": "feta, mint, parsley, pecorino romano, phyllo, tarragon, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 174}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 290, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "358 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 sheets of thin 16-by-12-inch/40-by-30-centimeter phyllo pastry (about 200 grams)", "3 tablespoons/45 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1 scant cup/100 grams finely crumbled feta (3 1/2 ounces/100 grams)", "2 lightly packed cups/50 grams finely grated pecorino Romano (1 1/2 ounces/45 grams)", "2 tablespoons/5 grams roughly chopped parsley", "2 tablespoons/5 grams roughly chopped tarragon leaves", "2 tablespoons/5 grams roughly chopped mint leaves", "4 eggs", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters heavy cream (double cream)", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "Salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit/200 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brush one of the phyllo sheets lightly with melted butter and place, butter side-up, in a 9-inch/25-centimeter round tart pan.
