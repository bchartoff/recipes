{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Sugar-Cured Salmon", "description": "This grilled and smoked salmon recipe by the food writer Betty Fussell calls for curing the fish for several hours with salt, brown sugar and spices before smoking it over indirect heat on your grill. While the fatty fish absorbs the smoke beautifully, the fish can also be successfully cooked in a grill pan, or under the broiler. The salt and sugar cure, laced with sweet spices, both flavors the fish and firms up its flesh, giving it a meaty, silky texture. Serve it with a crisp salad for a light supper, or with rice for something more substantial.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/30/multimedia/clark-salmon-fussell/clark-salmon-fussell-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "brown sugar, hickory chips, salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 374}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 skin-on, center-cut wild king or other salmon fillets (2 1/2 pounds total)", "1/4 cup light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/4 teaspoon ground mace", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon, plus lemon wedges for serving", "Olive oil", "1 1/2 cups hickory chips, soaked for 30 minutes and drained"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat fish dry with paper towels.
