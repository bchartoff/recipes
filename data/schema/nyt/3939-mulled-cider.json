{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mulled Cider", "description": "This is a recipe for a hot beverage we enjoy on cold winter evenings. When curled up with a good book in front of a blazing fire, nothing tastes better than cider.\n\nPreferably, it is made with cloudy, unfiltered sweet cider, the fresh juice of pressed apples, which I combine with cloves, allspice berries and cinnamon sticks. After being steeped together like tea, the cloves and allspice come to the top and can be removed before serving, and the stick of cinnamon, which sinks to the bottom, can be served with the liquid. Add bourbon or rum if you wish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jacques Pepin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/12/dining/12COOKING-CIDER1/12COOKING-CIDER1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "cider, spices, dairy-free, gluten-free, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 170}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 127, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "14 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 quarts unfiltered sweet cider", "12 allspice berries", "12 whole cloves", "2 sticks cinnamon, broken into pieces", "6 tablespoons bourbon (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all ingredients but the bourbon in a saucepan and heat over medium heat until the mixture is just below a boil.
