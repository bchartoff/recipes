{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brisket With Horseradish Gremolata", "description": "This tender, deeply flavored brisket gets its character from two distinct sources. Searing the meat until dark brown gives the sauce a caramelized, intensely brawny taste, while a bracing garnish of fresh horseradish gremolata spiked with parsley and lemon zest adds brightness and a sinus-clearing bite. Make the meat a few days ahead, it only gets better as it rests. But to get the most out of the gremolata, don\u2019t grate the horseradish until an hour or two before serving. If you can\u2019t find fresh horseradish, use 4 cloves minced garlic instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/18/multimedia/clark-brisket/clark-brisket-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "brisket, horseradish, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 625}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 648, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "730 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (4- to 5-pound) brisket, preferably second cut", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper", "4 garlic cloves, chopped", "6 sprigs fresh thyme", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large onions, thinly sliced", "2 large carrots, sliced into thin rounds", "2 large celery stalks, diced", "1 1/2 cups dry red wine", "2 whole bay leaves", "1 1/2 cups parsley, coarsely chopped", "Grated zest of 1 small lemon", "3 tablespoons fresh, coarsely grated horseradish", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season brisket all over with salt and pepper.
