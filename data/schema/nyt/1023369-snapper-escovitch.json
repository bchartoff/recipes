{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Snapper Escovitch", "description": "A Caribbean favorite, this light, tender and flaky fish is made with whole snapper, but you can also use fillets for ease. This recipe has a mellow spice to let the flavor of the fish shine through, but it\u2019s open to adaptation: Feel free to add a little more hot pepper or allspice, if you like, for more intensity. If you\u2019re in a hurry or low on spices, you can substitute Old Bay, jerk or Cajun seasoning blends for the spice mix in Step 1. Then, turn it into a sandwich (see Tip), paired with sweet plantain fries, or eat it as a light meal on its own.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/27/dining/mp-snapper-escovitch/mp-snapper-escovitch-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, fish, dairy-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 122}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 cup vegetable oil, plus more as needed", "4 (6-ounce) skin-on snapper fillets or 2 pounds whole red snapper\u00a0", "1 dry bay leaf", "1/2 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated", "3 small bell peppers (red, yellow, green or one of each), thinly sliced", "1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced", "1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into matchsticks", "1 Scotch bonnet chile, pierced", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce", "1 teaspoon allspice berries or pickling spice\u00a0", "4 garlic cloves, minced\u00a0", "3/4 cup red wine vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix together 1 teaspoon thyme leaves, garlic powder, ginger, salt and pepper.
