{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sinasir (Fermented Rice Skillet Cakes)", "description": "A flat skillet cake made from a batter of fermented rice, sinasir is a recipe from Northern Nigeria similar in texture to Somali cambaabur and Ethiopian injera. Its spongy texture makes it an excellent vehicle for sopping up soups, stews or chunks of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020289-beef-suya\">beef suya</a>. It is also quite lovely when eaten as a snack, drizzled lightly with honey. This version gets a bit of nuttiness from the short-grain brown rice, and the scent of toasted rice will waft through your kitchen as you cook. The fermentation step in the beginning is crucial, as it gives the finished cakes a slight sourness. For a more intense tang, ferment slowly in the refrigerator using the directions below.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/24/dining/19komolaferex-sinasir/merlin_211376400_bf55371e-5ef7-4837-9b55-6f399196d32b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT6H", "recipeYield": "10 cakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, pancakes, side dish", "keywords": "brown rice, instant yeast, nigerian, plan-ahead, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 77}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups short-grain brown rice", "2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon instant yeast", "Neutral oil, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place rice in a medium bowl and cover with 2 inches of water.
