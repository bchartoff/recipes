{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Eggplant Salad", "description": "Here is a deeply flavored salad that can be prepared entirely outdoors, keeping the heat out of the kitchen. Grill a whole fat purple globe eggplant until the skin blisters. Then scrape the soft insides into a bowl and season them with red wine vinegar, garlic, good olive oil and fresh herbs. A few capers on top add a pleasing brininess. Serve it with pita bread, a good ros\u00e9 and a hunk of feta, and want for nothing more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/Grilled-Eggplant-Salad/Grilled-Eggplant-Salad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "about 1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "eggplant, pita, tomato, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 821}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 141, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "242 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large eggplant", "1 plum tomato, diced", "1 1/2 teaspoons red wine vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley", "Black pepper, to taste", "Capers, for garnish, optional", "Grilled pita bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat grill to medium high.
