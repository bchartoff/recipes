{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Sea Scallops With Spicy Carrot Coulis", "description": "A coulis, pronounced koo-LEE, is a thin, pourable sauce, often made from tomatoes for savory dishes, or from berries for desserts. This brilliant orange sauce gets a splash of vinegar for a hit of acidity and a pinch of cayenne for heat, a perfect foil for the scallops\u2019 sweetness. For the best flavor, use young bunch carrots, not large \u201chorse carrots.\u201d This is a very easy dish if the sauce is prepared in advance. (Make the sauce up to a day ahead. If made in advance, reheat to serve.) Then it\u2019s just a matter of searing the scallops and assembling the plates.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/10/dining/05Tanisrex2-scallops/merlin_183069669_e92ec313-9ac9-4c4b-a94e-2d423f4ddf76-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "carrot, chives, cilantro, garlic, scallops, valentine\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 573}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups sliced young carrots", "6 large garlic cloves, peeled", "1 cup chopped sweet onion", "2 tablespoons white wine vinegar or sherry vinegar", "Generous pinch of ground cayenne", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon honey or granulated sugar", "2 cups chicken broth, light vegetable stock or water", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "18 large dry-packed sea scallops, cleaned and patted dry (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup roughly chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems (from 1 small bunch)", "2 tablespoons finely cut chives or green scallion tops", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced Fresno, serrano or jalape\u00f1o chiles", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the coulis: Put carrots, garlic, onion, vinegar, cayenne, salt, honey and broth in a saucepan over high heat.
