One of the reasons: I used wheat germ, which browns more quickly than oats. Now I keep the heat low in my oven and line my backing sheets with parchment. Be sure to stir the granola every 10 to 15 minutes, and switch the trays from top to bottom each time you stir. If you want to make a smaller amount, you can halve this recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/12/07/health/07recipehealth_600/07recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Makes about 2 1/2 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, weekday, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "healthy, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 57}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 394, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "6 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups flaked or rolled oats", "2 cups oat bran", "1/2 cup flax seeds, coarsely ground", "1/2 cup coconut, flaked or shaved optional", "1 cup chopped nuts (I recommend almonds and pecans)", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (to taste)", "2 to 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon (to taste)", "1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon salt (optional)", "1/3 cup canola oil", "1/2 cup mild honey, such as clover", "1 tablespoon vanilla", "1 to 2 cups raisins (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
