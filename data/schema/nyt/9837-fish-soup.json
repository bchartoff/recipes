Cook the fish at a slow simmer until the flesh flakes easily. (Boneless fillets will cook very quickly, in two or three minutes, depending on the thickness. A whole fish may take as much as 25 to 30 minutes.) Remove the fish when done and, if using a whole fish or fish steaks, discard skin and bones. Set the flesh aside in a bowl, drizzling one or two tablespoons of oil over the top to keep it from drying out."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the potato cubes to the stock and cook for 10 minutes or so, or until the potato pieces are tender.
