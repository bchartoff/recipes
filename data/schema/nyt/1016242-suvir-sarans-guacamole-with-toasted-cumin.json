{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Suvir Saran\u2019s Guacamole With Toasted Cumin", "description": "The chef Suvir Saran says that \u201cavocados make people happy,\u201d and he\u2019s right.  He adds toasted cumin seeds, which he refers to as \u201cIndian bacon bits,\u201d to his chunky guacamole. This guacamole has all the flavors of a Mexican guacamole \u2013 illustrating yet again how Indian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Mexican cuisines overlap. In fact, the ingredients here are identical to those that I have always used in my guacamole; but this recipe  has the added delight of texture, as the ingredients aren\u2019t mashed up. This is best served sooner than later as the avocado color will fade, but it has a few hours of holding power.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "indian, mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 49}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 230, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "169 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ripe Hass avocados, halved and pitted", "1 small tomato, chopped", "1 small red onion, finely diced", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "1 jalape\u00f1o, minced (seeded for a milder flavor)", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon toasted cumin seeds, ground if desired", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground peppercorns", "Juice of 2 limes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut avocados into small dice.
