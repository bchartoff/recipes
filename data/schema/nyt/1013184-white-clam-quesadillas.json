{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White-Clam Quesadillas", "description": "I love beer with seafood, especially casual summer seafood like lobster rolls, fried clams and steamers. A good white-clam pizza also calls for a refreshing pale ale.\n\nUsing the pizza as my inspiration, I made clam quesadillas that I seared on the grill. While they were still sizzling hot, with the mellow cheese starting to ooze, I cut them into wedges, which disappeared almost as fast as the frosty mugs of beer.\n\nWith a small portable grill, you can prepare them to cook at the beach or in the park. And if the weather does not cooperate, sear them on a griddle or under the broiler.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/white-clam-quesadillas/white-clam-quesadillas-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "appetizer, cheese, clams", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 16}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 460, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1203 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces smoked bacon, finely diced", "4 garlic cloves, slivered", "1 large jalape\u00f1o, cored, seeded and slivered", "2 scallions, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "12 cherrystone clams, opened, drained and coarsely chopped", "4 large flour tortillas", "4 ounces young Asiago cheese, shaved with vegetable peeler", "1 tablespoon chopped cilantro", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Light a grill, preferably a charcoal one.
