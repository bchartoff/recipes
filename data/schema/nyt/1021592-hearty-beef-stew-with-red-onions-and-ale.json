{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hearty Beef Stew With Red Onions and Ale", "description": "In this cozy beef stew, tender chunks of meat in a silky, savory, ale-tinged sauce share the pot with wedges of red onion and sweet nuggets of carrot. A little coriander and allspice add fragrance and depth to the mix, while a spoonful of tomato paste deepens and rounds out the flavors. Like all stews, it tastes even better a day or two later, and can be frozen for up to two months. Serve it over something soft and buttery to soak up the sauce: a mound of mashed potatoes, noodles or polenta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/04/dining/04apperex/merlin_178770741_300da621-a32e-4894-adc7-4ae660af6d3c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "ale, allspice, beef, carrot, coriander, garlic, stock, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2055}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds boneless beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch chunks", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 medium red onions", "1 to 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more as needed", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice", "2 cups beef or chicken stock, preferably homemade", "1 cup ale or beer (nonalcoholic is fine)", "1 rosemary sprig", "3 carrots, sliced", "1 tablespoon cider vinegar or sherry vinegar, plus more to taste", "Chopped chives, for garnish", "Flaky sea salt, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the beef all over with salt and pepper.
