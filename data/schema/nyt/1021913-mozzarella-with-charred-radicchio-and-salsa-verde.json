{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mozzarella With Charred Radicchio and Salsa Verde", "description": "A simple, pleasurable contrast: Sweet, milky mozzarella is paired here with slightly bitter radicchio, blackened and smoky from high heat. Coating both is a salsa verde made with extra-virgin olive oil, green herbs and a touch of caper and lemon. You want really good mozzarella, and it must not be served straight from the refrigerator. Allow it to come to cool room temperature, and it will taste a thousand times better (this is true of most cheeses, by the way).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/03/dining/26Tanisrex1-antipasto/26Tanisrex1-antipasto-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer", "keywords": "capers, cilantro, lemon, mozzarella, parsley, radicchio, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 229}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 radicchio heads, outer leaves removed", "3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, leaves and tender stems", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems", "2 tablespoons finely cut chives or scallion tops", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped capers", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)", "1/2 teaspoon sumac (optional)", "1 pound fresh mozzarella, at cool room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 475 degrees.
