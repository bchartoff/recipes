{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Wheat Soda Bread With Raisins (Spotted Dog)", "description": "Traditional spotted dog is made with white flour and does not always include an egg. I\u2019ve always preferred brown soda bread made with a mix of whole-wheat and white flour, with more whole wheat than white. For this version, rather than traditional currants or sultanas I used a delicious mix of large golden, flame and jumbo raisins. As always with soda bread, the trick to success is to handle it as little as possible.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/18/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 large loaf (about 16 slices)", "recipeCuisine": "irish", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, quick", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 146}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 136, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "168 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["310 grams (approximately 2 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon) whole-wheat flour", "125 grams (approximately 1 cup) unbleached all-purpose or bread flour", "7 grams (scant 1 1/2 teaspoons) baking soda, sifted", "7 grams (1 teaspoon) salt", "8 grams (2 teaspoons, packed) brown sugar", "125 grams (3/4 cup, tightly packed) raisins, any variety or a mix (more to taste)", "1 egg", "About 356 grams (1 1/2 cups) buttermilk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
