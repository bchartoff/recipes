{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Tamarind Pork Ribs With Scallions and Peanuts", "description": "This recipe balances richness with a tart sweetness, and features a two-part approach to cooking the meat that yields complex flavor</span>. Pork spare ribs are marinated, covered and baked until just tender. They\u2019re then brushed with a glaze made with an invigorating combination of tamarind, ginger, nutmeg and scotch bonnet chile. You can finish the ribs in a hot oven or on the grill; the glaze caramelizes nicely either way. They are delightful as a finger food or as a main dish with practically any accompaniment, like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021278-spicy-cucumbers-with-yogurt-lemon-and-herbs\">this cool cucumber salad</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/29/dining/yk-tamarind-pork-ribs/yk-tamarind-pork-ribs-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, finger foods, meat, main course", "keywords": "baby back ribs, brown sugar, ginger, peanut, ribs, scallion, tamarind", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 320}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 racks baby back or spare ribs (about 2 1/2 pounds each)", "1 cup dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons garlic powder", "1 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 cup store-bought tamarind concentrate or pur\u00e9e", "1 scotch bonnet chile, stemmed and chopped, or 2 tablespoons sambal oelek or other chile paste", "2 tablespoons honey", "2 tablespoons grated ginger", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1 tablespoon lime zest (from about 2 limes)", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions", "1/4 cup peanuts, crushed (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 300 degrees.
