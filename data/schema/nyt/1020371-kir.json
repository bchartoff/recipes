{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kir", "description": "A classic kir is made with aligot\u00e9 wine and cr\u00e8me de cassis (black currant liqueur), both of which come from the Burgundy region of France. Once you have the classic down (a glass of white wine with just a hint of cassis), variations abound. Substitute sparkling wine for the aligot\u00e9, and it becomes a kir royale. Add red wine, and it\u2019s a Bourgogne. If you\u2019re over wine entirely, dry hard cider (and a splash of Calvados, if you\u2019re feeling extra) turns the drink into a kir Normand, its name nodding to Normandy. Whatever base you choose, kirs easily veer saccharine when weighed down with a hefty pour of cr\u00e8me de cassis. Exercise restraint with the potent liqueur \u2014 aim for a more dusty rose hue than magenta \u2014 but feel free to drink in rapid succession.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/26/dining/26Kirrex1/merlin_158456814_1efd6763-3665-4ce6-a77c-d9c653f5ff85-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "creme de cassis, white wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "recipeIngredient": ["Scant 1/2 ounce cr\u00e8me de cassis", "5 to 6 ounces dry white wine, chilled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a wine glass, combine the cassis and wine.
