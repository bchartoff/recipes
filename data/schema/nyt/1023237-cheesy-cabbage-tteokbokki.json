Sometimes the sauce is soy-sauce-based, as the kings of the Joseon dynasty enjoyed in the royal court dish <a href=\"\nhttps://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022114-gungjung-tteokbokki-korean-royal-court-rice-cakes\">gungjung tteokbokki</a>. But more commonly today, as it is here, the sauce is gloriously red, spicy and gochujang-based. Traditional versions might include fish cakes and whole hard-boiled eggs, but this one leans into a base of butter-fried shallots and a layer of melted cheese covered in a crunchy blanket of raw cabbage. A parade of halved, molten-centered soft-boiled eggs bedecks the top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/15ESSENTIALSrex6/merlin_207587184_e8668dfd-fede-459b-98df-6ce726b92e44-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, grains and rice, side dish", "keywords": "cabbage, gochujang, tteok (korean rice cakes), vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 252}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large eggs", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons gochujang", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 large shallots, thinly sliced crosswise into rings", "Salt", "1 pound fresh or frozen tteok (rice cakes)", "1/2 cup shredded cheese, such as sharp Cheddar or low-moisture mozzarella", "5 ounces green cabbage, shredded (about 2 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a small pot of water to a boil over high heat.
