{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Rice Bowl With Bok Choy and Mushrooms", "description": "A bowl of rice with vegetables makes a healthy and delicious meal, especially if the rice is whole grain. Whole-grain rice comes in many colors, from golden amber to rusty red to purplish black. This recipe calls for Thai black sticky rice (also called sweet or glutinous rice), which is pleasantly chewy. In Thailand, black sticky rice is most often used to make sweet rice pudding with coconut milk, but it tastes very good in combination with savory ingredients. If sticky rice is not your thing, you could use Chinese black \u201cforbidden rice,\u201d or any other whole-grain rice. With stir-fried greens and shiitake mushrooms, this visually stunning dish is full of goodness, kissed with ginger, garlic and sesame.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/dining/19kitchrex/merlin_153211740_4baf2274-e0f5-4c1a-bbd3-d18323ec9a47-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, grains and rice", "keywords": "black rice, bok choy, chiles de \u00e1rbol, shiitake, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 188}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 105, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "644 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups black glutinous (sticky) rice, or other whole-grain rice (soaked in cold water for 1 hour, if possible)", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, thickly sliced (about 3 cups)", "Salt", "3 dried red Chinese peppers or 3 dried chiles de \u00e1rbol", "2 teaspoons minced ginger", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "Pinch of sugar (optional)", "2 pounds bok choy or other sturdy Asian greens, such as gai lan or mizuna, leaves cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces, ribs cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 8 cups)", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the rice: Rinse rice well and drain.
