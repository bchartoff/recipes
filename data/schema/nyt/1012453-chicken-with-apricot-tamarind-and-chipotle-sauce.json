{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken With Apricot, Tamarind and Chipotle Sauce", "description": "This Passover dish from Patricia Jinich came to The Times in 2009. For Ms. Jinich, who grew up in Mexico, one of 40,000 to 50,000 Jews, European and Mexican influences ran through Passover and holiday cooking: chicken soups with matzo might feature jalape\u00f1os, while meat stews were paired with salsa. Ms. Jinich learned this recipe from Flora Cohen, a woman of Syrian background who taught her and other Jewish brides in Mexico City how to cook. Here, a combination of dried apricots and apricot preserves give this chicken a savory sweetness, while chipotles in adobo add a little heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/apricotchicken-still/apricotchicken-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot", "keywords": "dairy-free, kosher, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 117}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 451, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "362 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 chicken, cut into 8 pieces", "1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, or to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste", "1/2 cup kosher for Passover vegetable oil", "3/4 cup dried apricots, roughly chopped", "3 tablespoons apricot preserves", "3 tablespoons tamarind concentrate", "1/4 cup sugar", "2 tablespoons sauce from chipotles in adobo", "1 or more chipotle peppers from chipotles in adobo, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken well with salt and pepper.
