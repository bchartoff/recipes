Instead of sugar and syrup, we just fold in Parmesan and Gruy\u00e8re, if I have some sitting in the refrigerator, and salt and pepper. We have a waffle iron that has shapes of animals and a barn, so I ask my kids, \u2018Do you want to be the pig today? Or the chicken? Or have a cow?\u2019?\u201d Try adding herbs and other seasonal produce, like pumpkin puree, to the batter instead of cheese. In the springtime you can add saut\u00e9ed and chopped asparagus to the batter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/17/health/Well_veggie_asparagus/Well_veggie_asparagus-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups waffle and pancake mix", "2 eggs", "2 cups milk", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "Salt and pepper", "3/4 cup grated rennet-free Parmesan cheese", "1/2 cup grated rennet-free Gruy\u00e8re or similar cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 200 degrees and place a waiting plate to warm inside.
