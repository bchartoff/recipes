{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Split Pea Soup With Horseradish Cream", "description": "Yellow or green split peas are consumed around the world because they are cheap, nonperishable and highly nutritious. Preparing them in a slow cooker makes for an affordable, delicious meal-in-a-bowl that requires nothing more than combining all of the ingredients, then simmering for several hours.
