{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy-Edged Quesadilla", "description": "This straightforward quesadilla has an unexpected twist: a border of salty, crispy cheese surrounding the tortilla. Achieving it couldn\u2019t be easier; just press down on the folded tortilla as it heats up in the pan so the cheese spills out and turns golden. A nonstick pan is key here, otherwise the melted cheese will glue itself onto the cooking surface. Medium heat is just the right temperature for a quesadilla: It\u2019s hot enough to crisp up the cheese but low enough to prevent the cheese from burning.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/22/dining/21beginner-rex5/merlin_208160703_2c8999fd-ad2e-4460-9321-d2a0c9b1a2da-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 quesadilla", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, weeknight, finger foods, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "cheese, flour tortillas, tortilla", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 398}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons oil (such as olive, grapeseed or sunflower oil)", "1 (8-inch) flour tortilla", "2/3 cup shredded cheese (such as Cheddar, Monterey Jack or Mexican cheese blend)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, then add the oil.
