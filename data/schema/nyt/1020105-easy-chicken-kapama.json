This weeknight version instead calls for boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which are are much less work and less time-consuming to prepare. Like most braised dishes, this one tastes even better once the flavors have had a chance to mingle, so it\u2019s an ideal make-ahead meal. Serve it over buttered egg noodles or orzo with a showering of grated Parmesan or Greek kefalotyri cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/18/dining/ch-chicken-kapama/merlin_151075185_c69e2424-12dc-4f5c-90ba-3ab5c58bedc7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thighs, cinnamon, cinnamon stick, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 385}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 414, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "47 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "875 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced", "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "1 to 2 cinnamon sticks", "Buttered egg noodles or orzo, for serving (optional)", "2 tablespoons fresh herbs, such as Italian parsley and oregano, roughly chopped (optional)", "Grated kefalotyri cheese or Parmesan, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken well on both sides with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the ground cinnamon.
