{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicago-Style Hot Dogs", "description": "Often described as \u201cdragged through the garden\u201d \u2014 referring to all of the vegetable toppings \u2014 this hot dog is a joy to eat in honor of the Windy City. A proper Chicago dog is an all-beef frankfurter (such as Vienna Beef) in a poppy seed bun, topped with yellow mustard, neon-green sweet pickle relish, chopped white onion, tomato slices, a dill pickle spear, pickled sport peppers and celery salt. This stovetop recipe is very forgiving, and there are ways to adapt: No poppy seed buns? Just sprinkle a pinch of loose poppy seeds over regular hot dog buns slathered in melted butter. No neon-green sweet relish? Stir a drop or two of green food coloring into regular sweet relish. If you can\u2019t find Chicago-style sport peppers, then sliced pepperoncini works in a pinch. Don\u2019t skip the celery salt; its herbal lightness makes these dogs shine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/27/dining/27Chicagodogrex/05Chicagodogrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sausages, main course", "keywords": "hot dogs, sport peppers, sweet pickle relish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 237}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 split poppy seed hot dog buns", "4 all-beef hot dogs, preferably bun-length", "Yellow mustard", "1/4 cup sweet pickle relish", "1 small white onion, small-diced", "1 small tomato, halved and thickly sliced lengthwise", "4 dill pickle spears", "4 to 8 sport peppers", "Celery salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet over medium, melt 2 tablespoons butter.
