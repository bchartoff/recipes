{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Turnips and Winter Squash With Agave Glaze", "description": "Traditionally, this dish, from the Great Plains, would include timpsula, the wild turnip that grows in patches across the region. (Old Lakota harvesting stories tell of how the timpsula point the forager from one plant to the next.) In Lakota homes, the turnips are often braided and dried for use throughout the winter. Unless you live in the region, fresh timpsula is difficult to come by, as it\u2019s not sold commercially. It\u2019s also milder and slightly denser than the garden turnips we\u2019ve substituted in this traditional pairing. The agave glaze adds a touch of sweetness to the vegetables, and the toasted sunflower seeds add crunch.
