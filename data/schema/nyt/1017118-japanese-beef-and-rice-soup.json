{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Japanese Beef and Rice Soup", "description": "When the chef Marco Canora was told to cut back on coffee, soda, wine and beer for health reasons, he found himself sipping cups of broth from the stockpots at his restaurant, Hearth, instead. Soon he had designed an entire system of healthful eating (and drinking) around the stuff. This soup, wintry but light, is a satisfying example. At Brodo, a takeout window that he opened in 2013, a to-go cup of broth can be customized in as many ways as an espresso at Starbucks \u2014 with ginger juice, mushroom tea and other aromatics and add-ons. This is easy to pull off at home, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/07/dining/07JPBROTH1/07JPBROTH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 8 cups", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, snack, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, beef broth, beef short ribs, shiitake", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 90}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 192, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "307 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["7 cups beef bone broth (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017117-beef-bone-broth\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>)", "10 to 12 ounces shredded cooked beef short ribs (from making broth, or use 1 pound shredded braised beef)", "1 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger", "3 1/2 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded, caps thinly sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 cup cooked brown rice", "1/2 cup nori crinkles (or slice up toasted nori sheets into 1/2-inch squares)", "2 tablespoons tamari", "Juice of 1/2 lemon", "1 bunch scallions, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring broth to a boil over high heat.
