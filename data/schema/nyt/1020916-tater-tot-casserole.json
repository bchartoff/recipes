{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tater Tot Casserole", "description": "I first ate this hot dish, a Midwestern favorite, on a late fall evening in the humid kitchen of the cook and television star Molly Yeh, at her farmhouse in Minnesota. The casserole accompanied venison, lefse and talk of the sugar beet harvest outside. I thrilled to the cream-beefy, umami-strong flavors that sat beneath its golden, cobbled exterior, and I loved the way the potatoes soaked up the gravy that pooled below the venison. You could substitute other ground meats for the beef, and other frozen vegetables for the peas or corn, but the tots are mandatory, and I do love the addition of cheese at the end.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/02/dining/ss-tater-tot-hot-dish/merlin_169778625_cfbd7722-2c0a-42af-a424-f69667f5c0c3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "carrot, cheddar, frozen peas, ground beef, potato, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 395}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup unsalted butter", "2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped", "2 celery stalks, finely chopped", "1 large white or yellow onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "3 cups whole milk", "2 tablespoons chicken, vegetable or beef broth base or bouillon", "2 pounds ground beef (about 15 percent fat)", "9 ounces frozen peas or corn, or a combination", "1 1/2 pounds frozen Tater Tots", "1 cup shredded Cheddar (optional)", "Chopped fresh parsley, for serving (optional)", "Ketchup, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
