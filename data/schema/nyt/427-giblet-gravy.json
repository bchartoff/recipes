Giblet gravy requires the cook to use the neck, gizzard and heart of the bird to make deeply flavored stock, which is then combined with the pan drippings, a bit of flour and wine or brandy. Finally, the cooked neck, gizzard and heart are finely chopped and added to the rich, savory gravy, to make for a more interesting texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/26/dining/26COOKING_GRAVY1/26COOKING_GRAVY1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "turkey gizzard, turkey heart, turkey necks", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 74}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large onions, peeled", "Turkey neck, gizzard and heart", "1 carrot, peeled and cut in half", "1 stalk celery, cut in halves", "A few sprigs of parsley", "6 whole peppercorns", "3 cups of water", "1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons flour", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons white wine or brandy (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "After turkey has been roasting for about an hour, slice one of the onions and scatter slices in roasting pan with turkey."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the other onion, cut in half, in a saucepan.
