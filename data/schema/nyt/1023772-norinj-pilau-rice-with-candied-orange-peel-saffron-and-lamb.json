{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Norinj Pilau (Rice With Candied Orange Peel, Saffron and Lamb)", "description": "The sour orange, unlike the sweet orange, is too tart to eat straight. But the peels, when cooked, lend a bright tang and profound fragrance. To make norinj pilau, a celebratory Afghan dish of lamb and rice, Shazia Saif Naimi recruits her husband, Asadullah Naimi, to harvest sour oranges from their backyard. He cuts the peels into skinny strips using a razor blade and brings them to a boil three times, to make sure that most (but, crucially, not all) of the peels\u2019 bitterness is leached out. Then he stirs in sugar, saffron and cardamom, and the scent of honey and white flowers expands through the house. Ms. Naimi braises the lamb and soaks the rice, massaging the grains to release the starch. At the end, lamb and rice are mounded together in a platter of abundance, with one cup of rice \u2014 simmered separately with the orange-peel syrup \u2014 spread over the top like spilled sun.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/08/magazine/08mag-Eat/08mag-Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, project, main course", "keywords": "afghan, basmati rice, cardamom, lamb shank, orange, pistachio, saffron, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 73}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups long-grain basmati rice, preferably aged", "1 tablespoon olive oil\u00a0", "3 pounds bone-in lamb shanks, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces (see Tip)", "Salt", "1 large onion, diced", "3 large or 5 small Seville or other sour oranges\u00a0", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "1/4 gram saffron, ground (1/8 teaspoon)", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom", "1/2 cup shelled pistachios, toasted and chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the rice: In a large bowl, wash the rice, massaging gently to release the starch without breaking the grains.
