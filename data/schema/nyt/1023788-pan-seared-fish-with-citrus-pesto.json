This naturally vegan version doesn\u2019t need cheese, because the citrus provides acidity and the capers and toasted nuts lend umami. Pistachios and almonds grow abundantly in Sicily, but walnuts or pine nuts would also work. You\u2019ll find citrus pestos made with anchovies, garlic, dried oregano, fennel fronds, dried chile and, yes, cheese, so feel free to adapt this base recipe as you wish. Italians historically don\u2019t mix seafood and cheese, but since this pesto eschews cheese, it\u2019s as good with pasta as it is with simply seared or grilled fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/05/multimedia/as-seared-fish-with-citrus-pesto-1-4a46/as-seared-fish-with-citrus-pesto-1-4a46-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, sauces and gravies, seafood, main course", "keywords": "almond, basil, caper, citrus, extra virgin olive oil, fish fillets, food processor, mint, pistachio, dairy-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 328}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup toasted pistachios or slivered almonds", "2 teaspoons drained and rinsed capers", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "2 cups mint or basil leaves (or a combination)", "1 tablespoon lemon, tangerine or grapefruit zest plus 3 tablespoons juice", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "4 (6-ounce) fish fillets, such as arctic char, striped bass or salmon, skin on or off", "Salt", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for greasing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the pesto, add the pistachios, capers and 1 teaspoon salt to a food processor and process until coarsely chopped.
