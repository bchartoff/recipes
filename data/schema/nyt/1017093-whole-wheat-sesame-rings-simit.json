{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Wheat Sesame Rings (Simit)", "description": "These look like bagels with bigger holes, but the bread is denser and defined by the thick coating of sesame seeds that gives them their delicious flavor.  I first encountered simit in Athens, then in Egypt, where they are a popular street food, as they are in Turkey. In the past I have dipped the rings into beaten egg before coating with sesame seeds. But I\u2019ve been looking at various recipes lately and see that many Turkish bakers dip their rings into grape or pomegranate molasses diffused with water before coating. I like this method because it enhances the browning effect during baking and leaves a slightly sweet flavor on the surface of the breads. Turkish bakers also sometimes add a ground mahlab (sour cherry kernels) to their dough for added flavor. One way to ensure that most of the sesame seeds will continue to adhere to the breads after they cool is to brush with egg white when you rotate the pans after 20 minutes of baking. The version I am giving you is made with a combination of semolina, all-purpose and (mostly) whole wheat flour, which is totally inauthentic but nevertheless, delicious. If you want a less dense bread, use half unbleached all purpose flour.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/30/science/recipehealthsesamerings/recipehealthsesamerings-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 rings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, snack, breads", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 246, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "42 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "233 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["85 grams / about 1/2 cup semolina flour", "95 grams / about 3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour", "330 grams / about 2 2/3 cups whole wheat flour", "1 1/4 teaspoons salt", "1 teaspoon ground mahlab (optional)", "3/4 teaspoon instant yeast", "1 1/2 cups / 355 ml lukewarm water", "1 tablespoon agave syrup, malt syrup, or honey", "1 egg, beaten or 2 tablespoons grape or pomegranate molasses dissolved in 1/4 cup water", "1 cup / 100 grams toasted sesame seeds", "Optional: 1 egg white, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine flours, salt and optional mahlab in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle and stir together or mix at low speed until combined.

Bake each sheet on the middle rack of the oven for 30 to 35 minutes (you can refrigerate the second baking sheet while the first one is baking to prevent the rings from rising too much), flipping the rings over so they don\u2019t brown too much on one side after 15 to 20 minutes, and if desired, brushing with egg white halfway through. Another way to prevent too much browning on the bottom is to slide another baking sheet under baking sheet (if you have enough of them to spare). Remove pan of water after 10 minutes. Rings should be dark brown and respond to tapping on the bottom with a hollow sound.
