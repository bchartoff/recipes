Older children with some experience can follow this recipe as is, but if you\u2019ve got little ones who want to help, they can stir the sage, beans and apple juice together in a large bowl while the sausages bake, then you can pour the mixture into the hot pan. If you like your beans on the saucy side, add 1/4 cup more apple juice. Serve with buttered crusty rolls and something leafy and green.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/dining/18kidsrex1/18kidsrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, beans, casseroles, sausages", "keywords": "apple juice, cannellini beans, pork sausage, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 289}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 616, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "879 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 sweet Italian pork sausages (about 1 pound)", "2 whole garlic cloves (do not peel)", "2 teaspoons olive oil", "2 fresh sage leaves", "2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained", "3/4 cup unsweetened apple juice", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
