You can use any nut you want with this, but do add some salt if you use unsalted nuts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/24/dining/24COOKING-PEANUTBRITTLE2/24COOKING-PEANUTBRITTLE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 1 pound", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, candies", "keywords": "dessert, peanut, sugar, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 158}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 327, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "6 milligrams", "sugarContent": "41 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter for greasing pan", "2 cups sugar", "2 cups roasted peanuts, salted or unsalted, or other nuts", "Salt, if using unsalted peanuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use a bit of butter to grease a baking sheet, preferably one with a low rim.
