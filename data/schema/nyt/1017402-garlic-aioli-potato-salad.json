If you don\u2019t want to add the hard-cooked eggs, use another 1/2 pound of potatoes instead. This is best served at least an hour or so after making to allow the flavors to mellow. Or make it the day before and store it in the refrigerator; bring it to room temperature before serving. If you can find garlic chives, there\u2019s no better place for them than here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20POTATO2/20POTATO2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "chives, potato, sour cream, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 395}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 379, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "161 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large eggs", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1 tablespoon lemon juice, more as needed", "1 large egg yolk", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup sour cream", "1/2 cup finely chopped celery", "1/4 cup finely chopped red onion", "2 pounds small waxy white or yellow potatoes, roughly about the same size", "Black pepper, as needed", "2 tablespoons finely chopped chives, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place 2 eggs in a small pot with water to cover.
