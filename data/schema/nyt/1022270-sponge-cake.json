The result is an airy, light-as-a-feather texture that\u2019s also moist, thanks to the addition of oil. Bake it in a jelly roll pan <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022271-raspberry-and-cream-roulade\">to create a roulade</a>, or in a 9-inch springform pan <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022272-strawberry-and-cream-layer-cake\">for a layer cake</a>, but don\u2019t use a nonstick pan, as the cake will collapse. The 9-inch cake needs nothing more than a little whipped cream on top. Any kind of macerated fruit would be perfect, but ultimately a bonus.
