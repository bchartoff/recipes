{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Stock", "description": "This recipe for an intense, lovely chicken stock is full of deep flavors and provides a perfect base for soup. Feel free to use leftover bones from roast chicken, but at least half of the bones should be raw. Ask your butcher for feet, heads and wings, which are all high in gelatin and will lend body to the stock. Once cooled, freeze the stock in old 32-ounce yogurt containers, which have the added benefit of being premeasured.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/11/dining/11SOUPS14/11SOUPS14-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H", "recipeYield": "About 6 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "carrots, celery, chicken bones, onion, parsley, thyme, low calorie", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 193}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 2, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "6 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds raw chicken bones", "6 quarts water", "2 onions, unpeeled, quartered", "2 carrots, peeled and halved crosswise", "2 celery stalks, halved crosswise", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "2 bay leaves<a href=\"#_msocom_2\"></a>", "4 thyme sprigs", "5 parsley sprigs (or 10 stems)", "1 tablespoon white-wine vinegar<a href=\"#_msocom_3\"></a>"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put everything but the vinegar in a large stockpot.
