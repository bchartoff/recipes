{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Chocolate Pudding", "description": "Dense, creamy and fudgy, this pudding is meant to be made in a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker like an Instant Pot. You can bake this recipe as one larger pudding or as individual servings. \n\nIt can be made in a stovetop pressure cooker, by trimming a few minutes off the cooking time, or you can also bake the individual servings in a water bath in the oven. To do so, heat the oven to 300 degrees. Set the filled, uncovered custard cups in a large roasting pan positioned on the oven's center rack. Add hot tap water to the pan, halfway up the sides of cups. Cover the entire pan with foil, and use a fork to prick holes in foil. Bake until edges are lightly set (lifting the foil to check) but the centers are still jiggly \u2013 they will set as they cool \u2013 30 to 35 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/01/dining/01APPE2-1485571646973/01APPE2-1485571646973-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, weekday, custards and puddings", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, heavy cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 197}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 434, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "83 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups heavy cream", "1/2 cup whole milk", "6 ounces bittersweet chocolate (preferably 60 percent to 65 percent), chopped", "5 large egg yolks", "1/3 cup light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract, or 1 tablespoon dark rum or bourbon", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom or cinnamon (optional)", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or whipped cream, for serving", "Chocolate shavings, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a heavy saucepan, bring cream and milk to a simmer.
