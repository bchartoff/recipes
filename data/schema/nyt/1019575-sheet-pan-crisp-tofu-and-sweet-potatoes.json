{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Crisp Tofu and Sweet Potatoes", "description": "Tossing marinated tofu squares in cornstarch before roasting makes them wonderfully crunchy and brown. Here, the tofu is cooked alongside spears of sweet potato, which are soft and silky against the crisp squares. A tamari-honey dressing spiked with rice wine vinegar acts both as marinade for the tofu and sauce for the finished dish. Then quick-pickled scallions and hot sesame oil make for a bright and spicy garnish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/dining/26apperex3/26apperex3-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "fall, winter, hot sesame chile oil, sweet potato, tamari, tofu, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 383}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 298, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "843 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut crosswise into 4 1-inch thick slices", "2 tablespoons peanut oil, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons tamari", "1 1/2 teaspoons honey", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "4 medium sweet potatoes (about 8 ounces each), cut lengthwise into 3/4-inch wedges", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "4 scallions, cut into 3-inch pieces and thinly sliced lengthwise", "Large\u00a0pinch of sugar", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves", "Hot sesame chile oil, or red-pepper flakes, for serving", "Salted, roasted peanuts, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
