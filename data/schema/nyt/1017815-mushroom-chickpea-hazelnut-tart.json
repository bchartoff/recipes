{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom Chickpea Hazelnut Tart", "description": "Savory pies and tarts are go-to dishes at Thanksgiving. They can be made well in advance and they make a great main course for guests who are not eating turkey.\n\nWe chose this recipe from Kathy Patalsky, a vegan blogger in Los Angeles, to represent the savory pie in our Vegetarian Thanksgiving series. We liked that it was easy (she suggests a pre-made crust) and the hazelnuts make it a great option for the winter holidays as well.\n\n\u201cThese flavors are rustic, filling, cozy and festive,\u201d Ms. Patalsky wrote. \u201cI adore pot pies and tarts for main dish entrees. You can easily slice them like pies and serve to guests in an elegant way.\"", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/12/science/welltart/welltart-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H5M", "recipeYield": "8 slices", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fall, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 382, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "322 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 premade vegan pie crust", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "3 cups mixed mushrooms, chopped", "1/2 cup white onion, chopped", "3 leaves fresh sage, finely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/8 teaspoon black pepper", "1/3 cup nutritional yeast", "1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped", "2/3 cup hazelnuts, raw", "16 oz canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1/4 cup fresh orange juice", "1/4 teaspoon orange zest", "2/3 cup vegetable broth", "2 medjool dates, pitted and diced", "1 cup kale, finely chopped, loosely packed", "1/3 cup fine corn meal", "1/2 cup red bell pepper, diced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
