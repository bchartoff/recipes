The writer Priya Krishna\u2019s father has been making yogurt at the family\u2019s home in Dallas for as long as she can remember, using a yogurt culture he has kept going for more than 25 years. No store-bought yogurt has ever held a candle to the homemade version, which is thick and pleasantly tangy. You can really taste the milk. (Organic milk will often yield a creamier result.)\u00a0You may have been told that you need special machines and containers to make yogurt, but this recipe, which appears in her 2019 cookbook \u201cIndian-ish,\u201d is quite simple: All that\u2019s required is a heavy-bottomed pot and an oven. You can use one batch of yogurt as the culture for the next, and watch your yogurt evolve over time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/27/dining/27yogurtrex-1/27yogurtrex-1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "1 quart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "milk, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 63, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "45 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups whole milk, preferably organic", "1/4 cup full-fat yogurt with live active cultures (check the ingredient list)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Evenly coat the bottom of a medium Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot with a thin, 1/4-inch-thick layer of water.

Let the milk cool until it reaches 130 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes.
