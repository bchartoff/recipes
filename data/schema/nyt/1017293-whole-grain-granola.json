Vary the types and amounts of puffed and rolled (also called flaked) grains, coconut and nuts to suit your taste, as long as you use eight cups altogether. And feel free to add chopped dried fruit at the end, stirring it into the granola mix while it\u2019s still warm. If you want to add spices, stir a mix of ground cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom into the honey mixture before baking. It\u2019s easy to make this recipe your own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/18/dining/18APPETITE1/18APPETITE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 8 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "barley, honey, kamut, raw almonds, raw pepitas, unsweeetened coconut chips, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 262}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 313, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "144 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups puffed kamut (or use other puffed whole grains, such as barley or wheat)", "2 cups rolled barley (or use rolled oats, rolled spelt, rolled triticale or rolled rye)", "1 1/2 cups raw (untoasted) nuts, such as whole almonds, walnuts or pecans, or a combination", "1 cup unsweetened coconut chips or shredded coconut", "1 cup raw pepitas (pumpkin seeds)", "2/3 cup honey", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/3 cup dark brown sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees.
