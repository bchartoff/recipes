{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Enchiladas Con Carne", "description": "There are a few cool tricks to this recipe, one of which I picked up from an old issue of Bon App\u00e9tit, one I learned from Robb Walsh, the great Tex-Mex scholar and restaurateur who runs El Real Tex-Mex in Houston, and a final one I learned by happenstance. First, for the thickening agent in the chile sauce, toast raw all-purpose flour in a pan until it is nutty and golden brown, then reserve it to stir in with the browned beef later in the recipe. Second, if you like truly melty cheese in the classic Tex-Mex tradition, use a mixture of American cheese, like Velveeta, with the Cheddar you use inside and on top of the finished enchiladas. Finally, if you\u2019re fearful that a casserole of cheese, chili and fried tortillas may be a little rich for dinner, serve it with a bowl of <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018058-tomatillo-pineapple-salsa\">tomatillo pineapple salsa</a> on the side. The acidity provides a nice balance. (Note also that as with all recipes, but particularly this one, some planning and practice can get the preparation down to 60 minutes.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/20/dining/enchiladas/enchiladas-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "casseroles", "keywords": "Cheddar, chicken stock, corn tortillas, ground beef, tomatoes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1282}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 756, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "851 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola", "1 pound ground chuck beef, ideally 20 percent fat", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper, to taste", "1 medium white onion, peeled and chopped", "2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "1 jalape\u00f1o pepper or more to taste, seeds removed if you want it less spicy, stemmed and chopped", "1 cup chopped or canned crushed tomatoes", "3 tablespoons chile powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, ideally Mexican", "2 cups chicken stock, ideally homemade or low-sodium if store-bought", "1/2 cup neutral oil, like canola", "12 yellow corn tortillas", "3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, or a mixture of 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese and 1 1/2 cups American cheese, like Velveeta", "1 medium-size white onion, peeled and chopped (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chili con carne: Put flour in a large saut\u00e9 pan set over medium-high heat.
