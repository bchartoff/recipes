{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hoisin-Glazed Pork Bowl With Vegetables", "description": "Inspired by Chinese char siu pork, this weeknight recipe uses an easy cooking method that yields a tasty sauce with a subtle sweetness. The tangy hoisin marinade for the pork can do its job in just 24 seconds or 24 hours. It coats the tenderloin as it cooks, leaving behind caramelized bits in the bottom of pan, which then get deglazed to create a dressing that flavors the rice. As for the garnishes, use as many crisp-tender vegetables as you like, and change them up as you please. Sugar snap peas would be good here, as would shredded napa cabbage, or just about anything fresh and crunchy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/13/dining/ssp-glazed-pork-bowl/ssp-glazed-pork-bowl-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, meat, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "carrot, hoisin sauce, pork tenderloin, radish, fall, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 969}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup hoisin sauce", "2 tablespoons ketchup", "2 tablespoons honey", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "2 teaspoons Sriracha", "1 large garlic clove, grated on a Microplane", "1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder", "1 pork tenderloin (about 1 to 1 1/4 pounds), cut crosswise into thirds", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 teaspoons vegetable oil", "2 small carrots, peeled", "2 large radishes (such as watermelon), or 4 small", "4 scallions", "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar", "4 cups cooked brown or black rice", "2 ounces snow peas, trimmed", "Pickled ginger (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine hoisin, ketchup, honey, ginger, Sriracha, garlic and five-spice powder."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season pork with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then add to the marinade.
