{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn and Celery Stir-Fry", "description": "Corn kernels stir-fried with pine nuts is a northern Chinese dish that shows off the versatility of fresh, sweet corn. While frozen kernels would work in a pinch, this dish is best made with corn at its peak; stir-frying at high heat for just a few minutes locks in the summer sweetness and ensures that every kernel stays plump and juicy. Similarly, flash-fried celery becomes highly perfumed while retaining its crunch. Pine nuts deliver pops of buttery nuttiness, but you could also use cashews or peanuts in their place. Eat alone as a light meal or with rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/07/dining/07hm-corn-and-celery-stir-fry/merlin_209335116_57f76e7f-c85a-43f2-a160-e13c1e08f31c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "celery, corn, pine nuts, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 186}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)", "1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped", "4 scallions, white and green parts separated and cut into 1-inch pieces", "4 cups corn kernels (from 4 to 6 corn cobs)", "2 celery stalks, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 teaspoon white or black pepper", "1/2 cup pine nuts (or coarsely chopped cashews or peanuts)", "1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "White or brown rice (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large 12-inch skillet or wok on medium-high.
