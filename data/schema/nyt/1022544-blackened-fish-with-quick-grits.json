{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blackened Fish With Quick Grits", "description": "Blackening is a cooking technique that uses high heat and lots of seasoning to develop distinctive flavor by nearly charring the food in a cast-iron skillet. It\u2019s particularly good for firm, lean white fish, such as catfish, snapper, trout or redfish. The fish is traditionally dipped in melted butter, then cooked in a dry skillet, but that can create billows of smoke. This smokeless method cooks seasoned fillets in oil to create a lovely texture. The cheese grits cook in just under 5 minutes, but are extra flavorful from cooking in chicken stock and still creamy as a result of added milk and butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/07/dining/VL-blackened-fish-quick-grit/merlin_194143413_6767739c-fe58-4a0d-90cd-06b30dcb2d87-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "fish, grits, spices, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1693}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme", "2 1/4 teaspoons dried oregano", "1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cayenne, depending on heat preference", "4 (5 to 6-ounce) skinless white fish fillets, such as snapper, catfish, trout or tilapia", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "Sliced scallions, for garnish", "Lemon wedges, for serving", "3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken stock or water", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste", "1 cup quick-cooking grits", "1/2 cup whole milk", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup grated sharp Cheddar, plus more for garnish", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the fish: In a small bowl, whisk together the sweet paprika, black pepper, thyme, oregano, garlic powder, salt and cayenne.
