You have to whip the egg whites using an electric mixer, so this is definitely a weekend or holiday affair, but goodness, are they ever worth it. Serve with blueberries or raspberries and a dollop of plain yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Moira Hodgson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/27/dining/27COOKING-LEMONPANCAKE1/17COOKING-LEMONPANCAKE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "12 three-inch pancakes", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, quick, pancakes", "keywords": "eggs, flour, lemon zest, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 633}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 84, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "82 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 eggs, separated", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup cottage cheese", "1/4 cup (half a stick) butter, melted, plus more butter for greasing skillet", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 tablespoon grated lemon zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, stir together the egg yolks, flour, cottage cheese, butter, sugar, salt and lemon zest until well mixed.
