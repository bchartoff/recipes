You have to plan ahead \u2013 it needs to sit in the refrigerator overnight \u2013 and it requires the preparation of a simple caramel sauce, but it's absolutely, 100% worth the effort. Once the sauce is done, swirl it around the bottom of a pie pan, fill it with slices of challah, then saturate it with a slurry of eggs, sugar, mascarpone cheese, milk and a dash of almond extract. Let it rest overnight, bake and invert on a platter. Serve with a dollop of mascarpone or fromage blanc to cut the sweetness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/09/dining/09COOKING-BREADPUDDING2/09COOKING-BREADPUDDING2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, breads, custards and puddings", "keywords": "challah bread, eggs, mascarpone, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 211}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 644, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "573 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "6 tablespoons butter", "12 to 15 slices brioche or challah bread (all should be about 1/2-inch thick and about 3 inches round; cut accordingly)", "8 eggs", "1/4 cup mascarpone cheese", "1 cup milk", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "1/4 cup coarsely chopped toasted almonds", "About 3/4 cup fromage or fromage blanc, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat a 9-inch ceramic or Pyrex pie dish in a 350 oven.
