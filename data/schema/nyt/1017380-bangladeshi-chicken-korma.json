{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bangladeshi Chicken Korma", "description": "Homestyle Bangladeshi chicken korma is likely more aromatic, flavorful, and deeply chicken-flavored than the heavy, creamy versions served in Indian restaurants. This recipe, adapted from Shama Mubdi, is also incredibly easy to make: You just stir everything together in a pot and turn on the heat. A last-minute addition of butter-fried onions adds sweet complexity. Serve with basmati rice and salad or South Asian pickles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Francis Lam"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/03/magazine/03eat1/03eat1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, curries", "keywords": "cardamom pods, chicken, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 407}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 652, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "741 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds skinless, bone-in chicken pieces (preferably dark meat)", "1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste", "1 medium onion, peeled", "1 1 1/2-inch knob of ginger, peeled and chopped", "3 cloves garlic, chopped", "1/2 cup whole-milk yogurt", "4 to 6 green cardamom pods, cracked open", "3 to 5 cloves", "2 bay leaves", "1 3-inch stick cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns", "2 to 3 small hot green chiles (optional)", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the chicken in a medium Dutch oven, and season with 1 teaspoon salt.
