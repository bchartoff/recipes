{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sticky Toffee Whole-Wheat Date Cake", "description": "This cake is a showstopper that a baker with rudimentary skills could pull off. The topping is a toffee glaze made with brown sugar, agave, butter and sea salt; you pour half of it over the cake while still hot so that it saturates the cake, giving it a puddinglike consistency, then wait before using the rest as a high-gloss frosting you sprinkle with sea salt. Seemingly complicated, but surprisingly simple.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Oliver Strand"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28SQIRL3-WEB/28SQIRL3-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "9 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "agave nectar, dates, dried currants, whole wheat flour, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 166}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 570, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "93 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "355 milligrams", "sugarContent": "66 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["14 tablespoons/200 grams unsalted butter (1 3/4 sticks), at room temperature, more for the pan", "8 ounces/225 grams pitted dates, chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 cup/80 grams dried currants", "1 cup/130 grams whole-wheat flour", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/80 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3/4 cup/165 grams packed light brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/170 grams agave nectar", "1/2 cup/110 grams packed light brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 tablespoons/28 grams unsalted butter", "Fleur de sel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat oven to 325 degrees and butter an 8-inch square or 9-inch round cake pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small pot, combine dates, lemon juice and 3/4 cup/180 milliliters water.
