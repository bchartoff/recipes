{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peanut-Butter Fudge", "description": "Traditionally, fudge is made by boiling sugar and flavorings to a specific temperature, then cooling it, and finally beating it for just the right amount of time. It\u2019s not hard to do, but if the conditions are not just right, the texture of the finished fudge can be too soft, too hard or even unpleasantly grainy. This peanut butter fudge may not be traditional, but it\u2019s much simpler to make properly and results in the creamiest confection imaginable. For a delicious textural contrast, don\u2019t skip the toppings!", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/05/dining/SSE-peanut-butter-fudge-rex/SSE-peanut-butter-fudge-rex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H10M", "recipeYield": "25 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, candies, dessert", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, dark brown sugar, make-ahead, peanut butter, vanilla extract, halloween", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 356}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/246 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "12 tablespoons/170 grams salted butter", "1/2 cup/110 grams dark brown sugar", "1 (16-ounce) jar conventional creamy peanut butter (such as Skippy)", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "Roasted, salted peanuts, roughly chopped, and mini chocolate chips, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper with a 2-inch overhang on two sides.\u00a0 In a large bowl, set the confectioners\u2019 sugar.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, melt the butter over medium heat.
