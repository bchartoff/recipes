{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Perfect Black and White Cookies", "description": "Tender, moist and scented with vanilla, almond and lemon, these classic confections popular all over the Midwest and the state of New York are more cake than cookie, with a fine crumb and velvet texture from the sour cream in the batter. Even better, they are glazed with both vanilla and chocolate, so you don\u2019t have to pick favorites. These are best eaten within 24 hours of baking, when the cake is at its softest and the glaze at its snappiest. But if you store them in an airtight container at room temperature, they\u2019ll be good for a few days longer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/09/dining/mc-black-and-white-cookie/mc-black-and-white-cookie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "cocoa powder, sour cream, unsweetened chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 449}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters sour cream or whole-milk yogurt", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters whole milk", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/200 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 1/2 cups/300 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Boiling water, as needed", "1 1/2 tablespoons light corn syrup", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "2 1/2 ounces/70 grams unsweetened chocolate, melted and cooled", "2 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
