{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaghetti With Salmon Two Ways", "description": "To dress pasta? Olive oil, of course. But that was until I tried a generously buttered spaghetti at Arakataka restaurant in Oslo. Only after I unwound the disarmingly simple knot of fresh pasta strands tossed with butter and crowned with fish roe did the sumptuous complexity of flavors start to bloom. This was a dish I knew I would try to replicate at home. The challenge was the roe. The restaurant used lojrom, also called bleak roe, a fairly fine-grained roe that is popular in Scandinavia but hard to find in the United States. Other roes, like golden whitefish, trout and salmon, may be substituted. For a somewhat more substantial preparation, I added some hot-smoked salmon, ripe tomato and a hint of lemon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/dining/16pairingweb/16pairingweb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Yield 2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, pastas", "keywords": "beefsteak tomatoes, hot-smoked salmon, salmon roe, spaghetti, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 45}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 480, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "492 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Grated zest of 1 lemon", "1 medium-large ripe beefsteak tomato, peeled, seeded and diced (about 1 cup)", "4 ounces hot-smoked salmon, skinned, diced", "1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint leaves", "8 ounces spaghetti alla chitarra, preferably fresh", "Ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons salmon or trout roe"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.
