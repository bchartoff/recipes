The chocolate is of the utmost importance here; its flavor will be the one that dominates, so be sure to buy the highest quality you can. Top with shaved chocolate if you'd like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/26/dining/26COOKING-CHOCTOFUPIE1/26COOKING-CHOCTOFUPIE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, pies and tarts", "keywords": "chocolate, cinnamon, graham cracker crumbs, tofu, dessert, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 486}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 whole graham crackers (approximately 5.5 ounces)", "3 tablespoons sugar", "4 tablespoons melted melted coconut oil", "1 tablespoon plain soy milk or almond milk", "3/4 cup sugar", "1 pound silken tofu", "8 ounces high-quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, melted (at least 60 percent cacao)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon chile powder, or more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "Chocolate shavings (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the crust", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees and lightly spray a 9-inch pie plate with nonstick cooking spray."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the graham crackers in a food processor and process until finely ground, about 30 seconds (you should have about 1 1/4 cups of crumbs).
