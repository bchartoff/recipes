{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Five-Ingredient Creamy Miso Pasta", "description": "This one-pot pasta comes together in minutes, and requires zero prep and minimal cleanup. It builds on the classic combination of pasta, butter and cheese with a spoonful of miso paste for complexity. But you could experiment with using any other condiments or spices you have on hand, such as red pesto, curry paste or ground turmeric in place of the miso. To achieve a silky smooth pasta, you\u2019ll need to put your cacio e pepe skills to work: Vigorously toss the pasta, grated cheese and pasta water together to achieve a properly emulsified, silky-smooth sauce. Top with shrimp, edamame, frozen peas or any steamed vegetable. The optional nori or furikake imparts an unexpected flavor of the sea, and it\u2019s worth using if you have it on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/dining/aw-miso-pasta/aw-miso-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "butter, miso, parmesan, spaghetti, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "16 ounces spaghetti, linguine or bucatini", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons white (or red) miso", "4 ounces Parmesan, finely grated (1 packed cup)", "Kizami nori, furikake or thinly sliced seaweed snacks, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
