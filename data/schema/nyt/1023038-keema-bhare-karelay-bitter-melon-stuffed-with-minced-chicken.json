This divisive vegetable needs a bit of coaxing to truly shine, and, in this recipe, marinating the peeled and cored melon in salt draws out the lion\u2019s share of its bitterness. The result is a delicately pungent flavor perfectly suited to the vegetable\u2019s texture. There are two varieties of bitter melon: This recipe, a common preparation in Pakistan and Northern India, calls for the South Asian type (often labeled \u201cIndian\u201d), which is a darker green and has more pronounced ridges and tapered tips than the Chinese variety. The melons are stuffed with a ground chicken filling that comes together quickly and can be prepared up to two days ahead. Though this dish is rewarding for those who already have a taste for bitter foods, its adaptability makes it the perfect gateway for cultivating one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zainab Shah"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/15/dining/zs-bitter-melon/zs-bitter-melon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "garlic, ground chicken, thai chili", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 7}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound bitter melon (about 5 medium), peeled", "3 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 cup mustard oil, ghee or any neutral oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon ginger paste or freshly grated ginger", "1 teaspoon garlic paste or freshly grated garlic (about 2 cloves)", "1 pound ground chicken", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1/4 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon kashmiri red chile powder or other ground red chile", "1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 medium plum tomato, finely chopped", "3 fresh Thai green chiles, stems removed, chopped", "2 to 3 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, from about 1/2 lemon", "Roti or store-bought pita, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make a slit along the length of each melon, leaving about an inch intact on the ends.
