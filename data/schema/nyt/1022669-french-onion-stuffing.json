{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "French Onion Stuffing", "description": "Golden caramelized onions and mushrooms are the building blocks of this vegetarian stuffing inspired by French onion soup. The onions take some time to cook, but the meltingly tender result brings rich sweetness to the dish. Mushrooms are added for their texture, and mushroom broth reinforces the stuffing with more depth. An initial steam helps soften the big mound of raw onions to make caramelizing them easier and faster. The onions can be cooked the day before (through Step 3) and refrigerated, then rewarmed before using.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/14/dining/14sidesgiving-onionstuffing/merlin_196269432_d8bb443c-200a-4a60-9b9d-2f872891e02d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, stuffing and dressing, side dish", "keywords": "thanksgiving, white mushrooms, yellow onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 518}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (1-pound) country bread loaf, cut into 1- to 1\u00bd-inch pieces", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "4 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola oil", "2 cups finely chopped celery (from about 4 ribs)", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "4 ounces whole white mushrooms, finely chopped (1 1/4 cups)", "Salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, plus 1 thyme sprig", "4 pounds yellow onions, halved and thinly sliced (16 packed cups)", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "3 cups mushroom broth", "3 large eggs, beaten", "Chopped chives, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
