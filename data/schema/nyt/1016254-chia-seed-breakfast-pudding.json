{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chia Seed Breakfast Pudding", "description": "Chia seeds are nutritionally dense seeds that will thicken any liquid you add them to. Mix them up with coconut and almond milks and you\u2019ve got an almost instant pudding with a tapioca-like texture and gently sweet flavor. This recipe is meant for breakfast, but if you add a little honey to the seeds as they swell, it will be sweet enough for dessert. You can use either black or white chia seeds here, or a mix. The pudding will continue to thicken as it sits, so feel free to thin it out to taste with a little more almond or coconut milk before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/16/dining/16takeaway/16takeaway-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, apricot, chia seeds, coconut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 188}, "recipeIngredient": ["130 grams whole dried apricots (about 20), more as needed", "1/3 cup passion-fruit juice or nectar (passion fruit-pear is fine)", "50 grams sugar (3 tablespoons) ", "1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice", "Fine sea salt, as needed", "2 cups unsweetened almond milk", "1/2 cup coconut milk", "85 grams chia seeds (1/2 cup)", "45 grams toasted kasha (1/4 cup), optional (see note)", "Roasted whole almonds, coarsely chopped, as needed", "Toasted unsweetened coconut flakes, as needed", "Sliced banana, as needed, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Coarsely chop half of the dried apricots.
