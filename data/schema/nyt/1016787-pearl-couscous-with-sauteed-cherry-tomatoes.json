{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pearl Couscous With Saut\u00e9ed Cherry Tomatoes", "description": "This is a simple dish with few ingredients and lots of flavor. The sauce, inspired by Melissa Clark\u2019s pasta with burst cherry tomatoes, is incredibly sweet and wraps itself around each nugget of couscous in the most delicious way. Cherry tomatoes break down in a hot pan in about five minutes, collapsing just enough to release some juice, which quickly thickens and caramelizes a bit. You want the tomatoes to stay partially intact so that you don\u2019t just get skins floating in sauce, but you need to cook them long enough to achieve the caramelized flavor that makes a tomato sauce sweet. You can cook the couscous a couple of days ahead and reheat in a pan with a little olive oil or in the microwave.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/02/science/02recipehealth/02recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "main course", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 694}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 301, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1522 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups pearl couscous", "2 quarts water", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, minced or pur\u00e9ed", "1 pound (about 3 cups) cherry tomatoes, the sweetest you can find, cut in half", "1/4 teaspoon sugar", "Salt to taste", "1 sprig basil", "2 tablespoons, or more, slivered basil leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add couscous.
