{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Roasted Chickpeas With Lemon-Garlic Mayonnaise", "description": "This recipe is inspired by the popular Spanish tapa patatas bravas, or papas bravas, crispy potatoes that are typically served with a paprika-stained sauce or a garlic aioli. Here, chickpeas crisped in the oven instead of the fryer are seasoned with smoked paprika and ground cayenne, then swaddled in a garlicky mayonnaise cut with lemon. Eat half a batch of these chickpeas for a great dinner, or eat them over lemon-dressed lettuces or parsley, steamed greens, pasta, toast or a fried egg. You can also roast another vegetable with the chickpeas, like cauliflower, broccoli, potatoes or carrots for a complete one-pan meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/10/dining/as-chickpeas-bravas/merlin_173401602_5a959030-89ab-4f1d-a414-b4081ec09cb9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, weekday, beans, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cayenne pepper, chickpea, garlic, lemon, lemon zest, mayonnaise, olive oil, smoked paprika", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained, rinsed and patted very dry", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon juice (from 1 lemon)", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1/4 cup mayonnaise", "1 garlic clove, finely grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
