{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Marinated Swordfish Steaks", "description": "Swordfish, with its firm, lean flesh, is an ideal candidate for grilling. It's not as forgiving as some fatty fish, like tuna and black sea bass, so proceed with caution. If you remove the fish from the fire when the center is still slightly pink, by the time it gets to the table it should be cooked through. A quick marinade of soy sauce, red wine vinegar, rosemary, garlic, coriander and cumin pairs beautifully with the meatiness of the fish, but do not marinate for more than 10 to 15 minutes, or the acid will break down the flesh and leave it mushy (or the flavor will overpower the fish). If you don't have a grill, this works equally well in a broiler. Serve this alongside a colorful pile of Pierre Franey\u2019s <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10047-string-bean-and-tomato-salad\">green bean and tomato salad</a>.
