{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta al Pomodoro", "description": "Pomodoro, the Italian word for tomato, comes from pomo d\u2019oro (\u201cgolden apple\u201d), and also refers to this sauce. A good pomodoro leans into the inherently savory, umami-rich flavor of the tomatoes, so use the best ones you can find. Any combination of low-water, high-flavor tomatoes like plum, grape, cherry and Campari, cooked down to their purest essence, makes for the most vibrant result. Thin spaghetti works best here, as its airy bounciness catches the pulpy tomato sauce beautifully, but regular spaghetti would taste great, too. Add basil at the end, if you\u2019d like, or a dusting of cheese, but a stalwart pasta al pomodoro made with peak-season tomatoes needs neither.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/21/dining/21EAT-EK-pasta-al-pomodoro/merlin_211545387_5042dbc4-2fa7-4ec9-b10e-b39ccd0ed5fa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas, main course, side dish", "keywords": "tomatoes, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1169}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "4 large garlic cloves, lightly crushed and peeled", "3 pounds ripe tomatoes (any mix of plum, grape, cherry and Campari), coarsely chopped", "Salt", "1 pound thin spaghetti"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the olive oil and garlic to a large Dutch oven or high-sided skillet.
