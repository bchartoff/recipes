Meanwhile, build a fire in a kettle-style grill using about 50 briquettes. When the coals are ready, divide evenly on each side of the grill, leaving a space in the center. Place about 7 fresh briquettes on top of the already burning ones. Lay a medium-size disposable pan in the open space to catch the grease. Place the seasoned ribs on a roasting rack, high above the coals, in the center of the kettle. Cover and roast for 30 minutes. Turn and roast 35 more minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the sauce, mix together all of the ingredients except the lemon and stir to combine completely. squeeze the juice from the lemon into the mixture and then drop the lemon slices in as well and stir."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "After the ribs have been roasted, remove the grill rack from the kettle. Remove the grease pan and rake the coals out evenly. Replace the grill rack. Use a brush to baste the ribs generously with sauce, turning the ribs as soon as the side facing the heat begins to sizzle and caramelize around the edges. Baste and glaze the ribs at least 5 times on each side. They're done when they just begin to blacken in some spots. Use a sharp knife to separate the ribs, and serve."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6705-eddies-remarkable-ribs"}
