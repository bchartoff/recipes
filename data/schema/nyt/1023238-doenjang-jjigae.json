{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Doenjang Jjigae", "description": "A well-executed doenjang jjigae, or fermented soybean paste stew, can be a quiet but powerful exercise in restraint. This simple recipe allows the umami-rich flavor of the doenjang (DWEN-jahng) and the natural sweetness of onion, zucchini and radish to shine. The oil-packed anchovies here may not be as traditional as dried, but they are an effective substitute that I learned from my friend James Park. You can make this dish vegan by skipping the anchovies and swapping the slightly lily-gilding rib-eye steak for cubed medium-firm tofu.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/15ESSENTIALSrex1/merlin_207573285_7208fb53-fc89-4a1f-a7c2-d74643b35dd6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, meat, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "doenjang, kombu, steak", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 109}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons doenjang, plus more to taste (see Tip)", "4 garlic cloves, crushed and coarsely chopped", "1 small red onion, cut into medium dice", "1 medium zucchini, cut into medium dice", "5 ounces Korean radish, peeled, quartered, then thinly sliced crosswise", "3 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps thinly sliced", "1 (4-inch) square dasima (dried kelp), cracked into small pieces", "4 oil-packed anchovies, drained", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "Salt", "1 thin, boneless rib-eye steak (about 6 ounces), cut into 1-inch pieces", "Steamed white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To a medium pot, add the doenjang, garlic, onion, zucchini, radish, mushrooms, dasima, anchovies, soy sauce and 3 cups cold tap water, and season lightly with salt.
