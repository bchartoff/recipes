If you can\u2019t find \u2019nduja at your local supermarket, feel free to swap in your favorite fresh chorizo or pork sausage and a flurry of red-pepper flakes. Be sure to pick a pasta that can hold this hefty sauce. The deep pockets in orecchiette will do nicely, capturing flavor in every bite. The trick here is to allow the pasta to finish cooking right in the garlicky sauce, which is thickened by the starchy pasta cooking water. A topping of lemony bread crumbs adds texture and brightness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/19/dining/YK-orecchiette-with-nduja/YK-orecchiette-with-nduja-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "broccoli rabe, nduja, orecchiette, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 80}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 794, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "81 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "49 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1123 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "12 ounces orecchiette", "2 slices day-old Italian bread, cut about 1/2-inch thick and torn into small pieces, or 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "Zest and juice from 1/2 lemon", "2 tablespoons chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley", "2 shallots, sliced", "4 garlic cloves, sliced", "4 ounces \u2019nduja, or fresh chorizo or pork sausage, casings removed", "1 (14.5-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes and their juices", "12 ounces shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails removed, meat finely chopped", "2 cups roughly chopped broccoli rabe (about 1/4 pound)", "Red-pepper flakes (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high.
