{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pear and Sour Cherry Brown Betty With Brandy Hard Sauce", "description": "Most brown betties are made with sweetened apple slices. To mix things up a bit, I made mine with pears, and threw in some brandy-soaked dried cherries to accentuate the brandy I\u2019d used to season the hard sauce. As soon as the pear betty emerges from the oven, spooned out a portion and cover it with lumps of hard sauce. The sauce melts on contact, dripping goodness into the fruit and soaking into the crevices of the toasted bread topping.
