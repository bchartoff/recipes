{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Melon and Avocado Salad With Fennel and Chile", "description": "This sweet-savory, crunchy-creamy dish nods to California summers, when a drive to the market can often end with avocados and melons buckled in the back seat. The recipe is simple, and instantly impressive: It involves little more than scooping out the fresh fruit and topping it with a spicy-sweet pinch of sugar and a drizzle of dressing. Rubbing toasted fennel seeds, red-pepper flakes and lemon zest into sugar and salt helps their floral kick travel far. The salad\u2019s balance depends on your melon and avocado, so rely on taste more than measurements here. Adjust the ingredients as needed, until the salad is rich, punchy and bright, bite after bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/25/dining/as-melon-and-avocado-salad/merlin_174968751_e630dbc8-5c70-441f-8ecb-b54018f592f5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "avocado, fennel seeds, lemon, melon, red pepper flakes, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 573}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons fennel seeds", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 lemon, for zesting and juicing", "1/2 medium cantaloupe or honeydew melon (about 2 1/2 pounds), seeds removed", "2 ripe avocados", "2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small skillet over medium-low, toast the fennel seeds and red-pepper flakes, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
