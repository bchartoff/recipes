{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meringue Mess With Rhubarb and Strawberries", "description": "There is a traditional English dessert called Eton Mess, attributed to Eton College, in which broken meringues, strawberries and softly whipped cream are folded together. \u201cMess\u201d in this context doesn\u2019t mean \u201cmessy,\u201d but rather \u201cmixture.\u201d This recipe is a springtime mess of rhubarb and strawberries. Feel free to substitute other berries or stone fruit as they come into season. It\u2019s an easy dish to put together, especially if you use store-bought meringues. Instructions are given here for making meringues, but it is a bit of a project and one that should not be attempted in humid weather because the meringues will not set properly. If you prefer a more refined version, spread meringues with whipped cream, spoon the fruit on top, and call it Pavlova.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/07/dining/07KITCHEN2/07KITCHEN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, pistachio, rhubarb, strawberry", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 94}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 399, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "42 milligrams", "sugarContent": "63 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 egg whites", "1 cup/200 grams sugar", "Or use 6 to 8 store-bought meringue shells", "3/4 pound/340 grams rhubarb, chopped (about 3 cups)", "1 cup/200 grams sugar, plus 2 tablespoons for cream", "1 1-inch-piece cinnamon stick", "6 cloves", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 teaspoon rose water, optional", "2 pints/1 pound/450 grams strawberries, hulled and halved or quartered", "3 tablespoons chopped pistachios", "Mint leaves for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the meringues: Heat oven to 200 degrees.
