{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sabudana Khichdi (Maharashtrian Tapioca Pilaf)", "description": "Sabudana khichdi, which loosely translates to \u201ctapioca mixture,\u201d is a delightfully chewy Maharashtrian pilaf studded with the crunch of toasted peanuts, creamy bits of potato, and the occasional cumin seed. A hit of sweetness is balanced with salt, lemon and the alternating flames of ginger and green chile, and then everything is showered with a generous amount of chopped cilantro. The result is seductive in both texture and flavor. The key to this simple dish is to thoroughly soak the sabudana, or medium-sized tapioca pearls, until you can easily smash one between your thumb and forefinger. Then, use a microwave to cook the sabudana, stopping to check for doneness in 15-second increments. As soon as the pearls are translucent and chewy, they\u2019re done.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/23/magazine/23mag-eat/23mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings as a side or 1 to 2 as a main", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cumin, ginger, peanut, potato, tapioca pearls, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 738}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup medium tapioca pearls (look for sabudana at an Indian grocer)", "3 or 4 small-medium yellow potatoes (about 8 ounces), such as Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn", "Fine sea salt", "1/2 cup raw peanuts", "4 to 5 Thai chiles, stems removed, roughly chopped", "1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch coins", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 to 2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 to 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place tapioca in a large bowl and cover with water.
