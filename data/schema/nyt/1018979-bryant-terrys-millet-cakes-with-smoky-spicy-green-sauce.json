With millet, lentils and potatoes, these vegan cakes are a nod to \u201970s-style macrobiotic dishes \u2014 but upgraded with a smoky, garlicky sauce built from roasted green peppers. They are also good on their own if you don\u2019t have time to make the sauce, and are delicious topped with an egg as a non-vegan alternative.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/dining/29VEGANS1-1511382927403/29VEGANS1-1511382927403-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "berbere spice blend, bourbon, millet, millet flour, panko, red lentils, kwanzaa, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 72}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 758, "unsaturatedFatContent": "46 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "62 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "754 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 dried Medjool date, pitted", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "Fine sea salt", "4 green bell peppers, roasted, peeled and seeded (see note)", "1 large jalape\u00f1o, roasted, peeled and seeded (see note)", "1/4 cup minced cilantro", "1 teaspoon bourbon", "Freshly ground white pepper", "2 tablespoons powdered flax seeds", "1 medium russet potato, scrubbed", "1/2 cup millet, rinsed", "Fine sea salt", "1/2 cup red lentils, sorted and rinsed", "2 tablespoons peanut or safflower oil, more for frying", "3/4 cup finely chopped yellow onion", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "1 3/4 teaspoons berbere spice blend (available at spice shops, online, and at large markets like Whole Foods)", "2 tablespoons millet flour", "1 1/2 cups panko (Japanese bread crumbs), drizzled with 1 tablespoon peanut or safflower oil and toasted in a hot pan until golden", "2 cups roasted red peppers, sliced, for garnish (optional; see Note for roasting instructions)", "1/2 medium head red leaf lettuce (about 1/4 pound), sliced into thin chiffonade, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Put the date in a small saucepan, add water to cover and bring to a boil.
