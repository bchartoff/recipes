{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Pizza", "description": "Neapolitan-style pizza is typically baked in ovens heated past 900 degrees to achieve its signature crackly, thin, charred crust with a moist, stretchy crumb. But you can easily yield similar textures and flavors at home by baking pizza dough directly on the grates of a hot grill until it\u2019s bubbly and crisp. Once the dough is baked, it can be topped and finished via indirect heat. Because grilled pizzas cook mainly from below, the cheese should be layered underneath dollops of hand-crushed tomatoes and toppings to get a good melt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
