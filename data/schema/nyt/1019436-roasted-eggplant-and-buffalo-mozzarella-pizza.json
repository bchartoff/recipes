{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Eggplant and Buffalo Mozzarella Pizza", "description": "In Italy, when high-quality buffalo mozzarella is used to top a pizza, it\u2019s often added after baking instead of before. The heat of the just-cooked pizza softens but doesn\u2019t melt the cheese, which retains its milky, sweet flavor and stays supple instead of becoming stretchy. Here, the cheese crowns a pizza topped with tomato, roasted eggplant, chile flakes and fresh basil leaves. If you can\u2019t get good buffalo mozzarella, substitute dollops of fresh ricotta. Or, you could experiment with burrata, draining it first. Save the cream, mix it with olive oil and salt, then use it to top ripe tomatoes instead of dressing. And if you are in a rush, substitute store-bought pizza dough.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/01/dining/01Apperex/merlin_141638667_cacfad71-c247-42b0-958d-74c0a60b1331-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT19H30M", "recipeYield": "4 12-inch pizzas", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "basil, buffalo mozzarella, eggplant, main course, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 122}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 857, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "128 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "12 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1323 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "1 3/4 cup/420 milliliters warm, not hot, water", "2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl", "4 1/2 cups/575 grams\u00a0all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2 pounds eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes (2 medium, or 1 large)", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed", "Kosher salt, as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "1/2 cup canned plum tomatoes, pur\u00e9ed", "4 to 8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced, to taste", "Red-pepper flakes, as needed", "8 ounces fresh buffalo mozzarella", "Basil leaves, torn into pieces", "Flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Mix the yeast, warm water and olive oil in the bowl of an electric stand mixer or food processor, and let the mixture sit until the yeast is foamy, about 5 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add in flour and salt, and using the dough hook or food processor blade, beat or pulse it\u00a0until a smooth, slightly elastic dough forms, 2 to 3 minutes.
