{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jessica B. Harris\u2019s Summer Succotash", "description": "The food historian and writer Jessica B. Harris wrote a whole cookbook, \u201cThe Martha\u2019s Vineyard Table\u201d (Chronicle Books, 2013), paying tribute to the Massachusetts resort island where lobsters, oysters and farm-fresh vegetables are abundant. This dish is ideal for summer, when the tomatoes are overflowing. Dr. Harris loves to use okra in the place of beans, which are often an ingredient in succotash dishes. If you can\u2019t find a habanero chile but still want to add heat, a small jalape\u00f1o will work.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nicole Taylor"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/22/dining/22COOKING-SOUTHERNSUCCOTASH2/22COOKING-SOUTHERNSUCCOTASH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "corn, habanero chile, okra, tomato, fourth of july, labor day, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 225}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 80, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "542 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound okra, tops and tails trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds", "6 large, ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped (about 3 1/2 pounds)", "2 cups freshly cut corn kernels (from about 2 medium ears)", "1 habanero chile, pricked with a fork (optional)", "Salt and ground black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine okra and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan.
