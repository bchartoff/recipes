{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Onion, Apple and Goat Cheese Melts", "description": "Caramelizing onions can be a lesson in patience, but you need to cook these onions for only half the usual time, just enough to break them down and turn them a light golden brown. Once cooked, they make up the bulk of the filling for these sandwiches. Folding the warm onions into the goat cheese softens the cheese, helping it glide easily over the bread. The cheese helps bind everything together, so nothing slips out while the sandwich is toasting in the pan. You can use apples or pears here; either adds some fresh crunch. Seasoned with woody thyme and zippy kalamata olives, this sandwich makes a hearty lunch, or a light supper paired with soup or salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/01/dining/jg-goat-chese-melts/merlin_180213324_66723c26-31e7-4910-875a-349507680bef-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, sandwiches, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "apple, goat cheese, kalamata olives, pear, sourdough, thyme, vidalia onion, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 606}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed for frying", "1 1/2 pounds Vidalia onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 cup soft goat cheese (about 4 ounces)", "2 tablespoons chopped pitted kalamata olives (about 10 olives)", "8 (1/2-inch-thick) slices sourdough bread", "1/2 pound apples or pears, halved, cored and thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium.
