They were lunch for her grandfather, or a soup course when the family gathered at her grandparent\u2019s house. The recipe, published in her memoir-cookbook hybrid \u201c<a href=\"https://lindaronstadt.com/book/feels-like-home/\">Feels Like Home: A Song for the Sonoran Borderlands</a>\u201d (Heyday, 2022), is different from many traditional alb\u00f3ndigas recipes, which use rice or soft vegetables like potatoes or carrots to bind the meatballs. It may seem like the meatball components won\u2019t come together when kneading at first, but stick with it. The poaching liquid becomes a broth, which benefits from skimming off the little bit of foam that appears before serving. A variation of the Ronstadt family meatballs first appeared in The Times in 1989.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/05/dining/03RONSTADTREX1-albondigas/merlin_213609858_a6b4bd3f-6659-48a8-8b7c-586dcd0daafb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings (about 65 meatballs)", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, meatballs, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, ground beef, lard, mint, olive oil, oregano, plum tomato, scallion, soup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 138}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds ground beef, preferably flank and round steak", "6 medium tomatoes, preferably plum", "1/2 cup fresh mint, finely chopped", "1/2 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped\u00a0", "1 medium scallion, minced", "1 small garlic clove, minced", "2 tablespoons dried Mexican oregano", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup olive oil or melted lard", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat your broiler.
