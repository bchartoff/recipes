{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crostini alla Norma", "description": "The classic Sicilian pasta sauce of eggplant and tomato makes a hearty topping for summery crostini. Traditionally, the alla norma method involves frying eggplant, but this recipe calls for roasting it, which saves time and requires much less oil. The eggplant and tomato mixture can be made up to two days in advance, which makes this a great dish for entertaining, since it benefits from some extra time for flavors to develop. For an even quicker appetizer, serve in a bowl with toasted baguette slices on the side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/07/dining/lh-crostini-alla-norma/merlin_158856483_d049e735-bf99-4843-8a07-166a2a360418-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "About 3 cups (about 36 crostini)", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, dips and spreads, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, basil, eggplant, onion, oregano, ricotta salata, tomato, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large baguette (about 18 inches), cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices", "5 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing", "1 1/2 pounds eggplant (about 1 large), cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste", "1 medium yellow onion, chopped", "2 garlic cloves, minced (about 2 teaspoons)", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 1/2 pounds medium tomatoes (about 4), cored, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 1/4 cups thinly sliced fresh basil", "2 teaspoons red wine vinegar", "3/4 cup shaved or grated ricotta salata cheese (about 2 ounces), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
