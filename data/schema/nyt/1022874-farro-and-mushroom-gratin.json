{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro and Mushroom Gratin", "description": "In this elegant gratin, nutty farro and earthy mushrooms are baked with herbs and mascarpone into a creamy casserole topped with Gruy\u00e8re. It\u2019s a rich, meatless meal that needs nothing more than a crisp green salad to round it out, though it\u2019s also a satisfying side dish alongside roast chicken or fish. You can prepare the entire gratin earlier in the day (leave it at room temperature), then bake it just before serving \u2014 simply add a little extra time to ensure that it emerges from the oven steaming hot through and through. Note that if you\u2019re using tangy cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche instead of mascarpone, you may not need the lemon. Taste before squeezing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/19/dining/14apperex/merlin_199987257_707af0b5-d669-453f-a246-037b0e803796-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 660}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 cups pearled or semi-pearled farro", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 pound mixed mushrooms (such as oyster, maitake, portobello, shiitake or cremini), cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "6 to 8 fresh thyme sprigs", "1 cup thinly sliced shallots, leeks or onion", "1 cup mascarpone or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 cup chopped parsley leaves and tender stems, chives, mint or cilantro", "8 ounces shredded Gruy\u00e8re (about 1 2/3 cups)", "Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
