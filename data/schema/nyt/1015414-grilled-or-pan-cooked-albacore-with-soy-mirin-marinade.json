{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled or Pan-Cooked Albacore With Soy/Mirin Marinade", "description": "If you\u2019re concerned about which fish are environmentally safe to eat, you can\u2019t do better than consulting the Web sites of the Monterey Bay Aquarium or the Environmental Defense Fund for their handy pocket guides for buying seafood (or choosing it in a restaurant). You won\u2019t break the bank buying fresh fish, but there can be a better selection of moderately priced varieties in the freezer department. Among my findings were albacore steaks, one of the few types of tuna that we can still enjoy with a clear conscience, and a great fish if you\u2019re trying to eat more omega-3s. This is a sweet/savory marinade that I also use for tofu. If you are concerned about the quantity of soy sauce, know that most of it stays behind in the bowl when you cook the fish. If you are using frozen albacore steaks, wait until they are partly thawed before marinating.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/albacore/albacore-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 100}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 251, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "651 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)", "1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon minced or grated fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon dark sesame oil", "1 1/2 pounds albacore steaks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, ginger and sugar in a bowl and whisk together well.
