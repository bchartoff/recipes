After \u201cthe incident,\u201d I wanted to leave Lisbon, but instead, my husband Michael and I decided to tackle our must-taste list. It was on our last day in Lisbon that we tasted the cake at Landeau Chocolate. It was intense, but not overwhelming; truly chocolate, but somehow each layer\u2019s chocolateness was different. I returned home and made this cake, my version of the cake that cured my pickpocket blues. It\u2019s a dense-but-not-heavy, brownielike cake topped with a whipped chocolate ganache (think: mousse) and a substantial dusting of cocoa. Because this cake is completely about the chocolate, choose one you love.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/03/magazine/03mag-eat/03mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch cake (about 10 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, semisweet chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2063}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into chunks, plus more for greasing the pan", "1/3 cup/30 grams unsweetened cocoa powder", "1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "5 ounces/140 grams semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs, chilled", "1 3/4 cups/420 milliliters heavy cream", "6 ounces/170 grams semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Center a rack in the oven, and heat oven to 325 degrees.
