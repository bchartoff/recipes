{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turducken", "description": "A well-prepared turducken is a marvelous treat, a free-form poultry terrine layered with flavorful stuffing and moistened with duck fat. When it's assembled, it looks like a turkey and it roasts like a turkey, but when you go to carve it, you can slice through it like a loaf of bread. In each slice you get a little bit of everything: white meat from the breast, dark meat from the legs, duck, carrots, bits of sausage, bread, herbs, juices and chicken, too.\n\nAlthough smoking turducken on my deck in Brooklyn was unlikely to happen, I would roast it in my oven. Turducken, it turns out, is not unlike preparing a turkey with stuffing, and not unlike cooking a rolled and tied butterflied leg of lamb. So that is just how I approached preparing it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/18/dining/18COOKING-TURDUCKEN/18COOKING-TURDUCKEN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "chicken, duck, turkey, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound pancetta, sliced 1/4-inch thick, then cut into 1/2-inch squares", "3/4 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage seasoned with fennel", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 cup chopped onions, plus 1 onion (halved) for pan", "1 cup chopped carrots, plus 2 carrots (halved crosswise) for pan", "1 1/2 cups chopped celery", "2 cloves garlic, smashed", "1 teaspoon fennel seed", "1 3- to 3 1/2-pound chicken, boned, giblets and wings reserved", "1 4- to 5-pound duck, boned, giblets and wings reserved", "Sea salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup brandy", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme", "2 cups dry baguette in 1/2-inch cubes", "1 10- to 12-pound turkey, boned, wings and legs left intact"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before serving, cook pancetta in large saut\u00e9 pan over low heat for 6 to 8 minutes, until fat is rendered and pancetta is browned.
