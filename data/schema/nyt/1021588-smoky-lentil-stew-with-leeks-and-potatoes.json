{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Lentil Stew With Leeks and Potatoes", "description": "Rustic with deep flavor, this stew improves after a day in the fridge. Make the whole recipe, and eat it over several days \u2014 or freeze it for later. If you can\u2019t get small Spanish Pardina lentils or French lentilles du Puy, use any size green or brown lentil. (Carnivores may want to add chorizo or jam\u00f3n.) The stew is rather brothy at first, but thickens upon sitting. Thin with a little water when reheating, as necessary. For optimum results, be sure to use fruity, zesty-tasting extra virgin olive oil \u2014 it really makes a difference.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/30/dining/30tanisrex1-stew/merlin_179039508_8384549d-9354-48f6-88ad-3f0139cf2820-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "green lentils, leek, make-ahead, paprika, potato, saffron, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 4020}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups small lentils, such as Pardina or Puy (12 ounces), or use any size green or brown lentil", "1 medium onion, halved, plus 2 bay leaves and 2 whole cloves", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 or 5 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced 3/4-inch thick", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "2 medium leeks, white and tender green parts, chopped in 1/2-inch pieces", "1 teaspoon chopped garlic", "1 large thyme or rosemary sprig", "2 tablespoons piment\u00f3n dulce or smoked sweet paprika", "1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne, or to taste", "Small pinch of saffron (about 12 strands), soaked in 1/4 cup cold water", "1 cup chopped canned tomato with juice", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "Chopped parsley (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse lentils.
