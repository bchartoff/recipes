Take care to serve these straight from the oven when they are still hot and a little gooey in the center. If you want to make these ahead, you can freeze them after forming them into balls, but before baking (it\u2019s easiest to freeze them directly on the baking sheet if you\u2019ve got the freezer space). Then bake them while still frozen, adding a few minutes onto the baking time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/13/dining/13appetite1/merlin_130869134_f68d73ff-e9d4-4c95-ae44-6d800c828c39-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "5 1/2 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, gruy\u00e8re, parmesan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 423}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 30, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "30 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1 cup/136 grams bread flour", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "5\u00a0ounces/142 grams shredded\u00a0Gruy\u00e8re", "1/3\u00a0cup/50 grams grated\u00a0Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees, and line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup water, butter, salt and cayenne to a boil.
