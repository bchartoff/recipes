{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef and Broccoli", "description": "Here is a streamlined, powerfully flavorful recipe for a delivery-food standby: velvety wok-fried beef in a oyster-soy sauce, served in a forest of green. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s diaspora food,\u2019\u2019 the chef Jonathan Wu told me, describing the cooking of Chinese immigrants to the United States and a dish that is almost unknown in China but beloved in America. The recipe is a version of the one Wu\u2019s mother made for dinner when he was growing up outside Hartford, Conn., with a little chile-garlic paste added for zip and, thanks to the Brooklyn chef Dale Talde, a pat of butter swirled into the sauce at the end. This provides a plush gloss that is far better than the traditional cornstarch slurry. It is midweek family cooking at its best.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/08/magazine/08mag-eat1/08mag-eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "beef, broccoli, oyster sauce, rice wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1765}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 404, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "35 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1429 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup Shaoxing rice wine, dry sherry or sake", "3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "1 pound beef \u2014 chuck or rib steak \u2014 sliced thin against the grain", "1/4 cup oyster sauce", "1/2 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce, or to taste", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon neutral oil, like canola, grapeseed or peanut", "1 pound broccoli, the head cut into florets and the stems peeled and cut into planks", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the wine, 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce and the cornstarch.
