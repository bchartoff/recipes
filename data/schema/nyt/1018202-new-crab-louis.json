{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "New Crab Louis", "description": "Crab Louis is a rather perfect meal for a summer night, particularly in this slimmed down, very homemade, ketchup-less version. With nothing processed or sweetened, an updated Crab Louis is simply good American crab, Little Gem- or Boston Bibb-lettuce, and pickle- and caper-studded mayonnaise whisked from olive oil and the best, richest-yolked eggs you can find. The effect is as straightforward as the original's, but the details are resolutely contemporary.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/03/magazine/03eat/03mag-03eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "capers, crab, dill pickles, English cucumber, Little Gems lettuce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 82}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 266, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "1060 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3-4 heads Little Gems lettuce (or 2 heads Boston lettuce or 1 head iceberg)", "1 (12-ounce) English cucumber, halved lengthwise and seeded", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste", "3 tablespoons sherry or white distilled vinegar", "5 eggs at room temperature", "1/4 teaspoon smooth Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1 cup not sharp, good-tasting extra-virgin olive oil like Frantoia or California Olive Ranch", "A few drops room-temperature water", "1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot (about 1/2 shallot)", "1 stalk green garlic, light and whitest green parts only, or 1/2 clove regular garlic, peeled and chopped", "2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped very dilly dill pickles", "1/2 tablespoon chopped drained capers", "1 pound picked-through jumbo lump crab meat (canned is fine), chilled", "Homemade vinegar-based hot sauce or Tabasco", "Chives or chive blossoms", "Optional: Finishing salt, like Maldon", "Optional: An avocado; other vegetables, like boiled asparagus or potatoes, or wedged tomato"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the lettuce, and dry in a salad spinner and on dish towels.
