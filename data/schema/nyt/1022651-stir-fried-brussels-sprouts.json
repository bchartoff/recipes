{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Brussels Sprouts", "description": "Brussels sprouts caramelize to a deep, delicious brown while retaining a fresh bite in minutes when cooked on the stovetop. In this adaptation of wok stir-frying, the sprouts quickly sear in a single layer in a skillet, then steam through with a splash of water to tenderize their tough cores. Crushed garlic cloves release their aroma into the hot oil, but are in chunks big enough to not burn and get bitter. A final sprinkle of sugar, soy sauce and red-pepper flakes give the sprouts a nice balance of sweet, salty and spicy. You can eat this with other stir-fries and steamed rice or alongside any main dish. Leftovers, reheated or cold, can be tossed into grain bowls and salads.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/20/dining/15korex-stir-fried-brussels-sprouts/merlin_195933828_9d0589fd-20f4-442d-b179-fbefb14d862a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, garlic, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1105}, "recipeIngredient": ["Neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola oil", "4 garlic cloves, smashed, then peeled", "1 pound brussels sprouts, halved or quartered, if large", "Salt and pepper", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "Red-pepper flakes, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large skillet over high for a few minutes.
