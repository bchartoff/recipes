{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smash Burgers", "description": "This is the traditional, griddled hamburger of diners and takeaway spots, smashed thin and cooked crisp on its edges. It is best to cook in a heavy, cast-iron skillet slicked with oil or fat, and not on a grill. For meat, ask a butcher for coarse-ground chuck steak, with at least a 20 percent fat content, or grind your own. Keep it in the refrigerator until you are ready to cook, and try not to handle it with your fingers \u2014 use an ice-cream scoop or spoon instead. Plop down a few ounces in the pan, smash it with a spatula, salt it, let it go crisp and flip. Add cheese and get your bun toasted. The process moves quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/14/multimedia/sifton-hamburgers/sifton-hamburgers-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, burgers, main course", "keywords": "cast iron, ground beef, skillet", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1867}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon neutral oil, like canola, or a pat of unsalted butter", "2 pounds ground chuck, at least 20 percent fat", "Kosher salt and black pepper to taste", "8 slices cheese (optional)", "8 soft hamburger buns, lightly toasted", "Lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes and condiments, as desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add oil or butter to a large cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet and place over medium heat.
