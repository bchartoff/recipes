{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro Salad With Tomatoes and Romano Beans", "description": "If you are unfamiliar with farro, here\u2019s a primer: Farro is a whole wheat berry with a complex, nutty taste and a hearty texture. In cooking you can use it interchangeably with spelt or wheat berries, though farro is sometimes softer than spelt or wheat berries when cooked. Cook the grains in at least 3 times their volume of salted water or stock for 50 minutes, or until some of the grains begin to splay. Turn off the heat and allow to sit for 15 to 30 minutes, then drain. A cup of uncooked farro will yield three cups cooked.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/20/dining/farrosalad/farrosalad-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "dairy-free, healthy, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, farro, romano beans, tomato, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 83}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 188, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "416 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups cooked farro", "3/4 pound tomatoes, diced, or cherry tomatoes, cut in half", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "2 tablespoons cider vinegar or sherry vinegar", "1 to 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard (to taste)", "1 small garlic clove, minced or pur\u00e9ed", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 pound romano beans, trimmed and cut in 2-inch lengths", "2 to 4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or parsley, or a combination", "2 ounces goat cheese, crumbed (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl combine the farro and tomatoes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together the lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil.
