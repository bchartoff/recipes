{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Sriracha Wings With Cucumber Sour Cream", "description": "Everyone knows that the best chicken wings have crisp skin and tender meat, but achieving that perfect balance can be a challenge. In this recipe, which is adapted from Taku, a Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn, the uncooked wings are brined overnight in a combination of yuzu juice and salt, then fried for a good 15 minutes. The result? Surprisingly crisp skin and juicy, flavorful meat. Once fried, they're tossed with a spicy sambal-Sriracha sauce, then served with a cooling cucumber-sour cream dip alongside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jill Santopietro"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/28/dining/Fried-Sambal-Wings/Fried-Sambal-Wings-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, poultry", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken, cucumber, sour cream, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 37}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 965, "unsaturatedFatContent": "67 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "93 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "951 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup yuzu juice (see Tip)", "1/2 cup kosher salt, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons sugar", "18 chicken wings, about 3 * pounds, wing tips removed, each wing cut in half", "6 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup sambal", "1/4 cup Sriracha hot sauce", "1 tablespoon rice-wine vinegar", "1/2 English cucumber, quartered lengthwise and seeded", "1 4-inch piece ginger", "1 cup sour cream", "1 quart vegetable oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the brine by combining the yuzu juice, 1/2 cup salt, sugar and 2 quarts water in a container large enough to hold the wings.
