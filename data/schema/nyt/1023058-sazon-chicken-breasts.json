It definitely stands up as a main course, but leftovers make for great additions to salads and tacos. The breasts benefit from an overnight marinade, which will make the meat juicier and more flavorful, but the dish can come together in 45 minutes if you\u2019re short on time. This recipe also works great with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Because they\u2019re often thinner and fattier, they may cook a little more quickly than breasts.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/11/dining/VD-Sazon-chicken-Breasts/merlin_204710106_2a1a3e72-d286-4f74-a261-b4441fb40bcc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, healthy", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 199}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 cup fresh orange juice, from 2 small oranges (preferably mandarin)", "2 tablespoons olive oil\u00a0", "2 tablespoons homemade or store-bought basic <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022006-sazon\">saz\u00f3n seasoning</a>", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper\u00a0", "4 medium boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 \u00bd pounds), trimmed of excess fat\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small food processor, combine the garlic, orange juice, olive oil, saz\u00f3n, salt and pepper; pulse until it forms a creamy marinade.

Add marinated chicken breasts, one by one, and pour over about half the marinade. Cook for 7 to 10 minutes, flipping frequently with tongs and being careful not to let them get too dark too fast. Reduce heat to low and cook for another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the breast, flipping often to ensure meat is cooked through. Thinner chicken breasts will take less time to cook, so monitor the color and texture of your meat as it cooks. Check doneness by pressing the center with your tongs. If the center is still squishy, continue to cook until meat has a bit of resistance (though not rock hard), and registers 165 degrees on a meat thermometer.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Let rest in the pan off-heat for a few minutes.
