{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Beef Stew With Maple and Stout", "description": "This savory-sweet stew is delightfully hands-off \u2014 no saut\u00e9ing, searing or simmering. The key is the timing: Cook the beef first and add the vegetables later to ensure that the meat tenderizes while the vegetables retain some bite. Real maple syrup gives the dish a sweetness that pairs well with the mild bitterness of stout beer. Carrots, potatoes and parsnips are classic stew vegetables, but rutabaga or celery root work well, too. A squeeze of lemon at the end brightens the flavors of this cold-weather dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/12/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-maple-stout-beef-stew/sd-pressure-cooker-maple-stout-beef-stew-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "Balsamic Vinegar, Chuck Roast, Clove, Maple Syrup, Stout Beer, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 221}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 538, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1246 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds beef chuck roast, excess fat trimmed, meat cut into 2-inch pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "3 thyme sprigs", "2 rosemary sprigs", "1 cup beef broth (or 1 1/4 cups if using an 8-quart pot)", "3/4 cup stout beer (or 1 cup if using an 8-quart pot)", "1/4 cup real maple syrup, preferably dark", "4 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, preferably aged", "3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "2 parsnips, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "2 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the beef to a 6- to 8-quart pressure cooker, season it generously with salt and pepper and toss it with the flour until evenly coated.
