It cooks over a lower-than-usual temperature, which maintains moisture while still browning, thanks to the sugars in the tomato paste. The burgers are assembled with tomato and arugula for freshness, and they wouldn\u2019t properly nod to chicken Parm without a blanket of gooey, sweet mozzarella.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/as-chicken-parm-burgers/as-chicken-parm-burgers-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, burgers, poultry, main course", "keywords": "ground chicken, mozzarella", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 360}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 pound ground chicken or turkey", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup chopped basil or parsley leaves", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "4 (1/4-inch-thick) slices from a large ripe tomato", "1/2 cup grated fresh or low-moisture mozzarella", "4 burger buns or ciabatta rolls", "Arugula, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly grease a large plate with oil and set aside.
