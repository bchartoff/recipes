This one is summery, with a zesty, garlicky herb pesto, ideal for grilling over coals. It is delicious served at room temperature for an elegant summer buffet. Ask your butcher for a nice center-cut piece of tenderloin. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with butterflying the meat yourself, ask the butcher to do that too, but it\u2019s really not very difficult.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/14/dining/14KITCHEN1/14KITCHEN1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, roasts", "keywords": "basil, beef tenderloin, olives, parsley, pecorino romano, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 151}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 517, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "564 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pound center-cut beef tenderloin, trimmed of fat", "Salt and pepper", "2 cups Italian parsley leaves", "4 cups basil leaves", "4 garlic cloves, grated or finely minced", "1 cup pitted green olives", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little more for drizzling", "4 ounces grated pecorino romano (1 cup)", "1 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position the meat on a cutting board so it is perpendicular to the board.
