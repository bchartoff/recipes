{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Crispy Aromatic Duck", "description": "This recipe came to The Times from the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who served it at 66 in New York. It takes a little unattended prep time and commitment, but the results are tender and fragrant and practically fall off the bone. The duck marinates in a spice rub in the fridge overnight, and then is steamed, quartered and fried. Serve it with Chinese pancakes, hoisin sauce and scallions.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Reynolds"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "duck, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["16-pound duck", "2/3 cup kosher salt", "1/4 cup black peppercorns", "5 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns", "3 tablespoons cumin seeds", "2 tablespoons five-spice powder", "63-by- 1/8-inch slices peeled fresh ginger root", "12 scallions, 6 cut into 3-inch lengths, 6 finely shredded", "Flour for dusting", "1 to 2 cups peanut oil", "Chinese mandarin pancakes (see note)", "Hoisin sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse and dry the duck.
