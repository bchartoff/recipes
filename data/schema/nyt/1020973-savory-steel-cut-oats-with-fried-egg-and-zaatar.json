{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Savory Steel-Cut Oats With Fried Egg and Za\u2019atar", "description": "Oat porridge for breakfast is often topped with brown sugar and cream. Though sweetened porridge is delicious, a savory approach with oats makes a nice change. Think of oats as a fine substitute for rice \u2014 you don\u2019t always want rice pudding, do you? Steel-cut oats have a nutty whole-grain flavor and retain a nubbly texture, far superior to rolled oats; they pair nicely with savory toppings, for a risotto-like effect. This easy, hearty dish is actually suitable for any time of day, not just morning. If you can\u2019t find za\u2019atar (a splendid spice mix of wild thyme, sumac and sesame used throughout the Middle East), try a sprinkling of toasted ground cumin or a pinch of oregano, or a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. It\u2019s hard to cook a single portion of oats, so make the full batch. Leftovers can be reheated for another day\u2019s breakfast. (And if rolled oats is all you have, it\u2019s no crime.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/dining/03Tanisrex1-oats/merlin_171108087_2797a7cc-dd77-45dc-8bfc-8b892db8c651-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, grains and rice", "keywords": "egg, steel-cut oats, za\u2019atar, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup steel-cut oats (pinhead, not rolled)", "Salt", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large egg", "A few strips of roasted red pepper (jarred is fine)", "1 teaspoon chopped scallion", "Red-pepper flakes", "Za\u2019atar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Boil 3 cups water in a small saucepan.
