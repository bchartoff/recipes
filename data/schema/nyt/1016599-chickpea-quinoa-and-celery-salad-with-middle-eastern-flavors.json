{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chickpea, Quinoa and Celery Salad With Middle Eastern Flavors", "description": "It\u2019s the sumac (available in Middle Eastern markets) and the herbs \u2013 dill, mint, chives \u2013 that give this salad its Middle Eastern accents. I love the texture and flavor of the chickpeas, which make for a substantial and comforting dish. It\u2019s all you need for lunch and makes a delicious light supper. I love abundant, thinly sliced celery in just about any lemony salad; you will appreciate it for its texture as well as its flavor.  Of course, you can use canned chickpeas, but if you have the time, try cooking some dried chickpeas to see how good they taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/24/science/24recipehealthalt/24recipehealthalt-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 147}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 318, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "490 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas (1 15-ounce can, drained and rinsed)", "1 1/2 cups cooked quinoa (any color)", "1 cup thinly sliced celery", "3/4 cup chopped tomatoes", "1 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint", "1 tablespoons minced chives", "2 to 4 tablespoons chopped white or red onion, soaked for 5 minutes in cold water and drained (optional)", "1 teaspoon sumac, plus additional for sprinkling", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "2 teaspoons sherry vinegar or white wine vinegar", "Salt to taste", "1 small garlic clove, minced or pureed", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a salad bowl, combine chickpeas, quinoa, celery, tomatoes, dill, mint, chives, onion and sumac and toss together."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl or measuring cup whisk together lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and garlic.
