{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Fish With Chard and Spicy Red-Pepper Relish", "description": "A relish of sweet red peppers, tomatoes, onions and habanero chile, serves as both a marinade and a dressing in this recipe. Its distinct taste is reminiscent of an essential Nigerian stew known in Yoruba as ob\u00e8\u0329 ata and used as a base sauce for braising meats or leafy greens, simmering seafood and ladling over cooked starches. This recipe combines the piquant, fiery relish with a tender white fish and leafy greens for an easy sheet-pan meal. A high-temperature broil in the oven will leave you with a delicious char across the pan, and a cilantro-lime finish adds a layer of brightness to the generous variety of flavors. Make the relish up to a week ahead and marinate the fillets overnight if you can.
