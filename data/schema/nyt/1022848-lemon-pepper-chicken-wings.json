{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lemon-Pepper Chicken Wings", "description": "Lemon pepper usually refers to a store-bought spice blend of dehydrated lemon zest, black pepper and other seasonings, but the beloved pantry staple is simple enough to recreate at home: Rub oven-dried lemon zest into fresh, coarsely ground black pepper to release the oils of each. Magic ensues as the lemon gains the fruity muskiness of the pepper, and the pepper is slicked with the fragrant balm of the lemon. The citric acid is optional, but provides lemon pepper\u2019s characteristic tartness. Sprinkled over roasted chicken wings, this golden dust gives off high-voltage flavors. To make this with store-bought lemon pepper, skip Steps 3 and 4 and simply toss the roasted wings with a dusting of the seasoning to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/16/magazine/16mag-eat-site/16mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, poultry, appetizer", "keywords": "black pepper, chicken wings, lemon zest, super bowl, tailgate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 565}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds chicken wings, whole or separated into wingettes and drumettes", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 lemons", "2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 packed teaspoon dark brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/4 teaspoon citric acid (optional; see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chicken wings: Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
