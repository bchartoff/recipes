{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fastest Roast Turkey", "description": "Here is a turkey for when time and oven space are at a premium. The bird is butchered before cooking, its backbone removed (a technique called spatchcocking) and its legs separated, increasing the amount of surface area exposed to the oven's heat and decreasing the amount of cooking time dramatically. The overall height of the turkey also comes down, so two turkeys may fit in the oven, or one turkey and a baking pan filled with dressing. As with a whole bird, you should tent the meat with foil when it has finished cooking, and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/20/multimedia/thanksgiving-fast-turkey/thanksgiving-fast-turkey-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 or more servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "main course, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 327}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 633, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "87 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "1374 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 12- to 18-pound turkey, thawed, with giblets and neck removed", "1 medium onion, peeled and quartered", "2 stalks celery, cleaned and roughly chopped", "Fresh herbs to taste - thyme, sage, and rosemary all work well (optional)", "3 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 1/2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened and cut into small pats"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
