{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Farro Salad With Beets, Greens and Feta", "description": "Farro is a sturdy grain that stands up well to formidable ingredients like beets, their greens and salty feta cheese. That hardiness and versatility, as well as its sweet, nutty flavor, have made farro a popular option for filling out a salad in order to create a main dish. If you\u2019re in doubt, sliced or shredded poached or roasted chicken would make a nice addition. Either way the farro absorbs color from the red beets, giving the dish a pinkish tint that only deepens as hours pass. (In fact, you can make the dish up to a day ahead. And it travels well, making it fine picnic fare.) Soak the grains for an hour before cooking, and be sure to cook until tender, or else the salad will be chewy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/dining/mrs-farro-salad-with-beets-greens-feta/mrs-farro-salad-with-beets-greens-feta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday", "keywords": "healthy, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 689}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 214, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "141 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium or 3 small beets (any color) with greens, the beets roasted, the greens stemmed and washed in two changes of water", "1 cup farro, soaked for one hour in water to cover and drained", "Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste", "2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "1 small garlic clove, minced or pureed", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil (may substitute 1 to 2 tablespoons walnut oil for 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil)", "1/2 cup broken walnut pieces", "2 ounces feta or goat cheese, crumbled (more if desired for garnish)", "1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, tarragon, marjoram, chives, mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a medium saucepan.
