{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chess Pie Squares", "description": "These heavenly little bars, adapted from the Southern cookbook author Julia Reed, are a modern-day, perfect-for-a-picnic version of a traditional custard pie made from flour, cornmeal, sugar, eggs, butter and buttermilk. They are like lemon bars without the lip-puckering citrus: a blanket of egg-rich custard generously laced with vanilla atop a lightly salted, crumbly shortbread crust.\n\n(If you don't have buttermilk, you can make an easy substitute by combining one tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice with a cup of milk. Let stand for 5 minutes, then measure out 3/4 cup.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/dining/25COOKING-CHESS-PIE-SQUARE1/25COOKING-CHESS-PIE-SQUARE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "24 squares", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "butter, eggs, white cornmeal, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 128}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 218, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "77 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/240 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/57 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 ounces/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened", "6 ounces/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups/297 grams granulated sugar", "6 large egg yolks", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "3/4 cup/168 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons fine white or yellow cornmeal", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the shortbread crust: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar and salt.
