{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown Rice and Barley Salad with Sprouted Red Lentils and Green Beans", "description": "This hearty salad, dressed with a creamy, spicy dressing, can be made with a number of different grains.\n\nI\u2019ve been making iterations of this hearty whole grain salad tossed with a creamy, curry-spiced dressing since my earliest days of vegetarian cooking. My choice of grains for this version was a function of what I found in my pantry and my refrigerator:  -- enough brown rice and barley to combine for a salad but not enough for a more substantial dish. Farro or spelt would also work. The split red lentils, soaked just long enough to soften and begin to sprout, contribute color and texture along with their grassy flavor. Tossing the grains with lemon juice while they\u2019re still warm intensifies the flavors in the salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/02/science/05recipehealth/05recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, fall, summer, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 27}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 249, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "266 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup barley", "Salt to taste", "1/2 cup brown rice (short or long -grain)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon mayonnaise", "1/4 cup plain yogurt", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "1/2 teaspoon lightly toasted cumin seeds, ground", "1/4 teaspoon mild chili powder", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Salt to taste", "1/4 cup grapeseed oil", "2 tablespoons split red lentils, soaked for 2 hours or longer in water to cover and drained (1/4 cup soaked)", "1 cup diced European or Japanese cucumber", "3 ounces green beans, blanched for 4 minutes and cut in 1-inch lengths (about 1/2 cup)", "1 small green pepper, either sweet or hot, cut in small dice", "1/4 cup raisins or finely diced plums or pluots", "2 tablespoons chopped chives", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "2 teaspoons nigella seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To cook barley, bring 1 quart water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan, add salt to taste and barley.
