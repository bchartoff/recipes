{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cherimoya Parfait", "description": "Cherimoyas, also known as custard apples and sometimes as sweetsops, can be used the same way as such fruits as peaches, berries, plums and nectarines. Pureed, they are delicious in mousses, sorbets, ice creams, tarts, and custards. But they do not take well to cooking; their sweetness seems to dissipate with the heat.\n\nWhen purchasing cherimoyas, look for slightly soft, dull-green fruit that is beginning to brown, but avoid those that are bruised and mushy. To ripen, keep at room temperature for a few days, then refrigerate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Marian Burros"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "south american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cherimoya, heavy cream, sour cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 298, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "38 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup heavy cream", "1 cup sour cream", "2 tablespoons orange juice", "2 teaspoons lemon juice", "4 teaspoons grated orange rind", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla", "1/4 cup sugar", "1/2 cup cherimoya puree", "2 cups cherimoya chunks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Beat the heavy cream with the sour cream to a froth.
