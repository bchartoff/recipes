The squash was seasoned with allspice, cardamom, and orange peel, among other things, and I was inspired to try these seasonings in a soup. I tied the spices, herbs and orange peel into a cheesecloth bag and simmered them in the soup to great effect. The essence of orange is especially appealing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/10/science/recipehealthcarrot/recipehealthcarrot-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 69}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 197, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1191 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 allspice berries", "4 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed", "2 bay leaves", "2 thyme sprigs", "10 peppercorns", "Strips of zest from 1 orange", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "1/2 pound carrots, diced", "2 pounds peeled winter squash, such as butternut or kabocha", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "6 cups water, chicken stock or vegetable stock", "1 medium potato (about 5 ounces)", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1/2 cup fresh orange juice or additional stock or water", "Cayenne to taste", "1/4 cup cooked black quinoa", "1 tablespoon toasted pistachio oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut a square piece of cheesecloth to make a bag for spices, herbs and orange peel.
