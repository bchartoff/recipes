{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gingerbread Cheesecake", "description": "The warm, spicy flavors of gingerbread are a natural match for cheesecake. I mean, who doesn\u2019t love a slice of gingerbread cake slathered with cream cheese frosting? This dessert is certainly rich, but it is also packed with lots of spices, including a hefty sprinkle of both ground and fresh ginger, classic cinnamon, allspice that lends a slightly peppery note, and a bit of fresh lemon zest to brighten things up. It can be a little tricky to get the batter completely smooth, so make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature before you start mixing, and take care to bake the cheesecake gently to avoid cracks.\nThe cranberry topping here is optional but it is festive and delicious, and a great little cover-up if the cheesecake does happen to crack. Alternatively, this is great with a bit of lightly sweetened whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Slice cheesecake with a clean, hot knife for the tidiest servings.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/11/dining/11COOKING-GINGERBREADCHEESECAKE2/11COOKING-GINGERBREADCHEESECAKE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "9-inch cheesecake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, custards and puddings", "keywords": "dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 56}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/210 grams finely ground gingersnap cookie crumbs", "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "pinch kosher salt", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "2 pounds/904 grams cream cheese", "2/3 cup/146 grams dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon ground ginger", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "4 large eggs, lightly beaten", "3/4 cup/170 grams sour cream", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap)", "2 tablespoons dark rum", "2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "2 cups/200 grams fresh or frozen cranberries", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters orange juice", "2 tablespoons dark rum\u00a0", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon chopped crystallized ginger\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring the cream cheese, sour cream and eggs to room temperature."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
