{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Curried Waldorf Salad", "description": "Try this version this year instead of the traditional Thanksgiving salad. The original Waldorf salad combined celery, apples, and mayonnaise. Gradually walnuts and raisins were added to the mix. This version is not made with the gloppy mayonnaise we associate with Waldorf salad, but it has the same sweet, savory and crunchy mixture of celery, apples, raisins, and walnuts. Slice the apples and celery thin for a more elegant salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/11/13/health/nutrition/13recipe.health.ready/13recipe.health.ready-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 124}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 123, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "290 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt", "3/4 teaspoon curry powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "Salt to taste", "2 fuji apples", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice", "1/3 cup lightly toasted walnut halves", "1 cup thinly sliced celery, from the heart of the celery", "1/4 cup raisins", "1/4 cup celery leaves or flat-leaf parsley (or 2 tablespoons each), coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix together the lemon juice, yogurt, mayonnaise, curry powder, cumin, and salt.
