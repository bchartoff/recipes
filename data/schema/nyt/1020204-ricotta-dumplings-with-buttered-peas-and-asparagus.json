This recipe doesn\u2019t require you to drain the ricotta, but if you notice that yours is especially wet, you may want to add a tablespoon or two more of flour to make sure the dough stays together. It should be like a very wet biscuit dough (and not pourable or soupy). As for the vegetables, this dish is a truly excellent canvas for anything seasonal (asparagus and peas in the spring, cherry tomatoes in the summer, mushrooms in the fall, squash in the winter), so adjust as you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/dining/06romanrex/merlin_154236198_f306e3c5-29e4-4efd-b2ca-602531730222-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "asparagus, pea shoots, peas, ricotta, main course, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1079}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups whole-milk ricotta", "2 large eggs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 large leek, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced", "1 bunch asparagus, woody ends removed, cut into 2-inch pieces", "2 cups shelled fresh or frozen peas", "3 cups pea shoots or leaves, thick stems removed", "1/4 cup parsley or mint leaves, for serving", "Parmesan or pecorino, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine ricotta and eggs in a large bowl.
