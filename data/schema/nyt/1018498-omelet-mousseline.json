{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Omelet Mousseline", "description": "This omelet is fluffier and lighter than the classic. It uses Auguste Escoffier\u2019s technique: whipping the egg whites and then gently folding in the yolks. A small amount of heavy cream enriches the omelet, making it a good candidate for a final sprinkle of powdered sugar \u2013 or a jam filling. Served sweet or savory, it\u2019s an ethereal dish that truly melts in the mouth.
