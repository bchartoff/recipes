It is simple to make, and results in crackly-soft flatbreads singed by heat and yielding to tenderness within, with a faint tang of yogurt. It is exactly the sort of thing you\u2019d love to dip in a pool of curry again and again. Just set up an assembly line to roll out the dough and cook it in a hot pan. Once you make the recipe two or three times you\u2019ll never buy naan again.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/magazine/18eat2/18mag-18eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "flour, yogurt, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 756}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 392, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "331 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups all-purpose flour, or 500 grams", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola, plus a teaspoon more", "4 tablespoons whole-milk yogurt", "1 packet of active dried yeast, or 7 grams", "2 teaspoons sugar", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 level teaspoon baking powder", "1 cup whole milk, warmed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the flour into a large mixing bowl.
