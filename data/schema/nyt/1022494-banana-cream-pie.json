{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Banana Cream Pie", "description": "Floral honey, aromatic cardamom and a whipped cream bursting with banana goodness bolster the flavors of this classic dessert. The addition of freeze-dried bananas to the cream layer intensifies the taste of the fruit in each bite. This pie is a bit of a project, so break up the process to make it easier: Make the caramel up to one month in advance; bake the crust up to three days ahead; and fill the crust 24 hours before serving. The topping is best when added just before slicing, as the caramel will begin to weep and melt rapidly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sohla El-Waylly"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/03/dining/SE-banana-cream-pie/SE-banana-cream-pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H15M", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, project, dessert", "keywords": "banana, heavy cream, vanilla wafer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 315}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/80 grams mild honey", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons heavy cream", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "8 3/4 ounces/250 grams vanilla wafers (3 to 4 cups)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "4 tablespoons/56 grams unsalted butter, softened or melted", "1 tablespoon heavy cream", "5 green cardamom pods", "3 to 4 ripe medium bananas (555 grams)", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/30 grams cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 large egg", "2 large egg yolks", "2 cups/480 grams whole milk", "2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1/2 heaping cup/30 grams freeze-dried bananas", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 3/4 cups/400 grams heavy cream", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "Dark chocolate bar, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the caramel: Heat a small, heavy saucepan over medium.
