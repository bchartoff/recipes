{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butterscotch Blondies", "description": "These rich, chewy bars get their deep caramel flavor from a combination of brown butter, dark brown sugar and an optional sprinkle of flaky salt on top. They're delicious as is, but feel free to add some mix-ins (see note), if that\u2019s more your style. You'll want to keep the amount of extra ingredients, like nuts, chocolate and dried fruits, to 2 cups total, since blondies with a lot of mix-ins may take a few minutes longer to bake. For an especially delicious combination, try a mix of 1 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate or chips, 1/2 cup toasted walnuts and 1/2 cup chopped pitted dates.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/11/dining/11COOKING-BUTTERSCOTCHBLONDIE2/11COOKING-BUTTERSCOTCHBLONDIE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, quick breads", "keywords": "dark brown sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 307}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/227 grams unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 1/2 cups/330 grams dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 large eggs", "1 3/4 cups/224 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "Any mix-ins you like (see note)", "1/4 teaspoon flaky salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and butter and line a 9-by-9-inch baking dish with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
