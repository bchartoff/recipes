{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Vesuvio", "description": "No one really knows who invented chicken Vesuvio, a roast chicken and potato dish in white wine sauce named after Mount Vesuvius, the volcano in Campania, Italy. Some believe the dish first appeared on the menu at Vesuvio, a well-known Chicago restaurant in the 1930s; others believe it\u2019s a riff on the roast chicken dishes that grandmothers in Southern Italy have been making for hundreds of years. (The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.) Whatever its origins, Chicagoans claim it as their own, and you can find it at almost every Italian-American restaurant in the Windy City. The dish always includes plenty of oregano and lemon juice, and usually a scattering of fresh or frozen peas for color. We reached out to La Scarola, one of the most popular Italian-American restaurants in Chicago, for their recipe, and then we adapted it for home cooks. Serve it with plenty of crusty bread, for sopping up the mouthwatering sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/dining/ml-chicken-vesuvio-horizontal/ml-chicken-vesuvio-horizontal-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight", "keywords": "chicken, green peas, lemon, parsley, russet potatoes, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 993}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large russet potatoes (about 2 1/4 pounds), scrubbed, halved lengthwise, then into long 1-inch-wide wedges", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano", "3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 8 thighs)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 slices", "6 to 8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 1/4 cups chicken stock", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "1 cup fresh or frozen green peas", "1/2 lemon, juiced", "Chopped Italian parsley, for serving", "Crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
