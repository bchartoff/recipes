{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grits and Greens", "description": "This weeknight dinner is the perfect homey and rustic dish. Quick-cooking grits become extra flavorful because they are simmered in vegetable stock and get a creamy bite from the combination of milk and sharp Cheddar that\u2019s stirred in once the grits are tender. Using both collard greens and Swiss chard lends more interesting and varied tastes and textures. Because the leaves are cooked just until wilted, apple cider vinegar is added at the end to help balance out any bitterness. A little hot sauce splashed on just before serving helps tie the entire dish together, awakening the flavors in both the greens and grits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/28/dining/VL-greens-and-grits/merlin_200484291_55944f3e-2a72-46da-9bca-6198f7156975-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cheddar, collard greens, grits, swiss chard, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 614}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups vegetable stock", "1 cup quick-cooking grits", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 cup whole milk", "1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar (3 ounces)", "Salt", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 shallot, minced", "2 garlic cloves, sliced", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1 bunch collard greens (12 \u00bd ounces), stems removed, leaves cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 bunch Swiss chard (10 ounces), leaves and stems cut into 1-inch pieces", "Salt and black pepper", "1 cup vegetable stock", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "Hot sauce, to serve"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the grits: In a medium saucepan, heat the vegetable stock and 2 cups water over medium-high until boiling.
