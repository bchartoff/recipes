{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lamb Shanks With Apricots and Chickpeas", "description": "This stew, inspired by Moroccan tagines, is meant for lamb shanks, but lamb shoulder, cut in large chunks, would also work. As with most braises, this one improves after a night in the fridge, giving the flavors time to meld and deepen. You could even make it a few days before serving. The subtle commingling of onion, saffron and apricots is enchanting. Take the time to soak and cook dried chickpeas, if you can. Using canned is easier, but freshly cooked chickpeas taste far better (and their drained cooking liquid makes a delicious vegetarian broth).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/03/dining/29tanisrex2-lamb/merlin_196810932_3a2dcd03-7445-45db-bd21-f3b45ee70121-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, tagine, main course", "keywords": "apricot, chickpea, lamb, parsnip", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 246}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 4 to 5 pounds lamb shanks (4 total)", "Salt and pepper", "1/4 cup olive oil", "1 large onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 1/2 teaspoons grated garlic (from 1 large clove)", "1 dried bay leaf", "Large pinch of saffron", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 tablespoon sweet paprika", "1/2 pound dried apricots (1 generous cup)", "1 pound parsnips, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks (slice any larger end pieces in half lengthwise)", "1 (14-ounce) can chickpeas, drained (1 1/2 cups)", "1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season lamb shanks generously with salt and pepper.
