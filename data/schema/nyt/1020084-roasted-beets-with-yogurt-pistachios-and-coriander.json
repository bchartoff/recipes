{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Beets With Yogurt, Pistachios and Coriander", "description": "This sophisticated side is easy enough for a weeknight, but fancy enough for entertaining thanks to a few unexpected additions: Seasoned Greek yogurt forms the basis of an effortless sauce, while toasted coriander seeds and chopped pistachios add texture. Roasting sweet, earthy beets concentrates their flavor, and a splash of balsamic balances out their sweetness. This dish can be prepared in advance and served hot, cold or at room temperature, but its assembly should be done just before serving so the toasted coriander seeds and roasted pistachios retain their crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Aaron Hutcherson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/06/dining/ah-roasted-beets/ah-roasted-beets-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weeknight, vegetables", "keywords": "balsamic vinegar, beets, coriander, coriander seeds, greek yogurt, pistachio, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 212}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 236, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "453 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 small beets (about 2 pounds total)", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 teaspoons whole coriander seeds", "2/3 cup plain full-fat Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar", "1/4 cup roughly chopped roasted pistachios"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
