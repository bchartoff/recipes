{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple-Walnut Blondies", "description": "An autumnal riff on classic blondies, these are a treat for the true maple fanatic. Adding maple syrup to the batter and toasting the walnuts in maple syrup gives the blondies double the maple flavor, while a splash of bourbon in the batter mellows the sweetness. Make sure to underbake these slightly: The key to moist, chewy blondies is to take them out just before they\u2019re fully baked. Refrigerate the blondies for optimal chewiness; they're especially good straight from the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/dining/lh-maple-blondies/lh-maple-blondies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "9 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, cookies and bars", "keywords": "bourbon, maple syrup, vanilla, walnut, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 262}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted, plus more for greasing the pan", "3/4 cup/165 grams light brown sugar, lightly packed", "2 tablespoons maple syrup", "1 large egg", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon bourbon (optional)", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "Pinch of ground nutmeg", "1/2 cup/50 grams walnuts or pecans", "1 tablespoon maple syrup", "Pinch of kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
