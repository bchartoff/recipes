{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spanish Tortilla", "description": "The Spanish tortilla has nothing in common with the Mexican variety except its shape and its name. One is just a bread. The other can be an appetizer, a snack, or even a light meal. But the Spanish tortilla has another advantage: because it is better at room temperature than it is hot, it should be made in advance, anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours. In its most basic form, the tortilla is a potato and egg open-faced omelet that derives most of its flavor from olive oil. Onions or scallions can replace the potato in part or entirely, as can cooked greens like chard. The only hard part is turning the partly formed tortilla, so do it swiftly and carefully (using a nonstick skillet makes it much easier). The worst that will happen is that a little potato and egg will be left behind when you return the cake to the skillet. If you can't bring yourself to risk the flip, just slide the pan into a 375-degree oven until the eggs are completely set, but not overcooked.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/07/dining/07COOKING-SPANISHTORTILLA1/07COOKING-SPANISHTORTILLA1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "3 main-course or 6 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "brunch", "keywords": "appetizer, eggs, onion, potato, fall, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 507}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 980, "unsaturatedFatContent": "67 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "84 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "988 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds potatoes, 3 or 4 medium", "1 medium onion", "1 cup olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "6 extra-large or jumbo eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel and thinly slice potatoes and onions; it's easiest if you use a mandoline.
