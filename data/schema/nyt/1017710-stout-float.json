{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stout Float", "description": "How many of my favorite flavors can be packed into a glass? Plenty. Stout, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla make for a grown-up, earthy (but still fun) take on a float. I prefer a deeply chocolatey stout for this, but it\u2019s just grand with any deep, dark porter you love\u2014although I\u2019d steer clear of oyster stouts for this. The vanilla seeds in the whipped cream may seem like a minor detail, but they\u2019re not: they help to bring all the flavors together, and the small, brown flecks complement the rich color of the stout.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/20/magazine/20drink/20mag-20drink-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "stout, coffee liquer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 oz. coffee liqueur (preferably Fair Caf\u00e9)", "2 scoops vanilla ice cream", "6 oz. stout (I like Young\u2019s Double Chocolate)", "Unsweetened whipped cream flavored with vanilla seeds", "Dark chocolate for grating"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To a tall, soda-fountain-style glass (or an imperial pint glass), add the coffee liqueur and one scoop of the ice cream.
