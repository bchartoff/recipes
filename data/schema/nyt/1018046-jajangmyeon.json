{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jajangmyeon", "description": "This dish is a Koreanified take on the fried sauce noodles served in the Shandong province of China. It occupies a similar place in Korean cuisine to the one General Tso\u2019s chicken has in American food: a birth-country meal translated to accommodate the too-tired-to-cook takeout tastes of a host nation. It is milder than the Chinese original, a little more porky, the sort of dish you\u2019ll have people asking you to make once or twice a month. You\u2019ll need thick white-wheat noodles, like udon, and some of the Korean black-bean paste known as chunjang, available at Korean markets and online. If you can\u2019t find pickled daikon to serve as a garnish, some raw onions dressed in vinegar will make a fine alternative.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/03/magazine/03eat/03eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "noodles", "keywords": "chunjang, pork belly, pork shoulder, udon noodles, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 93}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 996, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "99 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "51 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "1008 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola", "8 ounces pork belly, cut into half-inch dice", "8 ounce pork shoulder, cut into half-inch dice", "2 inches of ginger root, peeled and minced", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "1 small carrot, peeled and diced", "1 large waxy potato, like a Yukon gold, peeled and diced", "1 Spanish onion, peeled and diced", "1 zucchini, 1/2 peeled and diced, 1/2 peeled and julienned", "1/2 cup chunjang, Korean black-bean paste", "2 tablespoons light brown sugar", "Kosher salt to taste", "1 pound fresh udon noodles", "1/2 cup pickled yellow daikon radish, cut into half moons"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a wok or large saut\u00e9 pan over high heat, and add the oil to it.
