{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Salad With Peanuts and Tofu", "description": "With a little advance preparation, this spicy salad can be made in 30 minutes. You can cook the two kinds of rices together if you soak the red rice for an hour first; the antioxidant-rich pigment from the red rice will bleed into the white rice, turning it an attractive  pale rusty color, which is nice. The marinade and the rice will keep for about 3 days in the refrigerator. The baked tofu will also keep, in the marinade, for a couple of days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/15/dining/Rice-With-Peanuts/Rice-With-Peanuts-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, quick, salads and dressings, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 83}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup red rice, soaked for 1 hour and drained", "1 cup basmati or jasmine rice, rinsed", "2 1/2 cups water", "Salt to taste (I use about 3/4 teaspoon)", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "1/2 cup lightly toasted unsalted peanuts, chopped (about 2 ounces)", "1 cup English peas, steamed for 5 minutes if using fresh, thawed if frozen", "1 bunch green onions or, chopped, or 1/4 cup chopped chives", "1 to 2 serrano chiles or bird chiles, minced", "Romaine or leaf lettuce for the platter or plates", "1 avocado, sliced,  avocado for garnish (1 avocado)", "Black sesame seeds for garnish", "1/2 tablespoon minced ginger", "2 tablespoons soy sauce, preferably tamari", "1 14-ounce block of organic extra-firm tofu (find one that is not too dry)", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1/2 tablespoon minced shallot", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "1/8 teaspoon of cayenne", "1 tablespoon honey or agave nectar", "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons fresh lime juice", "3 tablespoons toasted peanut oil", "3 tablespoons grapeseed grape seed oil or canola oil (use 6 tablespoons if toasted peanut oil is not available)", "Chopped cilantro (whatever is left of the bunch you use for the salad) or cilantro sprigs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the two kinds of two rices in a medium saucepan.
