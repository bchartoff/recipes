Grate eight or 10 scrapings of nutmeg into the cream, or more if you wish. Add the shredded sprouts and turn in the cream to coat the sprouts well.

Check for seasoning, adding salt and freshly ground white pepper if necessary. Serve immediately."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1388-anton-mosimanns-braised-brussels-sprouts-in-cream"}
