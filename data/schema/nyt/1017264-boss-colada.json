The recognizably tiki-esque m\u00e9lange of rum and fruit juices is given a delightfully sharp edge by a full ounce of the bitter herbal liqueur Baska Snaps, while the heavy portioning of Peychaud\u2019s bitters helps to dry out the cloying sweetness of the pineapple juice and the orgeat, an almond-flavored syrup. An unlikely but well-balanced cocktail, it is perfect in the hotter months, but good all year round.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/04/dining/04NORDIC2/04NORDIC2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "Baska snaps, orgeat syrup, pineapple juice, white rum", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 10}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce Baska Snaps", "1/2 ounce orgeat, preferably Orgeat Works", "1/2 ounce white rum, preferably Banks 7", "1 1/2 ounces fresh pineapple juice", "1/2 ounce fresh lime juice", "21 drops Peychaud\u2019s bitters", "Lime wheel"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a pilsner glass with crushed or pebble ice.
