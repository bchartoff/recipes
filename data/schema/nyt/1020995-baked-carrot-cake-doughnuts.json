{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Carrot Cake Doughnuts", "description": "Lightly spiced and crowned with a tangy cream cheese glaze, these doughnuts are, quite simply, carrot cake baked into doughnut-shaped molds for a cuter, handheld form. (The batter could also be baked in greased mini-muffin or standard muffin tins; adjust the cooking time accordingly and bake until golden.) The floral sweetness of the golden raisins works well with the earthy carrots, but feel free to swap in your favorite chopped nuts instead. These come together in minutes without a mixer, and can be on your table within an hour. Like most doughnuts, they\u2019re best enjoyed the day they\u2019re made.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/dining/ss-baked-carrot-cake-doughnuts/merlin_171379626_6fa47593-6fda-4e6c-898d-e9e96f55d25c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "12 doughnuts", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, finger foods, pastries, dessert", "keywords": "carrot, cinnamon, flour, ginger, nutmeg, raisin, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 335}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters vegetable oil", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/110 grams dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1 1/4 cups/115 grams grated carrots", "1/2 cup/70 grams golden raisins", "4 ounces/115 grams cream cheese", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
