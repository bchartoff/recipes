{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Mushrooms, Fried Eggs and Herbs", "description": "This fall-inspired, earthy pasta uses a combination of mushrooms for depth of flavor and is topped with a runny egg, which silkens up the sauce. Supermarkets these days generally have a good selection of different varieties such as cremini and shiitake, but if your standard white-button mushroom is all that\u2019s available, this dish will still be a winner. If you\u2019re not feeling pasta, the mushrooms are equally good served on top of creamy polenta or on their own.
