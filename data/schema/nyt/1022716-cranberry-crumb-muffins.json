{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry Crumb Muffins", "description": "In these tender muffins, a crunchy topping adds nice textural contrast, and supertart cranberries keep the sweetness balanced. Fresh or frozen cranberries work well, but if using frozen cranberries, do not thaw them before they go into the batter. The batter may seem extra stiff from the cold berries, but it will bake up just fine. (They may need an extra minute or two in the oven.) Blueberries, raspberries, blackberries or a mix of the three would be lovely. If you use berries, you can expect some color streaking, but they will taste great. Chopped up in-season peaches or plums would be tasty, too. Use a spring-loaded ice cream scoop to portion muffin batter into the prepared pan: It\u2019s easy, quick and helps to keep the muffins the same size.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/29/dining/SSe-cranberry-muffins/SSe-cranberry-muffins-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "brown sugar, cranberry, flour, muffin, pecan, christmas, thanksgiving, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 738}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/96 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/89 grams loosely packed dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter, melted", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour", "2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "2 cups cranberries/227 grams, fresh or frozen (but not thawed)", "1 cup/99 grams pecans or walnuts, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup/120 grams full-fat sour cream, at room temperature", "1/4 cup whole milk, at room temperature", "8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/151 grams granulated sugar", "2 large eggs, at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.
