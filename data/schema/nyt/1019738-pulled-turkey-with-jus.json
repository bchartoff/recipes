{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pulled Turkey With Jus", "description": "This stripped-down, built-for-flavor recipe, adapted from \u201cMeathead: The Science of Great Barbecue and Grilling\u201d by Meathead Goldwyn,\u00a0is for people who don\u2019t brine, forgot to brine or didn\u2019t leave enough time to salt a bird and leave it in the refrigerator for 24 hours. It keeps the white meat moist and boosts its flavor with a rich, simple jus of stock fortified with soy sauce and deglazed pan drippings. The idea comes from Southern barbecue pit masters who shred or chop the meat from a pork shoulder and wet it with vinegar, black pepper and maybe a little tomato. The turkey is roasted slowly to keep the meat fibers from seizing up, and the breast meat is shredded or sliced so thin it falls apart. The meat is then dunked in the jus and served in a dish deep enough to hold both meat and liquid. The thigh meat and legs can be served alongside on a separate platter. The next day, the jus-soaked meat and a little cup of extra jus make for a perfect turkey French dip.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/14/dining/14Brinerex1/14Brinerex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings, with leftovers", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken stock, turkey, white wine, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1023, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "140 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "2026 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 turkey, preferably about 12 pounds, although the recipe produces enough jus for larger birds", "2 tablespoons salt", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 celery stalk", "1 medium carrot", "1 medium onion", "3 or 4 branches fresh herbs, including sage and thyme", "1 tablespoon olive oil or vegetable oil", "Neck, giblets and wing tips from one turkey (don\u2019t use the liver)", "2 carrots, cut into 2 or 3 pieces", "3 celery stalks, cut into thirds", "1 large onion, peeled and cut into quarters", "1 teaspoon salt", "Ground pepper", "1 1/2 cups good white wine", "4 cups chicken broth (water can be substituted, but broth yields richer results)", "1 clove garlic, peeled", "A few sage leaves and 1 or 2 sprigs fresh thyme", "1 teaspoon soy sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the turkey: Heat oven to 325 degrees.
