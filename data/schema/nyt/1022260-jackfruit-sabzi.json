{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jackfruit Sabzi", "description": "This recipe for a simple jackfruit sabzi comes from the British chef Romy Gill, who adapted much of her Punjabi family\u2019s vegetarian home cooking for her book \u201cZaika: Vegan Recipe from India.\u201d In Burnpur, where Ms. Gill grew up, jackfruit grew wild on the trees around her home, and her mother worked with an oiled knife to take apart the heavy, unwieldy fruit. But in England, where she lives now, Ms. Gill reaches for canned jackfruit. Make sure to pick vegetal, unripe jackfruit in brine \u2014 rather than sweet, ripe jackfruit in syrup \u2014 then drain the pieces, breaking up any large ones until bite-size, and add them to the pan. Serve the sabzi with rice, roti, or, as Ms. Gill often does for her daughters, rolled up in a big, tender wrap.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/30/magazine/30mag-eat/30mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, main course", "keywords": "curry leaves, garam masala, tomato, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 323}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons neutral oil, like sunflower", "1 teaspoon black mustard seeds", "1 yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1 sprig curry leaves", "1 (20-ounce) can jackfruit pieces in brine, drained (about 10 ounces)", "2 beefsteak or large Roma tomatoes, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon amchur (dried mango powder)", "1 teaspoon Kashmiri chile powder", "1 teaspoon garam masala", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "Basmati rice or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020906-roti\">roti</a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a medium skillet over medium heat, and add the oil and mustard seeds.
