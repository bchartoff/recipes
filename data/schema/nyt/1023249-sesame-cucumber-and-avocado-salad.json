{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame Cucumber and Avocado Salad", "description": "Crispy cucumber and creamy avocado perform a delicate dance with earthy notes of sesame in this most simple of salads. Thin-skinned varieties such as Persian or English cucumbers work best, as they are almost seedless with a robust flesh that stays crisp. But don\u2019t worry if you only have access to seedy cucumbers: Peel them if their skins are thick, then cut them in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds before slicing. No-cook and ready in a matter of minutes, this elegant salad can be dressed up according to your mood. It is a satisfying meal on its own, but it can also be served alongside cold soba noodles, or with brown rice and a fried or jammy egg on top.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/02/dining/hm-sesame-cucumber-and-avocado-salad/merlin_207623952_1297df24-9564-42d3-84f5-0367fc42db88-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, quick, weeknight, salads and dressings, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "avocado, cucumber, sesame oil, healthy, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1588}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil", "2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce or tamari", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "2 ripe avocados", "1 pound cucumbers (such as Persian or English), trimmed and thinly sliced", "2 green, red or purple scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "Toasted sesame seeds, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: Place the sesame oil, rice vinegar, sesame seeds, sugar, soy sauce and red-pepper flakes into a small bowl.
