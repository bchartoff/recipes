This is an easy method for roasted artichokes. After trimming and par-cooking them, they are drizzled with olive oil and roasted until crisp without and tender within. Serve them as a first course, or alongside a meaty piece of fish, such as monkfish, swordfish or halibut. The zesty, lemony anchovy mayonnaise is a perfect foil for the artichokes\u2019 sweetness, and goes well with fish, too. You can use any size artichoke for this recipe, but medium is best.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/10kitchen1/10kitchen1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "anchovy, artichoke, mayonnaise, appetizer, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 196}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large lemon", "4 medium artichokes (about 2 pounds)", "Salt and pepper", "1 large bunch thyme sprigs", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley, for garnish", "1 cup mayonnaise, preferably <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2650-basic-light-mayonnaise\">homemade</a>", "6 anchovy fillets, rinsed, blotted and finely chopped", "1 teaspoon capers, rinsed, blotted and finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest and 2 tablespoons juice (from 1 lemon)", "1/2 teaspoon grated garlic (from about 2 medium cloves)", "Pinch of ground cayenne", "Salt and pepper, to taste", "Lemon wedges (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the artichokes: Fill a large bowl with cold water.
