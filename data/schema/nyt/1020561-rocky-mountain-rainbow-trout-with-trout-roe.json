Trout from the icy Rocky Mountain streams are at their best in late spring, when the ice has just melted. Cooks from the Shoshone tribe, among many others, make delicious meals using the entire fish, wasting nothing: Cheeks and eyes are considered a delicacy, as is the roe harvested from the females, which is prized for its distinct flavor and its relationship to renewal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sean Sherman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/06/dining/04NativeAmericanrex5/merlin_163486770_ccb18e9b-8011-4c8f-bb9d-30f1576016d5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood", "keywords": "main course, rainbow trout, sumac, trout roe, walnut, watercress", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 whole, head-on rainbow trout (about 3/4 pound each), rinsed and patted dry", "1 tablespoon sumac powder", "2 teaspoons coarse sea salt", "3 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus more for drizzling (optional)", "1/4 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped", "1 small bunch watercress (or other dark greens, such as arugula or spinach), for garnish", "1/4 cup trout roe, salmon roe or paddlefish roe, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Open the trout fillets and fan out like a book, lifting open both fillets to create an even, somewhat flat surface."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, mix together the sumac and salt.
