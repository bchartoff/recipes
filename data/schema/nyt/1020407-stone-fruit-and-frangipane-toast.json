{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stone Fruit and Frangipane Toast", "description": "Juicy, late-summer fruits and rich almond frangipane do the hard work here. Consider making these toasts an exercise in generosity rather than technique: Spread frangipane thickly and all the way to the edges of the toast and err on the side of too much fruit, torn roughly and tossed with a pinch of salt, and some sugar to encourage caramelization. If serving this for an after-dinner dessert, add a splash of red wine to the fruit and serve with a dollop of mascarpone. If this is breakfast, you might prefer Greek yogurt as an accompaniment, or a glug of heavy cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clare de Boer"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/28/dining/27Diaryrex2/merlin_159057141_bd849ea9-5396-4b5c-964c-36355dabb3d0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack", "keywords": "almond flour, greek yogurt, peach, sourdough, stone fruit, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 63}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), softened", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon and 4 teaspoons", "2 egg yolks", "3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon/90 grams almond flour", "Flaky sea salt", "4 slices sourdough bread (each about 1/2-inch thick), from the middle of a large loaf", "2 pounds ripe peaches, plums, apricots or other stone fruits", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for garnish", "Heavy cream, whipped cream or Greek yogurt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
