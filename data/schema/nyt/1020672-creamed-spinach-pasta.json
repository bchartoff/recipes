{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamed Spinach Pasta", "description": "This pasta nods to everyone\u2019s favorite steakhouse side, and it comes together in no time, making for a fine weeknight meal. One full pound of fresh spinach is cooked down in garlicky butter before cream is added, then simmered until thickened. The cooked pasta is added directly to the sauce, then tossed with ricotta cheese for even more richness. Fettuccine or tagliatelle pasta work best, but the creamy sauce will cling to any long noodles. Top with pine nuts, walnuts or hazelnuts for crunch, or leave the nuts out entirely. Serve as a side to grilled steak, chicken or fish, or serve it on its own, paired simply with a glass of bubbles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/25/dining/ch-creamed-spinach-pasta/ch-creamed-spinach-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, pastas", "keywords": "fettuccine, nutmeg, pasta, ricotta, spinach, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 460}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup whole-milk ricotta", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound long pasta, such as fettuccine or tagliatelle", "3 tablespoons pine nuts (optional)", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1 pound fresh baby spinach", "1 cup heavy cream", "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "Grated pecorino or Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the ricotta to a large bowl; season well with salt and pepper and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
