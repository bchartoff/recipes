{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Braised White Beans", "description": "Everything you need to make this humble-but-satisfying meal is probably in your kitchen at this very moment. Two cans of beans (chickpeas and white beans) are simmered with milk, a whole head of garlic, herbs and nutmeg for a rich and creamy vegetarian dinner that can be on the table in under a half-hour. Be sure to use whole milk here \u2014 it's the most flavorful and will yield the best results. Feel free to wilt greens like chard, watercress, arugula or basil into the beans, and serve with grated Parmesan and red-pepper flakes. A slice of crusty bread slicked with caramelized garlic is the perfect crunchy accompaniment to velvety beans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/07/dining/as-white-beans-toast/as-white-beans-toast-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for one, for two, lunch, quick, weekday, beans", "keywords": "chickpea, garlic, white beans, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2252}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 428, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "14 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "732 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 head garlic, halved crosswise", "1 cup whole milk", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, with their liquid", "1 (15-ounce) can white beans, such as cannellini or Great Northern, drained and rinsed", "1 thyme sprig, 2 sage leaves or 1 bay leaf", "1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg, allspice or garam masala", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 slices crusty bread or thick toast", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving", "Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving", "Aleppo pepper or red-pepper flakes, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.
