{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Galette", "description": "Every part of this simple galette has its charms. The crust is easy to pull together and since it\u2019s rolled out flat \u2014 no crimping or fluting \u2014 it\u2019s doable even if you\u2019re not a pie-hand. The topping is thin slices of sweet potato and apple brushed with maple syrup. And the filling is a hidden gem, a mix of cream cheese, Parmesan and maple syrup spiked with chile powder. Here, it\u2019s piment d\u2019Ville, a California chile grown from the seeds of piment d\u2019Espelette, native to French Basque Country. This type of chile is warm and toasty, a little hot and a little sweet and a jazzy partner that swings sweet and savory, just like the rest of the galette.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/07/magazine/07mag-eat-site/07mag-eat-site-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pies and tarts, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "apple, pie pastry, sweet potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 301}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/192 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "8 tablespoons/113 grams very cold unsalted butter, cut into 16 pieces", "About 1/4 cup/60 milliliters ice water", "3 ounces/85 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "3 tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more for sprinkling", "1 tablespoon milk", "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons pure maple syrup", "1 to 2 teaspoons piment d\u2019Ville, piment d'Espelette or other ground red chile", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 medium sweet potato, scrubbed and dried", "1 medium red apple, rinsed and dried", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 to 3 tablespoons chopped pecans, for sprinkling (optional)", "Snipped chives, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor to mix.
