It came to The Times from Dr. Carolyn Ling, a physician in Carmel, Ind., whose grandfather came to the United States in the late 19th century from southern China and set up an import-export firm in Manhattan. There were other investments as well. Her grandfather, Dr. Ling told me, had \u201cinterests in restaurants.\u201d Those interests played a big role in the Ling family\u2019s early Thanksgiving feasts: They ate takeout. Dr. Ling\u2019s father, a doctor who fought at Anzio in Italy in 1944 and earned a Bronze Star, loved those meals. When Dr. Ling was young, she said, her father urged her mother, a passionate home cook and reader of Gourmet, to emulate them in her holiday cooking at home in Forest Hills, Queens. The result is remarkably easy to prepare, phenomenally juicy, and rich, Dr. Ling said, \u201cwith the umami of soy and turkey fat.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/dining/COOKING-TURKEY1/COOKING-CHINESE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "main course, potato, soybean sauce, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 223}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 829, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "96 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "1934 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 12- to 14-pound turkey", "4 tablespoons neutral oil (such as canola)", "6 garlic cloves, minced", "1 3-inch knob ginger, peeled and minced", "6 scallions, thinly sliced", "2 leeks, thinly sliced (white and light green parts only)", "4 stalks celery, thinly sliced", "1/3 cup soybean sauce (preferably Lee Kum Kee brand)", "1 2-inch strip dried orange or tangerine peel (or use 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed orange juice)", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "1/2 cup rice wine or sherry", "1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper", "3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons oyster sauce", "3 1/2 pounds small Yukon Gold potatoes, halved", "Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove turkey from refrigerator and pat dry with paper towels.
