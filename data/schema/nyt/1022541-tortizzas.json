A fresh mix of cucumbers, tomatoes and avocado, mounded atop the tortillas, makes you feel like you\u2019re eating a salad with your hands. Feta delivers sharpness and creaminess, as does the simple garlicky yogurt sauce that drapes each tortizza. A drizzle of honey at the end might sound out of place here, but it really brings together all the flavors, and is a popular dipping sauce for pizza in South Korea.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/10/dining/EK-tortizza/EK-tortizza-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, main course", "keywords": "cucumber, flour tortillas, tomato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 771}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 4 Persian or mini seedless cucumbers, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 2 cups)", "2 ripe medium tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 2 cups)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "8 (6-inch) soft flour tortillas", "2 cups shredded low-moisture mozzarella", "2 teaspoons dried oregano, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021922-zaatar\">za\u2019atar</a> or Italian seasoning", "1 cup plain yogurt", "1 large garlic clove, finely grated", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "2 teaspoons honey, plus more for drizzling", "1 cup crumbled feta", "1 ripe Hass avocado, halved and thinly sliced", "1/2 cup packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and heat oven to 400 degrees.
