{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grapefruit Crumb Cake", "description": "Tiny bursts of juicy, tart grapefruit mitigate the richness of this moist crumb cake, topped with almond and brown sugar. You can substitute oranges, tangerines or other tangy fruit for the grapefruit; you\u2019re looking for 1 1/2 cup fruit total. Just avoid anything too sweet (like blueberries, peaches and bing cherries). You need the acidity to balance out the sugary crumb topping. (If substituting other fruit, skip the sprinkling of salt.) If you don\u2019t have a springform pan, use a regular 10-inch cake pan that\u2019s at least 1 1/2-inches deep, then serve cake directly out of the pan instead of unmolding.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/25/dining/25appetite2/merlin_136926486_beac2021-c91e-49d4-be33-f7e1a2bd7c85-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, cakes", "keywords": "almond, grapefruit, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 153}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 628, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "268 milligrams", "sugarContent": "42 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups/155 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/145 grams light brown sugar", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom or ginger", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/55 grams slivered almonds", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), melted", "2 large red or pink grapefruits", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sour cream", "3 large eggs", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, more for sprinkling", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cubed, softened, plus more for greasing the pan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and butter a 10-inch springform pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crumb topping: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cinnamon, cardamom and salt.
