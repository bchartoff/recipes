{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Roasted Fish Fillets With Herb Butter", "description": "A blast of heat in a cast-iron pan and a basting of golden butter does wonders for plain fish fillets. This life-changing method is adopted from a former chef and current fishmonger, Mark Usewicz of Mermaid\u2019s Garden in Brooklyn, who also teaches cooking classes in topics like \u201cHow to Cook Fish in a New York City Apartment.\u201d The cooking time is so short that the smell \u2014 which, if your fish is fresh and not funky, should not be overpowering \u2014 will dissipate quickly. And in the meantime, you have an easy dinner of tender fish with a toothsome crust, anointed with nutty, lemony brown butter and perfumed with herbs.\n\nYou can use virtually any fish fillet, skin on or off, as long as it is not too thick. If the butter is browning too fast, reduce the heat and add a nut of cold butter to prevent scorching, or squeeze in the juice of half a lemon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/15/multimedia/recipelab-fish/recipelab-fish-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick", "keywords": "fish fillets, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1982}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 461, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "471 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 5- to 6-ounce fish fillets, like black bass, haddock, fluke, striped bass, tilefish, snapper or salmon, 1/2- to 1-inch thick", "Salt and ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 sprigs fresh thyme, tarragon, chives or another herb", "1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley, optional", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat fillets dry with a paper towel.
