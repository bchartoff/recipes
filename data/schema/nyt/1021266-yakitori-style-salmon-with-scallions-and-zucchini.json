{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Yakitori-Style Salmon With Scallions and Zucchini", "description": "Yakitori is a Japanese dish in which boneless chicken pieces seasoned with salt (shio) and a soy basting sauce (tare) are threaded onto bamboo skewers and grilled over a charcoal fire. This weeknight meal borrows the flavors of traditional yakitori and applies it to salmon and vegetables. A salty-sweet sauce of soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, garlic and ginger doubles as a glaze and serving sauce. Tossed with greens, the leftover salmon and vegetables make a nice salad the next day, and the sauce keeps in the refrigerator for up to a week. Brush it onto chicken or pork chops before roasting, or use it to season your next clean-out-the-fridge fried rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/16/dining/kc-salmon-yakitori/merlin_175275564_d6ed320f-e036-4b38-b5bd-f90980d001a4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "rice vinegar, salmon fillet, scallion, soy sauce, zucchini, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1540}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup canola oil, plus more for greasing", "1 tablespoon minced garlic (from about 3 cloves)", "1 tablespoon minced ginger (from a 1-inch piece)", "2/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/3 cup turbinado sugar", "2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1 pound small zucchini (about 3), trimmed and sliced 1/8-inch-thick", "8 scallions, trimmed, halved lengthwise, if large, and cut into 2-inch pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 pounds boneless, skinless salmon fillets, cut into 1-inch pieces", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-low.
