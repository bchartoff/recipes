{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimbap", "description": "Kimbap, or \u201cseaweed rice,\u201d is often mistakenly referred to as sushi, but it is a popular Korean dish with its own unique flavors and history. These rolls can be simple, with just a single sheet of seaweed wrapped around cooked rice, or complex, with entire restaurants dedicated to serving variations of kimbap. This recipe uses traditional fillings, like a mix of vegetables, egg and meat, but other popular fillings include cucumber, imitation crab, bulgogi or canned tuna. It\u2019s very adaptable, and it does well with substitutions. Leftover kimbap can be kept in the refrigerator, but the rice will lose some of its moisture, so to serve a second time, soak each piece in beaten egg, then pan-fry them until golden.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Darun Kwak"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/09/dining/dk-kimbap/merlin_176534694_3e9c925a-3854-44c7-b412-9b46714ba583-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 rolls (2 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, finger foods, grains and rice, main course, side dish", "keywords": "dairy-free, egg, nori, sesame oil, short grain rice, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 443}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 packed cups raw spinach (about 3 ounces)", "1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Neutral oil, for saut\u00e9eing", "1/2 medium or large carrot, peeled and julienned", "1 thin sheet of eomuk (fish cake), cut into 1/4-inch-thick strips", "3 ounces canned Spam, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick strips", "2 eggs, beaten", "4 strips of danmuji (pickled yellow radish), see Tip", "4 gim (nori) sheets", "3 cups freshly cooked short-grain rice", "1 tablespoon sesame oil, plus more for brushing", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, or more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the spinach: Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the spinach until it turns bright green, about 45 seconds.
