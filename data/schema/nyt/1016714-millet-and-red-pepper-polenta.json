There are two ways to make this dish.\nOne  thing I like best about this savory polenta  is that if you do have leftovers, you can reheat them or grill them for quick meals, or even eat the leftovers cold. Take them to work or pack them in a lunchbox. I have made this dish two ways: In the first, shown here, roasted peppers are stirred into the millet halfway through. In the second version, peppers and onions are saut\u00e9ed with garlic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/06/science/08recipehealth/08recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fall, summer, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 9}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 182, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "484 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 red bell peppers, roasted", "1 cup millet", "4 cups water (or stock)", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 tablespoon butter (more to taste)", "1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan", "Freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
