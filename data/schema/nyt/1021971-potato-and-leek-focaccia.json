To ensure that the potatoes cook through in the same amount of time as the leeks and focaccia, they need to be sliced very thinly, so use a mandoline or slice them meticulously using a sharp knife. Like most focaccia, this one is best enjoyed fresh from the oven, but leftovers are great warmed in a toaster oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/15/dining/ya-potato-and-leek-focaccia/merlin_183942324_07909d51-9e8c-40a6-9547-a6af11910ef5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20H30M", "recipeYield": "1 focaccia (about 12 pieces)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, breads, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "active dry yeast, leek, thyme, yukon gold potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 343}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/420 milliliters warm water (about 100 degrees)", "2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "3 1/2 cups/448 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan", "1 leek, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced, about 1 cup (100 grams)", "1 medium Yukon Gold potato, thinly sliced and cut into half moons (about 1 cup/165 grams)", "3 fresh thyme sprigs", "Kosher salt and pepper", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan or pecorino"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the water, yeast and sugar together in a large bowl.
