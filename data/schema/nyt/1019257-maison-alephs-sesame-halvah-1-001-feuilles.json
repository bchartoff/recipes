{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maison Aleph\u2019s Sesame-Halvah 1,001 Feuilles", "description": "This sweet straddles East and West. Its name plays on French mille-feuille (mille-feuille means 1,000 leaves), but its structure follows the lines of Middle Eastern baklava. It\u2019s got layers of buttered and sugared phyllo dough and a filling made with tahini and vanilla halvah. The mixture is similar to frangipane, but not like any I\u2019ve ever tasted \u2014 it\u2019s completely original and wonderfully good. A word on the phyllo: If the sheets are smaller than 12-by-17-inches, don\u2019t worry \u2014 the dessert will bake the same way, but the middle layer will be slightly thicker and the yield will be less. For the most delicious pastry, use clarified butter: Bring the butter to a boil in a medium saucepan. Lower the heat and simmer until most of the solids fall to the bottom of the pan; the bubbling will have subsided. Slowly pour the butter through a coffee filter or a strainer lined with cheesecloth; discard the solids and reserve the liquid. You can make the butter weeks ahead and keep it refrigerated.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/08/magazine/08mag-ondessert1/08mag-08ondessert-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "About 35 squares", "recipeCuisine": "french, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "pastries", "keywords": "dessert, phyllo, tahini, vanilla halvah, white sesame seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 47}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 219, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "110 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "2/3 cup/120 grams vanilla halvah", "Scant 1/3 cup/75 grams tahini (stir before measuring)", "1 cup/120 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel (or 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt)", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/50 grams toasted white sesame seeds", "28 sheets phyllo dough (12 inches by 17 inches), thawed", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters clarified butter (from 4 sticks/452 grams)", "About 1 1/2 cups/180 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 tablespoons white sesame seeds, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the filling: Working with a mixer (preferably fitted with a paddle attachment), beat the butter, halvah and tahini together on medium speed for about 3 minutes.
