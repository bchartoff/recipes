{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Boston Cream Pie", "description": "An American classic, Boston cream pie isn't a pie at all. Its base is an old-fashioned hot milk cake, a downy-soft, buttery yellow cake. How you whip the eggs and the sugar is critical, as the tiny air bubbles they produce add lift to the finished product.\n\nThis traditional version is best the day it's made, but will hold up in the fridge for a couple of days. You may just notice a slight change in texture. Slathered with homemade vanilla custard and a chocolate glaze, it hits all the right notes, but it would be just as lovely served with in-season berries or layered with chocolate or coffee custard instead of vanilla. Make it as is, or go rogue. Either way, it\u2019s sure to please.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/27/dining/27COOKING-BOSTON-CREAM-PIE1/27COOKING-BOSTON-CREAM-PIE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert, heavy cream, semisweet chocolate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 496}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 461, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "279 milligrams", "sugarContent": "39 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "Pinch kosher salt", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy cream", "1 tablespoon/14 grams unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "8 tablespoons/114 grams (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, plus more for the pan", "1 3/4 cups/224 grams all-purpose flour", "1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters whole milk", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy cream", "4 ounces/113 grams semisweet chocolate chips", "1 teaspoon neutral oil, such as safflower", "Pinch kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the custard: In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well combined.
