{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Glazed Chicken Breasts", "description": "This one-skillet chicken has a spicy, pleasantly tart and punchy glaze that\u2019s built on frying a little tomato paste in garlic- and almond-infused oil, then deglazing with lemon juice. It tastes like you sun-dried lots of tomatoes for weeks. (But you don\u2019t need to do that.) The final flourish is the crunchy fried almonds and garlic. You could skip them, but they add a special touch that belies how fast the dish comes together. Besides chicken, the dish also can be made with any other ingredient that browns well, like tofu or even broccoli.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/19/dining/as-glazed-chicken/as-glazed-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "almonds, chicken, tomato paste", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 191}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1\u00bd to 2 pounds total)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup sliced almonds", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons tomato paste (preferably double concentrate)", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 tablespoon lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken dry and pound to an even \u00bd-inch thickness with a heavy skillet or meat pounder."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) skillet, combine the oil, almonds and garlic.
