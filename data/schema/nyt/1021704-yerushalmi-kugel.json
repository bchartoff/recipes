{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Yerushalmi Kugel", "description": "A specialty of Jerusalem, this dark, dense kugel is bound by eggs and caramel, and sharpened with loads of black pepper. In this recipe, adapted from the cookbook author Adeena Sussman, the edges crisp as it bakes, providing a crunchy contrast to the soft, springy noodles inside. Don\u2019t stray from the pan while the sugar is caramelizing, or it may burn in spots. Serve it in wedges, either warm or at room temperature. Leftover Yerushalmi kugel will keep for at least five days in the fridge, and reheats well in a 350-degree oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/09/dining/07apperex-kugel/merlin_180810273_be574a42-3b95-4161-8392-b47a2d703f24-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "noodles, main course", "keywords": "egg noodles, eggs, sugar, hanukkah, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1105}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1 (12-ounce) package thin egg noodles (or use angel hair pasta)", "1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed, sunflower or vegetable", "1 1/4 cups granulated sugar", "6 large eggs, beaten", "2 1/4 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
