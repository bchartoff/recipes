{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Firehouse Chili Gumbo", "description": "This recipe is adapted from the one that a Louisiana firefighter named Jeremy Chauvin entered into a national cook-off run by Hormel Foods in 2017, and that took home the prize for America\u2019s Best Firehouse Chili. It is not really a chili in the Texas sense of the word. There is a roux at its base \u2014 it\u2019s more like a chili gumbo, a bayou take on the original red. Serve with grated cheese and corn chips. Chauvin told me he was moved to enter the chili contest as a way to honor his brother Spencer, also a firefighter, who was killed in the line of duty in 2016. \u201cI just want people to remember his sacrifice,\u201d he said.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/magazine/08eat1/08eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "Serves 8 to 10", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "green pepper, ground beef, tomato, yellow peppers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 993}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed", "3 pounds ground beef, ideally coarse-ground", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground white pepper", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, or to taste", "2 tablespoons chile powder", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "3 tablespoons steak sauce", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "2 14.5-ounce cans diced tomatoes", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 large yellow onion, peeled and diced", "2 medium shallots, peeled and diced", "1 green bell pepper, diced", "1 yellow bell pepper, diced", "3 ribs celery, trimmed and diced", "3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "2 6-ounce cans tomato paste", "2 8-ounce cans tomato sauce", "1 to 2 cups tomato juice", "1 cup ketchup", "1 tablespoon apple-cider vinegar, or to taste", "2 tablespoons hot sauce, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chili.
