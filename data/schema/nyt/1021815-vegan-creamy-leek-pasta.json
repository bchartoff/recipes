{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegan Creamy Leek Pasta", "description": "This four-ingredient leek pasta coaxes as much flavor and texture as possible out of a few leeks, a box of pasta, some olive oil and lemon (plus salt and pepper). Though it doesn\u2019t take long, this recipe is not fast \u2014 it\u2019s even a little bit fussy. You\u2019ll julienne and fry the leek whites to create a crispy garnish, then blend the resulting leek oil with boiled leek greens to create a silky sauce. You could absolutely make this dish on a weeknight, but since the recipe revolves around technique, it\u2019s best not to rush. It\u2019s about enjoying the process as much as the results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/27/dining/22pasta1/merlin_182443629_34ef2b16-9791-4184-bc28-82092d6c6e8c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas, main course", "keywords": "bucatini, leek, lemon, fall, winter, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1091}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 medium leeks (about 1 to 1 1/4 pounds total)", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound bucatini, fettuccine or linguine", "1 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, prepare your leeks: Trim 1/2 inch off both ends, then cut each leek crosswise, separating the bottom third of the white portion from the top two-thirds of light and dark leek greens.

Working in three to four batches for even cooking, add about 1/4 of the white leek strips and cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 4 minutes. The key here is to keep residual cooking in mind: Since your delicate leeks will continue cooking after being removed from the hot oil, you want to pull them from the hot oil when about a third of each batch is fully golden, a third is lightly golden and another third is still green. (They won\u2019t cook perfectly evenly; it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them and the nature of cooking.) Remove them swiftly, using a slotted spoon and tilting the saucepan to transfer the leeks to the paper towel-lined plate. Season to taste with salt. Repeat with the remaining batches.
