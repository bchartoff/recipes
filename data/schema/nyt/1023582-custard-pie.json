{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Custard Pie", "description": "Inspired by dan tat, small egg custard tarts popular in Cantonese dim sum, this pie is also reminiscent of American and European baked custards and flan from around the globe. The slick, jiggly vanilla filling is delicious for its comforting eggy flavor. It\u2019s simple to whisk together, but if that whisking results in bubbles that pop and crater on top, simply cover them up with a dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar or ground dehydrated berries. The berries add a pop of color and a hint of fruitiness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/13/dining/13PIESREX-custard/13PIESREX-custard-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "heavy cream, make-ahead, milk, pie, pie dough, vanilla extract, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 139}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 disk <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023573\">All-Butter Pie Crust</a>", "All-purpose flour, for rolling", "5 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups/365 grams whole milk", "1/2 cup/130 grams heavy cream", "2/3 cup/133 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract (see Tip)", "1/2 cup/10 grams freeze-dried strawberries or raspberries (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If the dough has been refrigerated for more than an hour, let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
