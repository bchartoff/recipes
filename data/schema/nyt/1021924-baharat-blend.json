{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baharat Blend", "description": "In Arabic, the term \u201cbaharat\u201d simply means \u201cspices\u201d and can refer to any number of different blends, each tailored to a specific dish or ingredients. This all-purpose blend, adapted from\u00a0Freda Nokaly and Doaa Elkady of <a href=\"http://www.spicetreeorganics.com/\">Spice Tree Organics</a>, reflects the women\u2019s Egyptian ancestry, highlighting a combination of musky cumin and floral, citrusy coriander that\u2019s been sweetened with an aromatic mix of cinnamon, cardamom and clove, and spiked with black pepper and bay leaf. Unlike some other baharat blends, this version doesn\u2019t call for first toasting the spices, giving it a subtle but distinct brightness. Use it in meatballs and pilafs, in marinade and sauces for grilled meats and fish, and in rice dishes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/24/dining/22Spicesrex3-Buharat/22Spicesrex3-Buharat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1/3 cup", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "allspice, cardamom, clove, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, nutmeg, peppercorns, spice blend", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 142}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 teaspoons/10 grams cumin seeds", "1 tablespoon/4 grams coriander seeds", "1 teaspoon/4 grams black peppercorns", "2 (2-inch/5-gram) cinnamon sticks, broken into pieces", "2 1/2 teaspoons/6 grams green cardamom pods", "1 1/2 teaspoons/2 grams whole allspice berries", "1 teaspoon/2 grams whole cloves", "1 whole nutmeg (2 grams)", "4 bay leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all the ingredients in a spice grinder, clean coffee grinder, or mortar and pestle, and grind until fine.
