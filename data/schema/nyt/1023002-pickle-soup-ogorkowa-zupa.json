Og\u00f3rkowa zupa fits perfectly into that tradition. There are as many variations as there are Polish cooks, but the key component \u2014 sour dill pickles \u2014 is always present. Here, the pickles are grated and gently cooked with garlic and bay leaves, then added along with their brine to a hearty blend of root vegetables in broth. In Polish households, soups usually start off most meals; the generous helping of vegetables in this version makes it a full meal. Serve with some good crusty bread, and feel free to add shredded chicken or even kielbasa if you\u2019d like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kasia Pilat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/24/dining/KP-pickle-soup/merlin_202658589_359082b4-3e84-43fa-978d-6212830fe5cf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "carrot, dill, pickles, potato, vegetable broth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 396}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 to 8 cups vegetable or chicken stock", "3 large carrots, peeled and coarsely grated", "3 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 small celery root, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1 medium parsnip, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "7 sour dill pickles (8 to 9 ounces) with 1 1/2 cups brine from the jar (see Tip)\u00a0", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped\u00a0", "3 dried bay leaves", "Salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup sour cream, for serving (optional)", "Chopped fresh dill, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, combine 6 cups stock with the carrots, potatoes, celery root and parsnip.
