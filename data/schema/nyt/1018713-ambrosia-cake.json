{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ambrosia Cake", "description": "If you love the combination of oranges, coconut and marshmallows found in a traditional ambrosia \u2014 the salad or dessert that often also contains pineapple, bananas, cherries and some kind of creamy dressing such as whipped cream or sour cream \u2014\u00a0you\u2019ll adore this cake. The coconut is baked into the cake layers and used as a sweet, shaggy garnish, while the oranges (in this case, diminutive, seedless clementines) are juiced into curd and sliced fresh for the filling. Then, as a final, fluffy touch, a homemade marshmallow frosting tops it off. It may be a lot of work, but it\u2019s an impressive result. And you can make the curd and cake a few days ahead. Just be sure to make the frosting and assemble everything within 8 hours of serving. Otherwise the fruit starts to break down and the icing may crystallize.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/12/dining/12APPE-SUB/12APPE-SUB-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes, project", "keywords": "clementines, coconut, coconut milk, rum, shredded coconut, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 392}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 3/4 cups/344 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters unsweetened coconut milk", "1 tablespoon coconut rum or dark rum (or use 1 teaspoon coconut extract)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened", "1/4 cup/59 milliliters virgin coconut oil, melted and cooled (or use more butter)", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams sugar", "4 large eggs, room temperature, whites and yolks separated", "1 1/4 teaspoons finely grated clementine zest (from about 2 clementines)", "1/3 cup/78 milliliters fresh clementine juice (from about 4 clementines), plus 2 1/2 teaspoons finely grated clementine zest", "1/3 cup/78 milliliters fresh lemon juice", "4 large eggs", "4 large egg yolks (reserve whites for frosting)", "7 tablespoons/88 grams sugar", "Pinch kosher salt", "12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), cubed", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "4 large egg whites", "1 cup/200 grams sugar", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "Pinch kosher salt", "8 to 10 seedless clementines", "1 1/2 to 3 cups/100 to 200 grams shredded sweetened or unsweetened coconut, to taste", "Strawberries, sliced (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees and place a rack in the middle.
