{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Spaghetti With Cherry Tomatoes and Kale", "description": "In this simple recipe, raw pasta and cherry tomatoes are simmered together in a single pan, cooking the pasta and forming a thick, starchy sauce at the same time. The efficient technique is internet famous, but this is the British cookbook author Anna Jones\u2019s vegetarian take on the phenomenon, adapted from her book \u201cA Modern Way to Cook.\u201d The technique is easy to master and endlessly adaptable: When you add the kale, you could also toss in a couple of anchovies and a generous pinch of red-pepper flakes. When you season and top with cheese, you could add a pile of fresh chopped herbs, like mint, basil or oregano.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/20/dining/one-pot-spaghetti-tomatoes-kale-horizontal/merlin_147983214_857dc6d1-c441-4253-a9c8-3f2c31343fcd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, weekday, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, kale, spaghetti, spinach, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2455}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 697, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "99 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "913 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound spaghetti", "1 pound cherry tomatoes, halved (about 2 pints)", "2 lemons, zested", "1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 bunch kale or spinach, leaves only, washed and chopped", "Black pepper", "Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring just over a quart of water to a boil.
