{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Mulligatawny Soup", "description": "This soup is the result of British colonizers\u2019 encounters with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/magazine/soup-so-vibrant-its-called-the-elixir-of-life.html\">rasam</a>, a souplike dish from Tamil Nadu, a region in southern India, that\u2019s often made with lentils. \u201cMilagu tannir,\u201d or pepper water, evolved into mulligatawny when the British made it thick, chunky and meaty. In her book \u201cFrom Curries to Kabobs,\u201d the author Madhur Jaffrey wrote that mulligatawny was \u201can essential part of my childhood,\u201d as she ate it at the homes of Anglo-Indian friends and in hotels on vacation. Mulligatawny now bears no resemblance to rasam and has many variations; it is a dish that was invented and modified for colonizers\u2019 palates, and thus it has few rules. Ms. Jaffrey noted that \u201csome curry powder has to be included for a true East-West flavor,\u201d as curry powder is more British than Indian. This slow-cooker version is thickened with masoor dal and coconut cream, and enriched with chicken thighs and tart apple.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/03/dining/sd-slow-cooker-mulligatawny/merlin_200566005_7b8a6794-84b3-4ab2-b5f5-ce5b890c61a9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, main course", "keywords": "apple, chicken thigh, coconut cream, curry powder, red lentils, slow cooker, soup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 654}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup vegetable oil", "8 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "2 carrots, peeled and sliced", "2 celery stalks, sliced", "1 large apple, preferably Granny Smith, peeled, cored and chopped", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size chunks", "1 cup masoor dal (split red lentils)", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 tablespoons minced ginger (from about 2 inches of peeled ginger)", "2 teaspoons black or brown mustard seeds", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon curry powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt, plus more to taste", "4 cups chicken broth or stock", "1 (5-ounce) can coconut cream (about \u2154 cup)", "Juice of 1 lime (about 1\u00bd tablespoons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all the ingredients except the coconut cream and lime juice in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker.
