You can serve this as a warming main course along with a crisp green salad, or as a rich and flavorful side dish to simple roasted meats or fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/27/dining/27apperex1/22apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice", "keywords": "gorgonzola, leek, polenta, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 534}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 350, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "578 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for pan", "1 quart chicken or vegetable stock, preferably homemade", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "1 cup polenta (coarse or regular, not instant)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "2 medium leeks, halved and sliced", "4 ounces Gorgonzola dolce or other creamy blue cheese, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 cup)", "Chopped parsley or basil, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and butter a 9-by-9-inch baking dish.
