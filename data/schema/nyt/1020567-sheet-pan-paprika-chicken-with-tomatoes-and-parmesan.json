{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Paprika Chicken With Tomatoes and Parmesan", "description": "This deeply savory, weeknight-friendly sheet-pan chicken is worth buying a new jar of sweet paprika for, especially if you can\u2019t remember when you got the one in your spice drawer (for those Fourth of July deviled eggs several summers ago?).The fresher the spices, the more intensely flavorful the dish. This one is as pretty as it is complex, with a mix of colorful cherry tomatoes and peppers that soften and absorb all the chicken juices as they roast. Serve it with something to catch the saucy tomatoes: Crusty bread, polenta or couscous all work well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/06/dining/01apperex/merlin_163287228_b349aad3-7d02-4918-8ec1-dc000603e8c5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, chicken, espelette pepper, parsley, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 669}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts (breasts, drumsticks, thighs or a mix)", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 1/2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, plus more for serving", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated", "1 tablespoon sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon Espelette pepper or smoked hot paprika (piment\u00f3n)", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 pint cherry tomatoes (preferably different colors), halved", "1 poblano chile or 1 small green bell pepper, thinly sliced", "1 cup thinly sliced sweet bell peppers (red, yellow or orange)", "1/3 cup grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, for serving", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
