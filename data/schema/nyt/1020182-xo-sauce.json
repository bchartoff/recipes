{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "XO Sauce", "description": "In Hong Kong in the 1980s, when expensive Cognac was all the rage, legend has it that some smart cook at the Spring Moon restaurant in the Peninsula Hotel on Kowloon got it into his head to name the funky new condiment he\u2019d come up with after the status mark on the bottle of Remy Martin at the bar: \u201cXO,\u201d extra old, rare, very expensive. The stuff was a hit: dried scallops and dried shrimp, a ton of chiles, a faint pork-smokiness and a whisper of allium, expensive to make and worth it for the flavor-enhancing pop. By the end of the decade, XO sauce was on menus all over Hong Kong and eventually the world. Recipes for XO vary wildly, save for those scallops and shrimp. Mine derives from the teachings of Diana Kuan, who included a formidable XO in her 2019 cookbook, \u201cRed Hot Kitchen.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/21/magazine/21mag-eat-slideshow-slide-XVL1/21mag-eat-slideshow-slide-XVL1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "2 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "asian, chinese", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "bacon, chiles, dried scallops, dried shrimp, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 385}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 123, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "294 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces dried scallops (ideally dinner-size)", "30 dried red chiles, like Japones, Tien Tsin or cayenne, tough stems removed, roughly chopped", "2 small jalape\u00f1o or Fresno chiles, roughly chopped", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped", "2 shallots, peeled and roughly chopped", "3 ounces medium dried shrimp", "2 ounces bacon, minced", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola", "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the scallops in a steamer insert, and fit the insert into a small pot with about an inch of water beneath the bottom of the insert.
