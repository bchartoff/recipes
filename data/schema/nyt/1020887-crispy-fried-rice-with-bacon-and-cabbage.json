{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Fried Rice With Bacon and Cabbage", "description": "This easy, hearty weeknight meal gets a lot of its brawny richness from just a small amount of bacon. The soft, wilted cabbage lends sweetness, while the kimchi (a nod toward <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018097-kimchi-fried-rice\">bokkeumbap</a>) zips things up. The secret to getting a crackling, crunchy texture is letting the rice sit in the hot oil without touching it until it browns, but using leftover rice also helps. (As the rice dries out, it crisps more easily.) If you\u2019re starting from scratch, just cook 2 cups of dry rice to yield the 6 cups of cooked rice called for here. Then spread the rice out on a baking sheet and let it cool and dehydrate a bit before frying. Be sure to have everything ready and near the stove when before you start. The cooking goes fast, and there won\u2019t be any time to prepare ingredients once you get going.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/26/dining/21Apperex1/merlin_169064598_1776eabb-8bdb-441a-95fa-b3c319822a8c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, grains and rice", "keywords": "bacon, cabbage, kimchi, rice, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 593}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or sunflower, plus more as needed", "3 slices thick-cut bacon, in 1/2-inch pieces (about 3 ounces)", "1 small bunch scallions, whites and greens separated, sliced", "4 cups shredded cabbage (from about 1/2 small head)", "Salt", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "6 cups cooked rice, white or brown, preferably day-old", "2 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce, plus more as needed", "1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup kimchi, drained and chopped, plus more for serving if you like", "1/2 cup green peas (thawed, if frozen)", "4 fried eggs, for serving (optional)", "Toasted sesame oil, for drizzling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high, heat 2 tablespoons oil until almost smoking.
