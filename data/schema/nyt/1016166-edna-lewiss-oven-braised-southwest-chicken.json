When the bird is cooked, its juices meld with the vegetables to make a thin sauce that can be thickened with cream. Hominy can be found in the canned-vegetables aisle of your supermarket.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Regina Schrambling"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 10}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 671, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "45 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1555 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 chicken, 2 1/2 to 3 pounds", "2 16-ounce cans yellow hominy (do not use white)", "1 medium onion, finely diced", "1 medium red or green bell pepper, seeded and finely diced", "1 small carrot, peeled and finely diced", "6 shiitake or domestic mushrooms, stems removed, caps diced", "3 to 4 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon oregano", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1  bay leaf", "1/3 cup dry vermouth", "1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro", "2 tablespoons heavy cream (optional)", "Salt to taste."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the chicken into serving pieces, or have the butcher do so.
