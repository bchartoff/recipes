Traditionally made from whole lemons, this version also incorporates blood oranges and cardamom, and it\u2019s a bright, welcome addition to the pecan and pumpkin desserts this time of year. Start it the day before by slicing the fruit and leaving it to sit in sugar overnight, then mix it with beaten eggs the next day. At home, Ms. Prueitt uses her tangy <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018414-cream-cheese-dough\">all-purpose cream cheese dough, which also happens to be gluten-free,</a> but you could use regular pie dough if you prefer.
