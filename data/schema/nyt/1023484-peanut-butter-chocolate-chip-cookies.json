{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peanut-Butter Chocolate-Chip Cookies", "description": "These superquick, easy cookies come together with just a few pantry ingredients, and no electric equipment required. They are gooey and chocolatey straight from the oven, but they stay chewy and fudgy for a few days on the counter. They call for organic brown sugar and vegan chocolate chips, but you can use their conventional counterparts if you aren\u2019t avoiding animal products. You can also use natural or conventional peanut butter, but cookies made with natural peanut butter will have a slightly nubbier texture. Use a ripe yellow banana for the strongest banana flavor; a speckly black one will result in sweeter cookies.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/29/dining/ya-peanut-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies/ya-peanut-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "20 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dessert", "keywords": "banana, chocolate chip, chocolate chip cookie, freezer friendly, make-ahead, peanut butter, peanut butter cookie, halloween, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 834}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/230 grams creamy peanut butter", "3/4 (packed) cup/150 grams organic light brown sugar", "1/2 cup/125 grams mashed ripe banana (from 1 large banana)", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 cup/64 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/170 grams vegan chocolate chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place two racks in the top and bottom thirds of your oven and heat to 350 degrees.
