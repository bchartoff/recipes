{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Shrimp and Corn With Lime Dressing", "description": "This bright, tangy, one-pan meal comes together quickly and is packed with bright flavors \u2014 perfect for a summer evening. If you can\u2019t find fresh corn, frozen will work in a pinch; just defrost it and pat it dry before throwing it into the skillet. You can also add a little more spice by leaving the ribs and seeds in the chile that goes into the dressing. Serve the shrimp and corn over rice or with a big green salad. Depending on what you serve this dish with, you may have a bit of dressing leftover, which can be saved for salad or drizzled over grilled meat or vegetables.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/20/dining/ya-shrimp-and-corn/merlin_189647448_3b87e02a-d760-424f-9763-6734c039433c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "corn, lime, shrimp, corn, skillet, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1767}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large shrimp (preferably tail-on), peeled and deveined", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice, plus 2 teaspoons lime zest, and 4 lime wedges (from 3 limes)", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced mint, plus a few mint leaves for garnish", "1 teaspoon honey", "1 garlic clove, finely minced", "1/2 Fresno chile, finely minced, seeds and ribs removed if desired", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3 cups fresh corn kernels (from about 4 ears)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the shrimp dry, then toss with the coriander and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.
