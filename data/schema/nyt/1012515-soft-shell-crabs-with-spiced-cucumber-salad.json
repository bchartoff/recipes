{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soft-Shell Crabs With Spiced Cucumber Salad", "description": "As we started tasting the German- and Czech-style American pilsners, Eric Asimov said he\u2019d like a hot dog.  No need to stop there. Spicy or fried foods, many kinds of seafood and fish, and barbecue suit these golden, refreshingly bitter beers.  I chose soft-shell crabs, crisped with an Indian-style chickpea-flour crust and served over spiced cucumbers. Buy the crabs alive, not frozen. Fish markets will take care of killing and cleaning them. Keep the crabs refrigerated and use them by the next day.The crabs are sold by size, but most markets do not offer choices. You will usually find the larger ones, called \u201cjumbos,\u201d which have bodies 5 to 5 1/2 inches across.  This recipe is designed for jumbos, with two per person as a main course or one each in a picnic-ready sandwich on a bun slathered with chili-fueled mayonnaise and layered with cucumber salad. Pour another brew and dig in.
