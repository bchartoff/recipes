{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Piccata", "description": "Chicken piccata is an Italian-American staple beloved for its piquant flavors cradled in a silky, butter-rich pan sauce. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that it cooks up very quickly. This version is mostly traditional except that it uses lemon two ways, calling for lemon slices to be caramelized (to soften their tang) and for a hit of fresh juice at the end (to brighten the whole dish). This ensures a sauce that's neither too rich, nor too puckery. Serve with a starch \u2014 pasta, polenta, rice or white beans \u2014 for sopping up the sauce, and a green vegetable.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/28/dining/as-chicken-piccata/as-chicken-piccata-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "capers, chicken breast, lemon, shallot, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1498}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 489, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "655 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\u00a0(about 1\u00bd pounds), halved horizontally (see tip)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "All-purpose flour, for dredging", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 shallot, peeled and sliced\u00a0lengthwise", "1 lemon, halved (half thinly sliced and seeds removed; half juiced, about 2 tablespoons)", "3/4 cup chicken stock", "4 teaspoons drained capers", "Coarsely chopped\u00a0fresh\u00a0parsley, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper.
