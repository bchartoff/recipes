Guests can scoop it out of a pretty glass bowl, but it\u2019s more fun to unmold it onto a cake plate and serve it in slices. Make sure the water your use to unmold your jelly is quite hot, not just warm. The idea is to melt the outer jelly layer just enough so that the whole mold can slip right out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/27/dining/27COOKING-CRANORGJELLY2/27COOKING-CRANORGJELLY2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "cranberry, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 131}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 184, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "3 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups Lillet (see note)", "1/2 cup orange liqueur, like Grand Marnier", "2 cups sugar", "2 tablespoons juniper berries (optional)", "2 12-ounce bags fresh or frozen cranberries (about 8 cups; frozen can be substituted)", "Nonstick cooking spray (if chilling in a mold)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a heavy saucepan, combine Lillet, liqueur, sugar and juniper berries if using.
