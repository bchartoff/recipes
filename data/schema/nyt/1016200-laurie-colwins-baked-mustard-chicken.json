{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Laurie Colwin\u2019s Baked Mustard Chicken", "description": "This old-school chicken, Sunday-night-supper chicken, even dinner party chicken, is baked for about two hours (yes, you read that correctly: two hours) until its bread crumb-coated skin is crisp \u2014 yet the meat miraculously maintains its moisture. The recipe, adapted from the great food writer Laurie Colwin, is so simple to make that her original version was written out in a brief paragraph, casually instructing the home cook to coat the chicken with mustard, garlic, a little thyme, a pinch of cinnamon. We have adapted the recipe to include measurements and more specific direction, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from absorbing her nonchalance and confidence as you make it, the certainty that it will turn out delicious every time.
