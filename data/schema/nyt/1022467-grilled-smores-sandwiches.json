{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled S\u2019mores Sandwiches", "description": "This always-makes-you-happy dessert combines two classics: <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/992-indoor-smores\">s\u2019mores</a> and pan con chocolate, a Spanish snack of toast with melted chocolate on top. Oozy chocolate and wobbly marshmallows are sandwiched between two slices of crisp, slightly smoky pieces of bread. While you could use any white or whole wheat sandwich bread, cinnamon bread is the ideal way to go. Not only will the toasty cinnamon flavor remind you of graham crackers, but also the sugar will help the bread caramelize on the grill (and a surprising slick of mayonnaise, instead of butter, helps brown the bread without burning). To keep the sandwich from being cloyingly sweet, add a sprinkle of salt on top. (P.S. Make it a Fluffernutter by using peanut butter instead of chocolate.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/10/dining/as-smores-sandwiches/as-smores-sandwiches-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches, dessert", "keywords": "bread, chocolate, marshmallow", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 158}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 slices cinnamon swirl bread (with or without raisins)", "Mayonnaise", "4 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate bars, broken into roughly 1-ounce pieces", "8 marshmallows, torn in half", "Flaky or kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for medium-low heat.
