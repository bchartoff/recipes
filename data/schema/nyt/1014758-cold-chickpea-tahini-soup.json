Dried chickpeas take longer to cook than other beans (two hours is a likely cooking time); use enough water, and the process is stress-free.\n\nOne major benefit to cooking chickpeas yourself \u2014 aside from the superior flavor and texture \u2014 is that the water you cook them in becomes particularly rich and flavorful by the time they\u2019re done.
