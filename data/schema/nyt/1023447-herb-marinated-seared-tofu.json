{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herb-Marinated Seared Tofu\u00a0", "description": "Pan-seared tofu, torn into chunks then soaked in a bright, herby sauce, makes a great addition to many meals: Pile it on top of grains, salad greens, noodles or yogurt; tuck it into a pita; or toss it with chunks of roasted squash. The herbs and seasonings used in this sauce can shift, depending on what you have on hand and what sounds good. Add capers, anchovies or olives for brininess; or harissa, fresh chile or ginger for spice. You can even use wilted herbs and hearty greens. For additional texture, add nuts and seeds, or tomatoes, thinly sliced celery or avocado. Eat it right away or refrigerate for another day. It\u2019s a practical yet vibrant dish that you\u2019ll make on repeat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/08/dining/as-herby-tofu/as-herby-tofu-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, lunch, weeknight, beans, main course", "keywords": "block tofu, extra-firm tofu, make-ahead, parsley, shallot, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 676}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons finely chopped shallot (from 1 small shallot)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice or red or white wine vinegar, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/2 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 (14- to 16-ounce) block extra-firm tofu, sliced 1/2-inch thick and patted dry", "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley (see Tip)", "1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro, mint, dill, chives, chervil, celery leaves, fennel or carrot tops, or a mix", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme, oregano, marjoram or tarragon leaves (optional)", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, stir together the shallot, lemon juice and a pinch of salt; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high.
