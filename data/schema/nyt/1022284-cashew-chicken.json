{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cashew Chicken", "description": "Cashew chicken dishes have long been a classic of American Chinese cuisine. But Andrew Chiou and Tim Ma, the co-owners of Lucky Danger in Washington, D.C., have noticed it fading from menus in the area. According to Mr. Chiou, the dish is all about textural contrast: the crisp, battered chicken that\u2019s been tossed in a thin, sweet-and-savory sauce; crisp-tender vegetables like celery, as well as softer straw mushrooms; and, of course, the satisfying crunch of cashews. Their version is similar to the famous, deep-fried cashew chicken dish popularized by the chef David Leong in Springfield, Mo., in the 1960s. Enjoy it alongside other dishes as part of a multicourse meal, or just with steamed rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Cathy Erway"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/23/dining/21takeoutrex2/merlin_188667759_0d3ffc90-374a-44ec-aae9-467d0f12f396-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "cashew, chicken thigh, cornstarch, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 447}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1/3 cup cornstarch", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine", "1/2 cup cornstarch", "1/3 cup all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/8 teaspoon baking soda", "2 cups canola or peanut oil", "1/2 yellow onion, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1/2 cup)", "1 small carrot, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice", "1 celery stalk, cut into 1-inch dice", "4 ounces (drained) canned whole water chestnuts or peeled jicama, cut into \u00bd-inch dice", "2 ounces (drained) canned whole straw mushrooms", "1 tablespoon minced rehydrated garlic (or 4 fresh garlic cloves, minced)", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "1 tablespoon oyster sauce", "1 cup whole roasted cashews", "1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water", "1 teaspoon sesame oil", "1 pinch MSG (optional), such as Aji-No-Moto brand seasoning", "Steamed rice (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine the chicken, batter ingredients and 2 tablespoons water.
