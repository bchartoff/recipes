{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Minestrone With Giant White Beans and Winter Squash", "description": "The inspiration for this minestrone was a bag of Rancho Gordo Royal Corona beans that I have had in my pantry for a while. Royal Coronas are large white European runner beans that are similar to Greek gigandes but bigger, richer and sturdier. They are about twice the size of a lima bean and, unlike many other large white beans, the skin doesn\u2019t slip off when you soak them. If you substitute limas I would not soak the beans, but if you use the Royal Coronas, do soak them to shorten the cooking time. The beans are downright meaty and the soup is a hearty one. I didn\u2019t even feel the need to add pasta or rice to this substantial minestrone.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/10/science/recipehealthminestrone/recipehealthminestrone-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 generous servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 542}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 211, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1321 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ounces (1 cup) giant white beans such as Royal Coronas, gigandes (giant white beans), or large dried limas, washed, picked over and soaked for 4 hours or longer (no need to soak limas or large white beans)", "1/2 medium onion", "1 bay leaf", "2 quarts water", "Salt to taste", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "1 large or 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced (1/2 inch dice or smaller if desired)", "1 celery stalk, diced", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley", "1 or 2 leeks, white and light green parts only, halved, cleaned well and sliced thin", "3 or 4 garlic cloves (to taste), minced", "1 14-ounce can chopped tomatoes, with juice", "A bouquet garni made with a Parmesan rind, a bay leaf and a couple of sprigs each parsley and thyme, tied into one of the leek leaves if desired", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 pound winter squash, diced", "Lots of chopped flat leaf parsley or basil (or both)", "Freshly grated Parmesan for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "First simmer beans.
