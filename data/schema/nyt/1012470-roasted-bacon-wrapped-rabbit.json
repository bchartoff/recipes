Quickly rinse the spices off the rabbit with cold water. Blot the pieces completely dry with paper towels, then blot the bacon dry. Wrap each rabbit piece in a slice of bacon and place them seam-side down on a rimmed baking sheet or in a shallow roasting pan or a large ovenproof skillet. (The flat pieces below the rabbit\u2019s ribs, known as the flap, can be rolled up and then wrapped.) Roast until the bacon crisps and the rabbit is no longer pink, 25 to 30 minutes. It is impossible to imagine this as anything other than finger food (maybe with some roasted potatoes)."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012470-roasted-bacon-wrapped-rabbit"}
