{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Risotto With Kale and Red Beans", "description": "I\u2019m always on the lookout for vegetables with red pigments, a good sign of anthocyanins, those beneficial flavonoids that are known for antioxidant properties and are present in purple and red vegetables. When you cook the kale with the rice, the red in the kale dyes the rice pale pink (the kale goes to a kind of drab green). The first time I made it, without the red beans, the finished product reminded me of the way the rice looks when I make red beans with rice. So I decided to add red beans to the mix, which provide a healthy dose of protein and fiber, as well as color.
