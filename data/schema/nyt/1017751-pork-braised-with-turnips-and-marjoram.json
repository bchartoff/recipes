{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pork Braised With Turnips and Marjoram", "description": "In assembling this rather straightforward pork ragout, my main question was how to produce a sauce with substantial consistency, considering I had not planned to use any flour or other thickener. I thought that finely diced apple, which would melt into the sauce, might do the trick. It did, though also mincing the shallots meant that they, too, would add body. Pork shoulder, called butt for some reason, is the best cut for slow-cooking. It will have fat, which is to its advantage in terms of flavor and texture, and is a component that can be trimmed and put to practical use to start the cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/dining/21PAIRING/21PAIRING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "apple, pork shoulder, sherry, turnip, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 44}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 446, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "797 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds pork shoulder (pork butt)", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon five-spice powder", "\u00bd teaspoon hot paprika, preferably Hungarian", "Ground black pepper", "Salt", "\u00bd cup minced shallots", "1 medium-size apple, peeled, cored and minced", "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "\u00bd cup oloroso or amontillado sherry", "1 \u00bd cup chicken stock, more as needed", "1 pound medium-size white turnips (about 4), peeled and quartered", "1 \u00bd tablespoons marjoram leaves", "\u00bd tablespoon fresh thyme leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim off excess fat from the pork; dice and reserve it.
