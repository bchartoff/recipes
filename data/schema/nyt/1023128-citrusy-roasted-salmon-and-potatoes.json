Skin-on Yukon Golds are thinly sliced, fanned out and generously drizzled with a citrus sauce to serve as the base for the meal. The salmon is placed directly on top of the potatoes after they\u2019re briefly roasted, the fish is drizzled with more sauce, then everything roasts together until the salmon is tender and the potatoes are perfectly cooked through and irresistibly tangy. Feel free to swap out the cilantro for any fresh herb you prefer, such as dill or parsley.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/13/dining/nd-citrusy-roasted-salmon-and-potatoes/merlin_205030785_062bb7eb-5631-4979-b014-7edc33e93384-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings\u00a0", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, seafood, main course", "keywords": "clementines, potato, salmon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 978}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/3 cup fresh clementine or mandarin juice, plus 1 clementine or mandarin, sliced into \u00bc-inch-thick rounds, for garnish", "1/4 cup fresh lime juice\u00a0", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 shallot, chopped", "2 large garlic cloves, finely grated", "2 large Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 pound)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Red-pepper flakes, to taste", "1 1/2 pounds skin-on salmon fillet (preferably 1 single center-cut piece)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine the olive oil, clementine or mandarin juice, lime juice, cilantro, shallot and garlic; set aside citrus sauce.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Scrub the potatoes and slice them into \u00bc-inch-thick rounds.
