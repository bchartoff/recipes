{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi Jjigae With Ribs", "description": "The world of bubbling jjigaes, or stews, is vast and varied. The most beloved might be kimchi jjigae, a pot of extra-fermented kimchi boiled in its own juices until mellowed and yielding. Pork belly, Spam and tofu are common protein additions, as are tuna and mackerel pike. In this version, baby back ribs lend both flavor and body to the broth and are fun to eat with your hands. In case your kimchi is less than ripe (it should taste sharp and funky), a couple of seasonings help fortify this jjigae\u2019s flavor: Fish sauce adds savory depth, and maesil cheong (green plum syrup) lends rounded sweetness. And though watercress is not a traditional ingredient in kimchi jjigae, it is a favorite addition to this family recipe.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/30/dining/30motherrex/merlin_186774930_f70cdae6-2782-44db-98fb-4683814160f2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "baby back ribs, kimchi", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 394}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 rack baby back ribs (about 1 1/2 pounds), sliced into individual ribs", "1 (3-inch) piece ginger, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch slices", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon gochugaru (see Tips), plus more to taste", "4 large garlic cloves, minced", "2 packed cups coarsely chopped ripe kimchi (about 1 pound), plus any accumulated juices", "Kosher salt", "1 medium yellow onion, halved and cut into 1/4-inch slices\u00a0", "1 tablespoon fish sauce, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon maesil cheong (green plum syrup; see Tips), plus more to taste", "1 packed cup watercress, leaves and tender stems, for serving (from 1 small bunch; optional)", "Cooked white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the ribs and ginger in a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot and cover with cold tap water.
