{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Mint, Basil and Fresh Mozzarella", "description": "In this green pasta dish, basil, mint, Parmesan and garlic are blended into a smooth pesto-like sauce, then tossed with pasta, creamy mozzarella and crunchy pine nuts just before serving. Marinating the mozzarella in some of the sauce as the pasta cooks imbues the mild cheese with flavor, and allows it to start softening so it melts in contact with the pasta. Serve this hot or warm, when the cheese is supple and a little runny.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/19/dining/19APPE1/19APPE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "basil, mint, mozzarella, pasta, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 739}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 785, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "417 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup pine nuts", "2/3 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish", "4 cups fresh basil leaves, plus more torn leaves for garnish", "1 cup fresh mint leaves, plus more torn leaves for garnish", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, or to taste", "Pinch red chile flakes", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "8 ounces fresh bocconcini or mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "12 ounces pasta, such as campanelle or fusilli", "Coarsely ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small skillet over medium heat, toast pine nuts, shaking the pan frequently, until golden, about 3 minutes.
