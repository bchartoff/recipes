There\u2019s a nice contrast of textures going on, with the crunchy fennel, soft beets and juicy oranges. The dish has Moroccan overtones, with the combination of oranges and beets, and the cumin in the dressing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/23/science/25recipehealthorange/25recipehealthorange-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 178}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 139, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "399 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium beets, roasted peeled, halved and cut in thin half-moons", "2 medium fennel bulbs (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds), trimmed, quartered, cored  and sliced very thin across the grain", "1 navel orange, peeled, pith cut away, and cut in thin rounds or sections", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint", "1 tablespoon chopped cilantro", "2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice", "1/4 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon lightly toasted cumin seeds, crushed", "Salt to taste", "1 small garlic clove, pur\u00e9ed (optional)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine beets, fennel, orange slices or medallions, mint and cilantro in a large salad bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together lemon or lime juice, sugar, cumin, salt, optional garlic and olive oil.
