Decades ago, many businesses decided to prioritize cookie-cutter-like hybrid tomatoes, which grow year-round and can survive a long, bumpy journey. It left heirloom tomatoes on the wrong side of the deal. The varieties that remain have a shorter shelf life and are relegated to just a few months of summer, but they\u2019re sweeter with a more robust flavor. This tart celebrates juicy, vibrant tomatoes in a cheesy, herby, custard-filled, flaky crust, with each bite punctuated with pesto.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/20/dining/17Tartrex/merlin_174651783_cd14fa9e-f2e3-4393-a61f-5aad5774497a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, pies and tarts, main course", "keywords": "basil, heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella, pesto, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3544}, "recipeIngredient": ["Dough for a <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-all-butter-pie-crust\">9-inch single crust pie</a>, or use store-bought, rolled into an 11-inch round (see Note)", "1 1/2 pounds\u00a0ripe\u00a0heirloom tomatoes (about 4 medium)", "1/4 cup store-bought pesto", "3/4 cup shredded mozzarella (about 3 ounces)", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh basil", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano", "3 large eggs", "1/3 cup heavy cream", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
