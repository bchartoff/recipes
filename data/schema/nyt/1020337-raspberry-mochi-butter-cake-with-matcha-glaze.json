{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Raspberry-Mochi Butter Cake With Matcha Glaze", "description": "This cake elicits awe on sight, and it\u2019s a delightfully easy stir-and-bake dessert created by Margarita Manzke, the pastry chef and an owner at R\u00e9publique, a restaurant and bakery in Los Angeles. Dense and chewy, mochi is a popular Japanese confection made from glutinous, sticky rice. It\u2019s typically formed into pocket-size balls or squares but can also be made into cakes. As the rice flour batter comes together, it may seem gritty, but it will soak up the coconut milk and evaporated milk and soften as it bakes. Unlike many cakes baked with traditional flour, this gluten-free cake is so rich and moist that it\u2019s hard to overbake. For the glaze, matcha powder is combined with confectioners\u2019 sugar and coconut milk, which gives the cake an earthy tone, but you could easily swap in freeze-dried raspberry or strawberry powder.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/09/dining/aw-raspberry-mochi-butter-cake/merlin_157389087_717f1c45-cc83-4ec3-a40e-53e66bc1b388-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "coconut milk, evaporated milk, glutinous rice flour, matcha, raspberries, dessert, gluten-free, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 344}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 1/4 cups/315 grams glutinous rice flour, like Mochiko brand (see Tip)", "1 3/4 cups/365 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters full-fat coconut milk", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters evaporated milk", "2 large eggs", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "12 ounces/340 grams fresh raspberries", "2 cups/280 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more for dusting", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/80 milliliters full-fat coconut milk", "2 teaspoons matcha powder"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
