{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nonalcoholic Smoky Citrus Punch", "description": "Historically, punch is an alcoholic drink, made with a spirit, sugar, citrus and spice, but this variation drops the spirit and doubles down on its other central components. Opting for smoky Lapsang souchong adds distinctive depth and character to the punch, though another black tea, such as Earl Grey or Darjeeling or a more robust green tea, can also be used. Likewise, the oranges in the lemon-orange oleo-saccharum (a muddled sugar and citrus mixture) can be swapped out for seasonal citrus, such as satsuma, mandarin or blood oranges. Bear in mind you need to start this punch the day before serving: While some of the tea is brewed hot before being added to the lemon-orange oleo-saccharum, cold-brewing the remainder of the tea ensures that the final punch is deeply flavored, smooth drinking and more nuanced than astringent. A mix of tonic and soda water to finish imbues the punch with a bubbly, quinine bitterness and helps to balance the tannins of the tea.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/07/dining/01punchrex3-noabv/merlin_216830940_6545f6a8-187a-41ce-8949-3c4350a6b037-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT11H20M", "recipeYield": "18 to 20 (4-ounce) drinks", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks, punches", "keywords": "black tea, lemon, mocktail, orange, party, plan-ahead, sugar, christmas, hanukkah, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 181}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 lemons, plus more for juicing as needed", "2 oranges", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "4 bags Lapsang souchong tea (or use 4 teaspoons loose-leaf)", "1 cup/8 ounces soda water", "1 cup/8 ounces tonic water", "Lemon and orange slices, for serving", "Ice ring or block, for serving (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before serving, peel the lemons and oranges.
