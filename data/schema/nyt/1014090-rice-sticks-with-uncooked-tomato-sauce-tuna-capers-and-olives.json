{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Sticks With Uncooked Tomato Sauce, Tuna, Capers and Olives", "description": "Now you can buy brown rice noodles that are made of whole grains and contain four grams of fiber per serving; regular rice sticks contain anywhere from 0 to 0.7 grams of fiber per serving (check your packaging to see). Brown rice noodles look just like the regular rice noodles and are just as easy to prepare, but taste a little nuttier. This is a great way to use the last of your summer tomatoes. Because rice sticks don\u2019t get soggy, the dish won\u2019t suffer if it sits, so you could serve this as a cold pasta salad. It\u2019s good either way, hot or cold.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/28/science/27recipehealth/27recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 288, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "511 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ripe, locally grown tomatoes", "1 to 2 garlic cloves, green shoots removed, finely chopped or pur\u00e9ed", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 teaspoon balsamic or sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "1 5-ounce can water-packed light tuna, drained and broken up with a fork, or 5 to 6 ounces cooked fresh tuna, cut in thin bite-size pieces", "1 tablespoon capers, rinsed", "10 imported black olives, halved and pitted", "2 tablespoons slivered basil leaves", "7 to 8 ounces thin rice sticks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Begin heating a large pot of water.
