Here it is front and center in a main-dish salad, especially satisfying with a poached egg or some charcuterie on the side. Buy full green heads of celery, not the pale hearts, and make sure the leaves are still attached. But if you can\u2019t find celery with leaves, chopped parsley is a reasonable substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/04/dining/04KNIVES-SALAD1SUB1/04KNIVES-SALAD1SUB1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H40M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "basil, celery, chickpea, parmigiano-reggiano, romaine, scallion, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 614}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 330, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "651 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons sherry vinegar, more as needed", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1/2 teaspoon maple syrup or honey", "Salt and ground black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "4 cups cooked or canned chickpeas", "4 large or 6 small celery stalks, trimmed (reserve the leaves) and cut into large julienne", "2 large scallions, white and pale green parts, thinly sliced on a diagonal, or 1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion", "1 to 2 cups loosely packed celery leaves, coarsely chopped", "1 pint small tomatoes, halved", "1/4 cup loosely packed basil leaves, rolled and julienned", "2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, coarsely grated, or crumbled feta", "1 small loaf (or 1/2 large loaf)\u00a0day-old, peasant-style crusty bread", "Romaine or butterhead lettuce, endive or escarole, cut or torn into bite-size leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, mustard, maple syrup and a large pinch each of salt and pepper.
