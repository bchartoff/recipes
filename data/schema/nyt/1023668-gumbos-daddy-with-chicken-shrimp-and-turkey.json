Ms. Jennings spikes the soup with a mix of curry powder and <a href=\"https://www.kingspepper.com/\">King\u2019s Pepper</a>, a spice blend that she developed based on a West African recipe. But any chile powder, including cayenne, can be substituted. Add it to taste; Ms. Jennings and her family like it fiery hot, then served over rice to mitigate the burn.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/23/dining/22apperex2-gumbo/merlin_216459888_d16bc586-3a4a-4945-8b54-e675a9e7832b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "chicken wing, collard greens, shrimp, soul food, soup, thanksgiving leftover, turkey, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 98}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 to 1 1/4 pound chicken wings", "1 1/4 teaspoons fine salt, plus more as needed", "1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon chile powder, such as King\u2019s Pepper, plus more to taste (or use cayenne pepper)", "3 cups chicken or turkey stock or water, plus more as needed", "1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce", "1 small red onion, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup chopped red, yellow or orange bell pepper", "1 habanero or Scotch bonnet chile, seeded (optional)", "2 tablespoons curry powder", "1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1/4 cup olive or vegetable oil", "1 (15-ounce) can collard greens (with their liquid) or 1 large bunch collard greens, stems removed, leaves torn into bite-size pieces", "2 cups chopped or shredded leftover turkey", "1 to 2 turkey bones (optional)", "1 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined and cut into 1-inch pieces", "Cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken wings dry with paper towels.
