{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oysters Rockefeller", "description": "There are as many so-called original recipes for oysters Rockefeller as there are types of oysters. One account has it that the dish first surfaced at Antoine\u2019s in New Orleans in 1899. It was said to have been devised by Jules Alciatore, a grandson of the restaurant\u2019s founders. According to the story, a shortage of snails from Europe had the restaurant in jitters, and Mr. Alciatore was experimenting in the kitchen, looking for a substitute. At that time, oysters were never cooked at all, let alone fancied up with a sauce. He did so, making a sauce of watercress, scallions, celery, anise, spinach and other seasonings. It was a big hit, and he named it after America\u2019s richest man, John D. Rockefeller. Some revisionists contend that spinach was not in the original dish. My version calls for celery, spinach, scallions, parsley, garlic, anchovy fillets and Tabasco. The anchovy is my own liberal interpretation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, oyster, seafood", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 16}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 564, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "37 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "1199 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["24 oysters", "1 lb. fresh spinach", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped celery", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped scallions", "1/2 cup chopped parsley", "1 clove garlic", "2 anchovy fillets", "4 tablespoons butter", "2 tablespoons flour", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese", "2 tablespoons Ricard or Pernod", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Open the oysters, leaving them on the half shell, and reserve the oyster liquor.
