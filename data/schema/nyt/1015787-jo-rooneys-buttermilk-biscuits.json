This recipe comes from an early mentor of mine, Mrs. Jo Rooney, a wonderful home cook I met years ago in Bakersfield, Calif. Rather than double the recipe, she always said it was better to make another batch while the first one was baking. Also, that way there&rsquo;s a constant flow of hot biscuits.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/11/dining/11KITCH2COMBO/11KITCH2COMBO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "16 to 18 biscuits", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, quick", "keywords": "biscuits, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 137}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 113, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "108 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["260 grams all-purpose flour (about 2 cups)", "8 grams baking powder (2 teaspoons)", "1 1/2 grams baking soda (1/2 teaspoon)", "3 grams kosher salt (1 teaspoon)", "6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, lard or shortening", "1 cup buttermilk ", "3 tablespoons melted butter, for brushing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
