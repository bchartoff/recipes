{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffed Sweet Peppers With Tuna, Bulgur and Herbs", "description": "Small, sweet bell peppers (also called mini peppers) in shades of red, orange and green make attractive vessels for stuffing. In this recipe, adapted from the home cook Meline Toumani, they\u2019re roasted until caramelized, then filled with a mixture of bulgur, tuna, herbs and capers for brightness. Offer these to nibble with cocktails when you\u2019re feeding a crowd, or serve them with a salad and some warm pita bread for a light but highly flavorful supper for a smaller group. Be sure to use the best-quality tuna you can get here; tuna packed in olive oil (rather than water or other types of oil) is generally richer and better tasting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/18/dining/18appetite1/18appetite1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean, turkish", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bell pepper, bulgur, jalape\u00f1o, tuna", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 162}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 356, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "820 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds sweet small bell peppers, cored (about 24)", "6 tablespoons olive oil, more as needed", "1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea salt, more as needed", "1 cup medium or coarse bulgur", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 cups chicken or vegetable stock or water", "1/2 cup diced celery", "1/2 cup diced onion", "1/2 cup diced green bell pepper", "1 medium or 2 small jalape\u00f1os, seeded and minced", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "2 chopped anchovy filets (optional)", "Black pepper, to taste", "1 (5- to 7-ounce) jar of tuna packed in olive oil, drained", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise or plain Greek-style yogurt", "2 tablespoons lemon juice, more to taste", "1/3 cup chopped cilantro", "1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley, mint or dill (or a combination), more for garnish", "2 1/2 tablespoons capers"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
