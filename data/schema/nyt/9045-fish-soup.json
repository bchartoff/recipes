{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fish Soup", "description": "Ms. Hodgson brought us this recipe over 20 years ago in an article that extolled the virtues of halibut, and indeed, it is very good fish for soups. Here, fish and shellfish are briefly cooked in a saffron-flavored broth. \n\nDon't be intimidated. This recipe is extremely simple, and once you've gathered all of the ingredients (perhaps the most time-consuming of all the tasks), it can be put together in about an hour. It can also be made in advance, with the fish cooked in the broth at the last minute. Serve it with our version of rouille (a thick garlicky sauce stirred in after the soup is served) that uses a couple of tablespoons of commercial mayonnaise instead of egg yolks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Moira Hodgson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/29/dining/fish-soup/fish-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "times classics", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, fall, halibut, shrimp, squid", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 95}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 684, "unsaturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1252 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound shrimp, with shells on", "1/2 pound squid, cleaned", "1/2 pound halibut", "1 piece monkfish (about 1/2 pound)", "Lemon juice", "2 tablespoons parsley", "Fish heads and bones as available", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large leek, sliced", "2 carrots, sliced", "1 clove garlic, minced", "4 ripe tomatoes skinned and chopped, or canned tomatoes, chopped", "Pinch saffron", "1 glass dry white wine", "4 thick slices white or light whole wheat bread, crusts removed", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1 teaspoon paprika", "1 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1/3 to 1/2 cup olive oil", "Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Shell the shrimp and put the shells in a stockpot.
