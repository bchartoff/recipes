This miyeok guk (ME-yuhk gewk) forgoes the more common beef broth for mussels and an aromatic base of onion, garlic and anchovies. Though not traditional, the addition of parsnip, for sweetness and umami, yields a broth with body, like the kind you would get with the usual brisket. Scooped out of their shells, mussels become little morsels in the soup, nuggets of briny joy.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/15/dining/15ESSENTIALSrex4/15ESSENTIALSrex4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, seafood, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "miyeok, mussels, seaweed", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh mussels", "20 grams miyeok, often labeled as dried seaweed, crushed into small pieces (about 3/4 cup)", "4 oil-packed anchovies plus 1 tablespoon anchovy oil", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "1 small onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1 small parsnip, peeled, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise into half-moons", "7 garlic cloves, crushed and coarsely chopped", "Salt", "3 tablespoons fish sauce", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "Steamed white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the mussels and seaweed: Put on a kettle of water to boil.
