{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Cider and Bourbon Punch", "description": "Apples and oranges! They\u2019re often presented as exemplars of opposition, as though they have nothing in common. But both fruits make appearances on many Thanksgiving tables, with orange in some cranberry sauces and cornbread stuffings with apple, and they mingle beautifully in a mellow punch that gets its verve from bourbon and its depth from a brown sugar and cinnamon simple syrup. For extra apple flavor, try swapping an apple spirit, such as Applejack or Calvados, in for the bourbon. The leftover simple syrup is great in cocktails -- a festive Old Fashioned, for example -- and also on oatmeal and rice pudding.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/13/dining/rs-thanksgiving-punch/rs-thanksgiving-punch-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "\u00a014 6-ounce servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "apple cider, bourbon, cinnamon stick, dark brown sugar, orange juice, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 204}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 227, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "17 milligrams", "sugarContent": "25 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dark brown sugar", "2 cinnamon sticks, slightly bruised", "1/2 cup brown sugar and cinnamon syrup", "3 cups bourbon", "4 cups cold-pressed apple cider (nonalcoholic)", "1/2 cup fresh lemon juice", "1/2 cup orange juice (fresh is best)", "4 cups ice", "2 cups club soda, or to taste", "1 orange, cut into wheels, for garnish (optional)", "Nutmeg, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the syrup: In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar and cinnamon sticks with 1 cup water, and bring to a boil.
