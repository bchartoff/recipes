{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken With Bitter Herb Pesto", "description": "The goal was compatibility with Israeli white and red wines and also with a Passover Seder menu. It was a simple one, achieved with dark meat chicken, which goes with either choice and can stand up to slow cooking. I made a pesto with escarole. Among Ashkenazi Jews the bitter herb, or maror, on the ceremonial Seder plate is usually horseradish. But for Sephardic Jews, it is usually a green vegetable like escarole, which Ashkenazi Jews may sometimes include. I spread the pesto on the boned thighs, then enclosed the filling. Matzo meal encouraged a golden crust. The chicken needs no tending during the Seder service. It's a good idea to pray for leftovers, because the chicken, sliced into rounds, is delicious for lunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/10/dining/10COOKING-MATZOMEAL/10COOKING-MATZOMEAL-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "kosher, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 367, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "569 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 clove garlic, peeled", "1/3 cup toasted pine nuts", "1/3 cup dried currants", "1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped escarole leaves", "2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley", "Salt and black pepper", "3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, about 12", "5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup matzo meal", "1 cup chicken stock", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Turn on food processor and drop garlic through feed tube.
