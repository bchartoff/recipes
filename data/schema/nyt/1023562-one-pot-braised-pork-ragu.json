There\u2019s only about 15 minutes of active work; the oven does the rest. Pork shoulder (also known as picnic shoulder) is a relatively inexpensive cut of pork that takes well to braising, which yields super flavorful and tender meat.

The versatile rag\u00f9 can be served over pasta or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014527-basic-polenta\">polenta</a>, and leftovers easily turn into craveable sandwiches the next day. The recipe is easily doubled and freezes extremely well, if you\u2019d like to cook once and eat twice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/20/multimedia/kc-baked-pork-ragu-1-09cd/kc-baked-pork-ragu-1-09cd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, sauces and gravies, main course", "keywords": "canned tomato, dutch oven, freezer friendly, heavy cream, make-ahead, one pot, pork shoulder, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 594}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound pork shoulder, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "3 medium carrots, peeled and finely chopped (1\u00bd cups)", "1 medium yellow onion, diced into small pieces (1\u00bd cups)", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes", "1 fresh rosemary sprig", "2 fresh basil sprigs, plus chopped leaves for garnish", "1/4 cup heavy cream", "Cooked pasta or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014527-basic-polenta\">polenta</a>, for serving", "Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium.
