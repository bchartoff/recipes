For reasons of habit, taste or happenstance, I started making it with duck instead. It seems like a lot of work \u2014 two species, a fancy sauce \u2014 but a lot of the cooking is unattended, and the sauce, you\u2019ll see, is quite easy to pull off, at least the second time you try. The resulting meal is excessive and fantastic. It begs for a watercress salad with a bright, acidic dressing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/24/magazine/24mag-eat1/24mag-24eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "duck, scallops", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 54}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 4- to 6-pound duck", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "Barbecue sauce or hoisin sauce, to taste", "7 egg yolks, at room temperature", "1 cup unsalted butter", "Pinch cayenne, or to taste", "1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste", "Salt, to taste", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 pound sea scallops, patted dry", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1 tablespoon dry white vermouth or white wine", "1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the duck.
