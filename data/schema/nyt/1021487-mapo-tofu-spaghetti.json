For velvety results, select silken tofu that\u2019s molded into its refrigerated tub. Shop at a Chinese market for the doubanjiang (fermented chile bean sauce or paste). Look for the kind that is jarred and labeled as toban djan or packaged as plastic-sealed paper cubes, and originating from Pixian. Also grab some Sichuan peppercorns, and for extra umami oomph, some douchi (fermented black beans), too. If beef or pork isn\u2019t your thing, try ground turkey, lamb or a plant-based meat alternative. Chefs (Mei Lin of Nightshade in Los Angeles, and Yu Bo of Yu\u2019s Family Kitchen in Chengdu) and home cooks (the family of Zhong Yi, a former graduate student at Sichuan University) alike have tinkered with mapo tofu, pushing its definition and inspiring this cross-cultural iteration.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Andrea Nguyen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/07/dining/05mapo2/merlin_177593271_16f2d766-e655-44bc-a88f-afa8e95c5b81-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, noodles, pastas, main course", "keywords": "doubanjiang, ginger, ground beef, parmesan, scallion, sichuan peppercorns, spaghetti, tofu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 468}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14- or 16-ounce) package silken tofu", "1 1/2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola oil", "8 ounces ground beef or pork (preferably 80 or 85 percent lean), roughly chopped to loosen", "2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons doubanjiang (fermented chile bean sauce or paste)", "1 tablespoon douchi (fermented black beans, optional)", "1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "2 teaspoons regular soy sauce", "1 rounded teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more as needed", "Fine sea salt", "1 large scallion, trimmed and sliced on a sharp bias into 2-inch-long pieces", "1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons water", "1 tablespoon fine sea salt", "12 ounces dried spaghetti", "1 large scallion, trimmed and cut on a sharp bias into 2-inch-long pieces", "2 to 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the mapo tofu sauce: If the tofu came as a block in water, discard the water.
