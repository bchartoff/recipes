{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Guacamole", "description": "Providing a framework to build on as you wish, this pared-down guacamole lets the avocado shine. If you want more lime, add more lime. Seed the jalape\u00f1o, if you prefer its fruity heat without the spice, or leave the seeds in, if you enjoy living life on the edge. Letting the diced onion sit in lime juice for a couple of minutes will help temper its pungent bite before imbuing the dish with its oniony savoriness. Chopped cilantro and diced tomatoes are welcome additions to this Mexican staple, if you\u2019d like. It\u2019s your guacamole. Serve with tortilla chips, or as a condiment alongside your meal, and double or triple this recipe for a party.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/22/dining/21beginner-rex1/merlin_208160622_52e89e7b-f828-452a-8da3-8edf706952ed-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 cups (4 appetizer servings)", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, condiments, dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "avocado, lime, onion, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 150}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup finely chopped white onion (from 1 small onion)", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from about 1 lime)", "Salt and black pepper", "1 jalape\u00f1o", "2 ripe avocados"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine the onion and lime juice, and season with salt and pepper.
