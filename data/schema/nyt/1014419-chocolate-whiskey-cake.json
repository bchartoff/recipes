It\u2019s just delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/24/dining/whiskeycake/whiskeycake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H25M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cocoa powder, dessert, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1667}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 498, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "69 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "383 milligrams", "sugarContent": "44 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces, more for pan", "85 grams unsweetened cocoa powder (about 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons)", "1 1/2 cups brewed strong coffee", "1/2 cup Irish whiskey", "200 grams granulated sugar (about 1 cup)", "156 grams light brown sugar (about 1 cup)", "240 grams all-purpose flour (about 2 cups)", "8 grams baking soda (about 1  1/2 teaspoons)", "3 grams fine sea salt (about 3/4 teaspoon)", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves", "3 large eggs", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips", "Powdered sugar, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.
