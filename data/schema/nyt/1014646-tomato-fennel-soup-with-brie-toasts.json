A tart, bright tomato soup and a crispy sandwich with an oozing interior: no wonder they are an iconic match. This recipe, spiked with fennel and Pernod, is livelier and more sophisticated than your usual tomato soup. It has a more complex flavor, too, with the fennel bulb adding a pronounced sweetness, along with a very gentle licorice flavor brought out by the Pernod. Serve with slim croutons seasoned with fennel seeds and topped with Brie.
