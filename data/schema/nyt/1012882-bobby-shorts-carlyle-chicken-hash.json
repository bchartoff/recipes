(We\u2019ll cheat and use foie gras mousse and a dash of fake truffle oil.) It must have pleased the man whose name sits above it on the menu at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle: Bobby Short, the elegant saloon singer and pianist who did more than 35 years in the room. You can imagine him eating a plate of it, wiping his lips carefully with a starched and heavy napkin, then heading off into the dark night to work. As the lyric tells us, it\u2019s a make-believe ballroom, let\u2019s dance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/04/dining/Chicken-Hash/Chicken-Hash-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 804, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "63 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "52 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "1150 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["One 3-to-4-pound kosher chicken", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup medium-dry sherry", "1 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth", "1/2 teaspoon truffle oil (optional)", "4 ounces duck-liver mousse (optional)", "Slices of white bread, toasted, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
