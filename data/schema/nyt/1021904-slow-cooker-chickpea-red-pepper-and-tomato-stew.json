{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Chickpea, Red Pepper and Tomato Stew", "description": "This easy vegan stew is inspired by romesco, the Spanish sauce made from roasted red peppers, tomatoes, almonds, garlic, olive oil and vinegar. Here, those flavors come together in a stew that pulls from the pantry, with fast prep and little waste. Instead of stock, this stew relies on the thick liquid from the canned chickpeas, sometimes called aquafaba. And the marinating oil in jarred sun-dried tomatoes is often delicious, augmented with herbs and vinegar. Give yours a little taste to make sure you like it, and then throw that in, too. (If you don\u2019t like it, make up the difference with regular olive oil.) The smoked almonds on top are key, adding necessary crunch and richness, so be generous with them. (If you would like to make this stew on the stovetop, just saut\u00e9 the onion then add the remaining stew ingredients and simmer until the flavors are blended, about 30 minutes. If using a pressure cooker, you can use <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021907\">this pressure-cooker version of the recipe</a>.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/10/dining/sdg-slow-cooker-chickpea-stew/merlin_182444325_ac5b7b75-b5e7-45f8-8f82-b5579d33d39c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "chickpea, roasted red pepper, slow cooker, smoked almonds, tomato, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 554}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, with liquid (or about 4 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas and 1 cup cooking liquid)", "2 (12-ounce) jars roasted red peppers, drained and finely chopped (2 cups)", "1 (14-ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes", "1 (6- to 7-ounce) jar sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped (about 1 cup), oil reserved (about 3 tablespoons)", "1 red onion, finely chopped", "5 garlic cloves, smashed and finely chopped", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for serving", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Red-pepper flakes, for serving", "Chopped smoked almonds, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the chickpeas and their liquid, roasted red peppers, canned tomatoes, chopped sun-dried tomatoes and their oil,\u00a0onion, garlic, vinegar, olive oil, smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and several generous grinds of pepper.
