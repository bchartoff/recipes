But in this recipe, they aren't boiled to death, but braised for just 15 minutes or so in degreased ham stock. Not only is there no stench, but you get the great pork flavor that is such a compliment to greens without the fat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Reed"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "collard greens, ham, shallot, side dish, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 19}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 204, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "346 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound collard greens, cleaned and stemmed", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/4 cup (about 3/4 ounce) country ham, cut in thin strips", "2 tablespoons minced shallots", "1/3 cup aged sherry vinegar", "1/3 cup tupelo honey", "1/2 cup <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9142-smoked-pork-stock\">Smoked Pork Stock</a>", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/4 cup butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut collard greens into chiffonade about 1/2-inch wide and blanch in salted boiling water for 10 seconds.
