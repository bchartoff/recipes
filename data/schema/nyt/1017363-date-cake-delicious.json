{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Date Cake Delicious", "description": "The women of the Thursday Afternoon Cooking Club in Wichita, Kan., have been preparing lunches for each other since 1891. Originally conceived as a way to improve the domestic arts in a fast-growing prairie town, the club has become a repository for more than 124 years of cooking trends and recipes. In 1922, the club published a cookbook. This recipe was adapted from it, updated only to give more precise measurements and cooking times. It has more fruit than a typical date-nut bread and takes nearly an hour to bake. The good news is that you can mix it up quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/22/dining/22SUBWICHITA/22SUBWICHITA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "2 loaves", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes", "keywords": "dates, pecans, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 137}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 326, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "200 milligrams", "sugarContent": "39 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter, for greasing pan", "3 1/4 cup/454 grams flour, sifted, plus additional for dusting pan", "2 cups/340 grams pitted dates, each date cut into three pieces", "1 tablespoon shortening", "1 cup sugar", "1 egg, beaten", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg", "1 cup chopped pecans or other nuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
