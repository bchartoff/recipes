{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Beans With Celery", "description": "This dish is inspired by a Greek recipe from Diane Kochilas\u2019s \u201cThe Glorious Foods of Greece\u201d that calls for giant white beans and about three times as much olive oil. I had regular white beans in my pantry and a bunch of celery left over from a recipe that called for only a couple of stalks (which happens so often). I love the textures here. The celery retains a little crunch, which contrasts nicely with the soft beans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/07/16/health/16recipehealth_600/16recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H20M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "celery, white beans, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 197}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 377, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "13 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "602 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": [" 1/2 pound (about 1 1/8 cups) white beans, rinsed, picked over and soaked for six hours or overnight in 1 quart water", "Salt to taste", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "4 to 5 cups chopped celery, including the leaves", "4 large garlic cloves, minced", "1 8-ounce can tomato sauce, or 2 tablespoons tomato paste diluted in 1 cup water", "1/4 to 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley (to taste)", "Juice of 1 to 2 lemons, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain the beans, and combine in a large saucepan with enough water to cover by 2 inches.
