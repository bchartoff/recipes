{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso Pecan Banana Bread", "description": "This banana bread is a formidable treat: moist on the inside, with a crunchy bite around the edges. Banana bread may have emerged to prominence around the 1930\u2019s \u2014 in the midst of the U.S.\u2019s Great Depression, alongside the urge to economize recipes and the emergence of widespread baking powder usage \u2014 but the dish is now a global mainstay. It\u2019s just as satisfying over coffee in the morning, as a quick bite for lunch or shared over a scoop of ice cream after dinner. The crunch of pecans complements the bread\u2019s softness. Miso adds complexity alongside the banana\u2019s sweetness. Be sure to utilize the ripest bananas you can find because it really will make a difference. This banana bread can hold for several days on the counter or in the fridge, if you have any left.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Bryan Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/15/magazine/15EAT-miso-pecan-banana-bread/15mag--eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9- to 10-inch loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, lunch, snack, dessert", "keywords": "banana, banana bread, brown sugar, make-ahead, miso, pecan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 942}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil, plus more for pan", "1 cup/120 grams pecans", "1 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 cup/220 grams packed brown sugar", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "3 tablespoons milk", "2 tablespoons white miso", "1 tablespoon honey", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "4 very ripe bananas, mashed (1 3/4 cups/358 grams)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
