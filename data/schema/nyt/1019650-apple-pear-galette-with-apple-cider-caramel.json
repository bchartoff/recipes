{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple-Pear Galette With Apple Cider Caramel", "description": "A galette is the perfect dessert for anyone who thinks the crust-to-fruit ratio of the average pie is way off. In a galette, the fruit filling is thinner, so you have more flaky pastry to every bite. It also means a galette cooks a bit faster and can be sliced while warm, a boon for the impatient. Don't be alarmed if your galette leaks as they most often do. The final product never seems to suffer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/09/dining/ss-apple-pear-galette/ss-apple-pear-galette-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "apple, apple cider, pear, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 500}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 445, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "316 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface", "1/2 cup/60 grams whole-wheat flour", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "10 tablespoons/140 grams cold unsalted butter (1 1/4 sticks), cut into pieces", "4 tablespoons/60 milliliters ice water", "1 large egg, lightly beaten, for brushing", "Sanding sugar, for sprinkling (optional)", "1 to 2 crisp apples, such as Pink Lady (12 ounces/340 grams), peeled, cored and very thinly sliced", "1 to 2 just ripe Bartlett pears (12 ounces/340 grams), cored and very thinly sliced", "1/3 cup/75 grams packed dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "3/4 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "2 cups/480 milliliters apple cider", "1/3 cup/75 grams packed dark brown sugar", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, combine flours, sugar and salt.
