{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Almond-Apricot Granola Bars", "description": "Many granola bars are assumed to be healthy, but aren\u2019t. These are. A combination of granola, almonds, apricots and crisp brown rice, the recipe is wide open to interpretation as long as you keep the ratio of glue (the almond butter and honey mixture) to granola and mix-ins about the same. Mix everything together, press it into an oiled dish lined with plastic wrap, and throw it all in the fridge for an hour. These bars are more chewy than crunchy, and will fit well into a child\u2019s lunch bag or a grown-up\u2019s breakfast plate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/28/dining/recipes-almondapricotgranolabar/recipes-almondapricotgranolabar-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "about 16 to 20 granola bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "almond butter, granola, appetizer, side dish, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 104}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 146, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "35 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup almond butter or other nut butter", "1/2 cup honey", "1 cup crispy brown rice cereal", "1 cup granola", "1/2 cup almonds, chopped", "1/2 cup dried apricots, chopped", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "Vegetable oil for greasing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put almond butter and honey in a small saucepan over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until they melt together; whisk to combine."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the crispy cereal, granola, almonds, apricots and salt in a bowl and add the mixture of almond butter and honey; stir well to combine."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grease a 7- or 8-inch-square baking dish with a little oil and line it with plastic wrap.
