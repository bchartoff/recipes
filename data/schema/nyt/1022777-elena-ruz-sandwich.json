The sandwich was an original request \u2014 it didn\u2019t yet exist on menus in Cuba \u2014 but it eventually became something of a beloved national dish. Like other popular Cuban dishes, it combines the sweet and the salty. Some Cuban chefs say that it lends itself to adaptation and experimentation with other jams and sandwich meats. It\u2019s best enjoyed with plantain chips and a Cuban soda, such as Materva or Ironbeer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Christina Morales"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/24/dining/19SANDWICHREX-elena-ruz-sandwich/merlin_197626131_6cadb54c-e5ed-4b16-bdf8-dd106156e6e9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 sandwich", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 400}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 Cuban medianoche roll or a brioche hot dog roll (5 to 6 inches long)", "2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened, plus more as needed", "3 1/2 ounces sliced turkey breast", "1 1/2 tablespoons strawberry preserves, plus more as needed (see Tip)", "1/2 teaspoon unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice or split the bread roll in half to fill as a sandwich.
