{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown-Butter Butter Beans With Lemon and Pesto", "description": "These roasted beans are treated in much the same way as toasted gnocchi, and yield similar results: They\u2019re nicely browned on the surface, then coated in an unctuous, lemony, buttery sauce. Make sure to have your pesto and warm brown-butter sauce ready to pour onto the beans right when they come out of the oven, so that the beans remain crispy and the sauce nice and loose. For a vegetarian version, you can swap out the anchovies for some briny capers and leave out the Parmesan. The whole experience is quite rich, so serve these with some lightly cooked leafy greens.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/17/dining/12Ottorex/merlin_183386466_04270c49-ed1b-4dfd-b5e3-6569b6111664-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, beans, main course, side dish", "keywords": "anchovy, butter beans, parmesan, parsley, fall, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 531}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups (drained) home-cooked, canned or jarred butter beans (about 2 1/4 pounds/1 kilogram)", "7 tablespoons/105 milliliters olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/3 cup/30 grams roughly grated Parmesan", "1/3 cup/15 grams packed roughly chopped parsley", "3 scallions, trimmed and sliced", "2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest plus 1/3 cup/80 milliliters juice (from 3 lemons)", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks)", "8 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "8 oil-packed anchovies, drained and roughly chopped (about 2 packed tablespoons/30 grams)", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit/230 degrees Celsius.
