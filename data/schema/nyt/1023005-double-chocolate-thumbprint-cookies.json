While \u201cthumbprints\u201d is an adorable name, it\u2019s a misnomer: You use every part of your hands to form these. The cookies need to be pinched, patted, rolled around and poked before they\u2019re sent into the oven. It\u2019s a great project to do with kids \u2014 small thumbs are perfect for forming little dimples in the dough. What you fill the centers with is up to you. Chocolate with chocolate is great \u2014 naturally pink ruby chocolate is particularly pretty \u2014 and jam is delicious, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/06/magazine/06mag-eat-site/06mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 40 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "chocolate, cinnamon, cookie, sanding sugar, christmas, mother\u2019s day, valentine\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 514}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/102 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "5 tablespoons/71 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "8 ounces/226 grams semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (about 1\u2153 cups)", "2/3 cup/132 grams granulated sugar", "2 cold large eggs", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "Sanding or granulated sugar, for coating (about \u2153 cup)", "4 ounces/113 grams chocolate (white, milk, dark or ruby), chopped (about \u00bd cup)", "1/2 teaspoon canola oil (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cookies: Whisk together the flour, salt and cinnamon in a small bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a heatproof medium bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water; don\u2019t let the water touch the bottom of the bowl.
