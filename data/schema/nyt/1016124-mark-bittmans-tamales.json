With a little planning, you can have this traditional treat at hand. Start the night before, setting the husks to soak overnight. The next day, mix the masa marina with some chicken stock, lard, salt and baking powder. Lay the mixture onto the husks along with shredded meat, wrap and steam them in a rack. It\u2019s a perfect project for the intermediate home cook, hoping to broaden a skill set. If it feels like a lot, invite a friend over, crack open a couple of beers and make it a party.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/16/magazine/16eat3/16eat3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "24 tamales", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, project", "keywords": "appetizer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 120}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 611, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "106 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "196 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["24 dried corn husks", "3 \u00bd cups masa harina", "2 \u00bc cups chicken stock, approximately", "1 cup lard, cut into cubes", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 \u00bd cups Shredded Red-Chile Meat (see <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1016125/shredded-red-chile-meat.html'>recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak husks in warm water for at least 3 hours or overnight.
