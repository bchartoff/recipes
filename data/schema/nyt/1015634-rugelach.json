The crescent shape and layers of filling might look complicated, but the dough is quite simple to put together (hello, food processor!) and easy to work with. Beyond that, it's really just a matter of rolling, spreading and cutting. These are meant to be bite-sized \u2013 about one-inch long \u2013 but if you want them bigger, go right ahead. (Should you choose to go larger, Dorie suggests rolling the dough into rectangles instead of circles and cutting the dough into bigger triangles. In that way, you would ultimately get more layers of filling and dough.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Weinstein"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/30/dining/30COOKING-RUGELACH1/30COOKING-RUGELACH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "36 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "apricot jam, butter, cream cheese, flour, marmalade, raspberry jam, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 317}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 94, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "32 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces cold cream cheese, cut into 4 pieces", "1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "2/3 cup raspberry jam, apricot jam or marmalade", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 cup chopped nuts (I prefer pecans, but you can use walnuts or almonds)", "1/4 cup plump, moist dried currants", "4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped, or 2/3 cup store-bought mini chocolate chips", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon cold water", "2 tablespoons sugar, preferably decorating (coarse) sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the dough: Let the cream cheese and butter rest on the counter for 10 minutes \u2014 you want them to be slightly softened but still cool."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the flour and salt in a food processor, scatter over the chunks of cream cheese and butter and pulse the machine 6 to 10 times.
