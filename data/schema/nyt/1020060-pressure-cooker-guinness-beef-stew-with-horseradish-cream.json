{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Guinness Beef Stew With Horseradish Cream", "description": "The first step of this hearty cold-weather stew is to put together a quick, aromatic roux directly in the pressure cooker. It sounds fussy, but it\u2019s really not, and it ensures that the final stew is thick and rich, not watery. Beef chuck is the ideal choice here because it is a flavorful cut that becomes fall-apart tender when pressure cooked \u2014 and it does so in a fraction of the time that it would take to braise in the oven. Espresso and cocoa powders subtly reinforce the dark, toasty flavors in the Guinness gravy. Pass the horseradish cream at the table so everyone can top their own bowls.
