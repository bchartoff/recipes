Here is one of the best of those recipes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/25/dining/25COOKING_BATALISPICYSHRIMP/25COOKING_BATALISPICYSHRIMP-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick", "keywords": "appetizer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 877}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 380, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "3534 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons red curry paste", "1/4 cup fish sauce", "1/4 cup sambal", "1/4 cup sweet chili sauce", "2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled\tand deveined", "3 tablespoons light sesame oil", "1 cup sliced scallions", "2 tablespoons sweet soy sauce", "1(14-ounce) can light coconut milk", "1 bunch cilantro, chopped."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine curry paste, fish sauce, sambal \nand chili sauce in a medium bowl; \nadd shrimp, tossing to coat.
