{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Mushroom Larb", "description": "Earthy mushrooms replace meat in this take on larb. A dish popular in the northern and northeastern regions of Thailand, larb is often a lively combination of cooked minced meat, fresh herbs and a punchy dressing. In this recipe, mushrooms are roasted until golden brown and crispy around the edges, and, once cooled, tossed with a mix of cilantro, mint, basil and aromatics, including sliced scallions. Lime juice and soy sauce keep the dressing tangy and savory. A subtle, nutty crunch from toasted ground rice is an essential element of the salad, so don\u2019t skip this step. Serve the dish with steamed rice and additional lime wedges for squeezing.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/28/dining/YK-Mushroom-Larb/YK-Mushroom-Larb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "herbs, mushroom, rice, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1066}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds mixed mushrooms, such as button, oyster, and shiitake, trimmed and quartered, or torn into 2-inch pieces if large", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable oil", "Salt", "2 tablespoons uncooked glutinous or sweet rice", "2 limes", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari", "1 garlic clove, minced", "2 bird\u2019s eye chiles, sliced, or \u00bd teaspoon red-chile flakes", "1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion", "1/4 cup sliced scallions", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, torn", "1/2 cup fresh Thai or sweet basil leaves, torn", "Steamed rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Spread the mushrooms in an even layer on a sheet pan and drizzle with the oil.
