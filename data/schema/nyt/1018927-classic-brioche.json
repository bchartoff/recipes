{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Brioche", "description": "A classic brioche should be tender, eggy and contain croissant levels of rich, delicious butter. Sure, it requires a stand mixer (incorporating the butter by hand wouldn't be possible by most bakers' standards) and 24 hours, but the results are bakery-worthy. It can be made in one day, but an overnight stay in the refrigerator will not only give the dough a deeper flavor, but it will also firm up the butter, making the dough easier to shape and handle when it comes time to bake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/28/dining/28COOKING-CLASSICBRIOCHE/28COOKING-CLASSICBRIOCHE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 loaves", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, breads", "keywords": "bread flour, eggs, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 222}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 310, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "204 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "1/2 cup/100 grams sugar", "4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast (from 2 packets)", "3 cups/360 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "3 cups/360 grams bread flour", "9 large eggs", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups/341 grams unsalted butter (3 sticks), cut into 1-inch pieces, plus more for greasing the bowl"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat milk in a small pot over medium-low heat until just warm.
