{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry Cornbread\u00a0", "description": "Cranberries meet cornbread in this one-bowl fall mashup. A crunchy golden edge forms around the cornbread thanks to the hot skillet the batter is poured into. The mixture crisps in the oven-melted butter that coats the pan, resulting in browning and caramelization that delivers maximum flavor. While baking, the fresh cranberries soften, ensuring a burst of juicy tartness with each bite. Use either fine- or medium-grind cornmeal, as coarse varieties make for an overly gritty bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/01/dining/VL-Cranberry-Cornbread/VL-Cranberry-Cornbread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick breads, side dish", "keywords": "cast iron, cornmeal, cranberry, one bowl, skillet, fall, kwanzaa, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 429}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons/113 grams unsalted butter, plus more for serving\u00a0", "1 1/4 cups/180 grams fine- or medium-grind yellow cornmeal", "1 cup/125 grams all-purpose flour\u00a0", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons baking powder\u00a0", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda\u00a0", "3 large eggs\u00a0", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk\u00a0", "1 cup/115 grams fresh or thawed frozen cranberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the middle of the oven and heat oven to 375 degrees.
