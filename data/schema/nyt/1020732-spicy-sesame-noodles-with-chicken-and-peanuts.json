{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Sesame Noodles With Chicken and Peanuts", "description": "In this quick and spicy weeknight noodle dish, sizzling hot oil is poured over red-pepper flakes, orange peel, crunchy peanuts, soy sauce and sesame oil. While you brown the ground chicken, the mixture sits, and the flavors become more pronounced and fiery. Tossed with soft noodles and browned chicken, the bright chile-peanut oil shines. If you crave something green, throw in a quick-cooking green vegetable when you break up the chicken in Step 3. You can also swap the chicken with ground pork or beef, or crumbled tofu.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/18/dining/as-sesame-noodles/merlin_165769617_7f8cc187-825d-4114-ba1a-34c342286a07-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, noodles, poultry", "keywords": "chives, ground chicken, orange, peanut, ramen, soy sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2685}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons red-pepper flakes", "1 1/2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon neutral oil, like grapeseed or vegetable", "6 tablespoons roasted, salted peanuts, coarsely chopped", "Rind of 1/2 orange, peeled into 2- to 3-inch strips", "1 pound ground chicken", "10 to 12 ounces ramen or udon noodles, preferably fresh", "3 tablespoons finely chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium heatproof bowl, stir together the red-pepper flakes, soy sauce and sesame oil.
