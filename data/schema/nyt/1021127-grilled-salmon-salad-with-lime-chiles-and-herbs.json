{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Salmon Salad With Lime, Chiles and Herbs", "description": "Made of soft, supple salmon; crisp lettuces and vegetables; and a very savory dressing run through with chiles and lime, this light salad is tangy and full of flavor. The dressing, based on nuoc cham, a traditional Vietnamese dipping sauce, has just enough fish sauce to give it depth and pungency without overpowering the brightness of the lime. You can substitute other fish, or even chicken, for the salmon. Just adjust the grilling time as needed, and toss with the dressing while still warm. Note that if you don\u2019t have a grill, you can roast the fish in the oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/02/dining/29apperex/merlin_172921854_95aac7f8-5460-4d17-9760-6da36dcc21de-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, salads and dressings, seafood, main course", "keywords": "fish sauce, herbs, lettuce, salmon, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1553}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 limes", "2 small fresh red or green chiles or 1 large one, thinly sliced, seeds removed if you like", "1 shallot (or 2 scallions, or 2 tablespoons red onion), thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons fish sauce", "Kosher salt", "Pinch of granulated sugar", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil or grapeseed oil, plus more for brushing", "1 1/4 pounds salmon fillet, preferably 1 large center-cut piece", "8 cups salad greens, such as Little Gem, bibb or Boston lettuce", "1 cup mixed soft herbs (such as cilantro, mint and basil), leaves and tender stems", "1 cup thinly sliced radishes, cucumbers or both (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Light the grill for indirect heat, or heat the oven to 450 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "As the grill or oven heat up, make the dressing: Halve 1 lime, and squeeze its juice into a small bowl.
