{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetable Paella With Chorizo", "description": "This weeknight paella comes together in just three basic steps: Sweat the aromatics, bake until tender, then return to the stovetop to cook until the rice becomes crunchy. It becomes even more weeknight-friendly if you take advantage of store-bought pre-cut vegetables to cut down on prep time. For a more protein-rich dish, season a dozen medium shrimp with olive oil, salt and pepper and nestle them into the paella during the last 5 minutes of baking. If preparing the dish for vegetarians, skip the chorizo, swap in vegetable broth and add an extra pinch of paprika, if desired. The only non-negotiable step is finishing the paella over direct flame on the stovetop so the rice at the bottom of the pan forms a delectable crust, also known as soccarat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/dining/kc-smoky-paella/merlin_150673158_d668aacc-20a3-455b-8138-cadd0f8aba5c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, sausages", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, cauliflower, chorizo sausage, paprika, rice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 412}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 597, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "78 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1177 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped yellow or white onion (about 1/2 small onion)", "5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 1/2 cups medium-grain paella rice, such as Bomba or Calasparra (about 10 ounces)", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 1/2 cups 1-inch cauliflower florets (about 10 ounces)", "2 1/2 cups halved brussels sprouts, quartered if large (about 10 ounces)", "1 cup fresh or frozen peas (about 5 ounces)", "1/4 pound/4 ounces cured Spanish chorizo sausage, skin removed, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "Chopped scallions and lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
