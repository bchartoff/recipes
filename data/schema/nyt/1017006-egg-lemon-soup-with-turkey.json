{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Egg Lemon Soup With Turkey", "description": "Modeled after a classic Greek egg lemon soup, this is one of many light, comforting soups that make a nice home for leftover turkey. If you haven\u2019t made stock with the turkey carcass, a quick garlic or vegetable stock will do.
