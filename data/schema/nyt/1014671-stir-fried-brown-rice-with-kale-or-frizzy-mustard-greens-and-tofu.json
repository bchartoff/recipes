They look like a cross between fris\u00e9e and curly kale and have a sharp, mustardy kick. Curly kale makes a fine substitute. Also, you can substitute white rice for the brown.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/16/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "brown rice, mustard greens, tofu, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 42}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 341, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "930 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces curly kale or frizzy mustard greens, or a mix ", "2 eggs, beaten", "Salt to taste", "12 ounces tofu, cut in dominoes and dried on paper towels", "2 tablespoons minced ginger", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "Grapeseed, peanut or canola oil", "4 cups cooked brown rice (2 cups uncooked)", "1 to 2 tablespoons soy sauce (to taste)", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using kale, stem, wash and coarsely chop.

Cook 30 seconds to a minute, tilting the pan so that the eggs spread out into a thin pancake. Once the pancake is set and beginning to color, flip it over with a metal spatula and allow to cook for 5 seconds. Remove to a cutting board and roll up the pancake.
