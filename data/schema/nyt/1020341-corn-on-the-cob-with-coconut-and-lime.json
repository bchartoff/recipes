{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn on the Cob With Coconut and Lime", "description": "Anyone avoiding dairy might notice that corn on the cob served at cookouts usually comes slathered with butter. This vegan alternative uses coconut oil to add richness, lime juice for a little acid, and finely chopped, toasted coconut chips for added texture. Mixing half of the chips into the oil helps them stick to the cob, which is smart because you\u2019ll want them in every bite. If you can\u2019t find coconut chips, toasted unsweetened coconut flakes will add a nutty flavor, but you won\u2019t get the delightful crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Fleischaker"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/09/dining/ef-corn-on-the-cob-with-coconut-and-lime/merlin_157388769_254346f7-48fc-4076-85ce-bb3f710bda3f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, coconut flakes, coconut oil, corn, lime, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ears fresh corn, shucked", "1 lime", "4 tablespoons coconut oil", "1/2 cup toasted unsweetened large coconut chips, finely chopped (or 3 tablespoons toasted unsweetened coconut flakes)", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat your grill to medium-high.
