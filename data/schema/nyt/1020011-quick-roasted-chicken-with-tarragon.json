It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nFrench elegance on the fly. Heat the oven to 425, or higher if your oven runs cool. Mix a few tablespoons of mayonnaise with a little Dijon mustard and a lot of chopped tarragon in a large bowl until everything\u2019s incorporated to your liking. Salt and pepper some chicken thighs \u2014 I\u2019d do bone-in, but boneless would also work \u2014 then add the thighs to the mustard mixture, tossing to coat the meat. Arrange the chicken on a greased sheet pan and cover each piece with a handful of bread crumbs, really pressing the crumbs in so they adhere.\n\nSlide that pan into the oven for a half-hour or so while you make some rice or boil off a few potatoes. You can make a salad, or steam some greens. Then check to see if the chicken has been cooked all the way through. Probably not. Another five or 10 minutes ought to do it. You\u2019re looking for a nice crisp crust, golden brown, above the luscious meat.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17norecipe-dijonchicken/merlin_147764013_0adff151-60d4-4836-a9bc-59405c7c78bb-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, tarragon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 411}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
