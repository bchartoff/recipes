{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Milanese With Tomato, Mozzarella and Basil Salad", "description": "A classic veal Milanese consists of pounded veal cutlets or chops that have been breaded in crumbs and sometimes Parmesan, then fried until the coating is burnished and brittle. Accompanied by a crisp, bright salad, it\u2019s a meal both cooling and rich. In this version, chicken breasts replace the veal, and a salad of tomatoes and mozzarella tossed with garlicky basil oil acts as the foil to the meat. If you want to work ahead, you can coat the cutlets in crumbs up to 4 hours ahead. Store them on a wire rack in the fridge. But try to serve them freshly fried when their coating is at its crunchiest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/dining/13apperex/13apperex-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "basil, chicken cutlet, mozzarella, panko, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 786}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 775, "unsaturatedFatContent": "39 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "59 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "728 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds chicken cutlets, pounded 1/4-inch thick", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, as needed", "2/3 cup plus 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2/3 cup basil leaves", "1 fat garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1 pound cherry or grape tomatoes, halved", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "2 large eggs, beaten", "1 1/4 cups panko bread crumbs", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly season chicken cutlets all over with salt and pepper; let rest while you make the basil oil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a blender or food processor,\u00a0combine 2/3 cup oil, basil, garlic and salt to taste; pur\u00e9e until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, toss tomatoes and mozzarella with about half of the basil oil and salt to taste.
