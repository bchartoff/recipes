{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pecan Pie", "description": "Pecan pie is to the Southern Thanksgiving table what pumpkin, mince and apple pies are to the Northern version of the meal. Pecan trees can be found in back and front yards in Georgia, Texas and states in between, and pecan pie is a year-round dessert. The classic rendition is cloyingly sweet, because of the cup or cup and a half of corn syrup that most recipes call for. But you can dispense with the corn syrup and use a combination of mild honey (like clover or acacia) and Lyle\u2019s Golden Syrup, which has a wonderful flavor that is almost like light molasses. It\u2019s not the standard corn syrup, but you\u2019ll end up with a pie that\u2019s lighter but still sweet, true to Southern style.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/dining/19GEORGIA/19GEORGIA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "9-inch pie, 8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, pecans", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 281}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 597, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "306 milligrams", "sugarContent": "21 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces/222 grams French-style butter (82 percent fat), at room temperature", "3/4 teaspoon/6 grams salt", "2 tablespoons/30 grams sugar", "3 cups/375 grams flour, sifted", "4 tablespoons/2 ounces/60 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters mild honey, such as clover or acacia", "1/4 cup/59 milliliters Lyle\u2019s Golden Syrup", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters dark rum", "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "Pinch of salt", "4 extra-large eggs", "2 cups/235 grams shelled pecans", "Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix butter, salt and sugar in a standing mixer on low speed for 1 minute.
