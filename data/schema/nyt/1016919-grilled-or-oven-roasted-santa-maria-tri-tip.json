{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled or Oven-Roasted Santa Maria Tri-Tip", "description": "You might need to ask your butcher (assuming you have one) or even a store meat manager to order in a tri-tip roast. Two pounds is a good size, but if you come across a larger one, by all means grab it as the extra meat makes amazing sandwiches. The trick is to carve the tri-tip against the grain, which can change directions in this cut. So before you rub it and roast it, take a look at the raw meat and see which direction the long strands of muscle fiber are running on each part of the roast. After the roast has been cooked, and it has rested for 15 minutes or so, slice the roast in two at the place where the fibers change direction. Carve each piece separately.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/29/dining/29JPTRITIP1/29JPTRITIP1-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "barbecue", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, barbecues, steaks and chops", "keywords": "beef, tri-tip steak, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 925}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 158, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "47 milligrams", "sugarContent": null, "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole tri-tip, about 2 pounds", "3 tablespoons beef rub of your choice (see <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016918-all-purpose-california-beef-rub\">recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim silver skin.
