{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herb-and-Olive Frittata", "description": "In this recipe, herbs are the focus, but to use herbs on a grand scale, it helps to know which ones work in that role and which ones don\u2019t. Parsley, obviously, works in abundance: it\u2019s clean-tasting, pleasantly grassy and almost never overwhelming. You can add literally a bunch (bunches!) of it to salad, soup, eggs, pasta, grains or beans. The same is largely true of basil, and you can use other mild herbs \u2014 chervil, chives, cilantro, dill, shiso \u2014 by at least the handful. (Mint is also useful but will easily take over a dish if you add too much of it.) I put most other herbs \u2014 epazote, lavender, marjoram and oregano, rosemary, sage, tarragon and thyme \u2014 in the category of strong herbs, which must be used more sparingly than mild herbs. You usually don\u2019t want to use more than a tablespoon or so of strong herbs in a dish. This frittata uses generous amounts of both parsley and basil and lesser amounts of dill, mint, rosemary or thyme.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/22/dining/Herb-and-Olive-Frittata/Herb-and-Olive-Frittata-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, quick", "keywords": "black olives, eggs, fresh herbs, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 57}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 212, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "343 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large onion, chopped", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1/2 cup chopped black olives, preferably oil-cured", "1 cup chopped fresh parsley", "1 cup chopped fresh basil", "1/2 cup chopped fresh dill", "1/2 cup chopped fresh mint", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary or thyme", "8 eggs, lightly beaten", "1/2 cup milk", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "Salt", "black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
