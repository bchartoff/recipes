{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Uncooked Tomato and Mint Sauce with Poached Eggs", "description": "This dish turns summer tomatoes into a salsa cruda that can also work well with most any kind of fish. My friend and colleague Clifford A. Wright serves this delicious salsa cruda with grilled salmon. It\u2019s also wonderful with most other fish, grilled, oven-roasted or pan-cooked, and it makes a terrific sauce for foods like cooked grains, the vegetarian burgers I published a few weeks ago or simply cooked green vegetables. One of my favorite uses is in a Mediterranean huevos rancheros: poach an egg, set it on a lightly charred corn tortilla, sprinkle the egg with a little salt and pepper if desired and spoon on the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/22/science/21recipehealth/21recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high protein, kosher, low-carb, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 38}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 173, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "348 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 ripe plum tomatoes (about 1 pound)", "2 plump garlic cloves, peeled, halved, green shoots removed", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, lightly packed.", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "4 to 6 eggs", "1 tablespoon vinegar (any type)", "4 to 6 corn tortillas", "Feta cheese for crumbling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut tomatoes in half lengthwise.
