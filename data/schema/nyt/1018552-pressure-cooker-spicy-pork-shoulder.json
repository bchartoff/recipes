{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Spicy Pork Shoulder", "description": "You can make this spicy pork in a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker if you\u2019re in a hurry, or in a slow cooker if you're not. In either case, you\u2019ll get tender bits of meat covered in a chile-flavored barbecue sauce that\u2019s just slightly sweet. (You can also make it in a stovetop pressure cooker, by trimming a few minutes off the cooking time. Stovetop pressure cookers tend to cook at a slightly higher pressure, so food cooks more quickly.) Gochujang, a pungent Korean chile paste, and gochugaru, Korean chile flakes, is available at Asian markets and specialty shops, or see the ingredient list for substitutions.\nServe the pork over rice or in slider rolls, topped with crunchy pickled sesame cucumbers and a little kimchi, if you want to spice things up. And, while you can make this from start to finish in an afternoon, you can also make this in stages a few days ahead, if that\u2019s easier.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/01/dining/01APPE1-1485571587076/01APPE1-1485571587076-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts, soups and stews", "keywords": "cucumbers, gochujang, mirin, pork shoulder, red pepper flakes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1483}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced", "2 tablespoons brown sugar or honey", "1 tablespoon Korean chile flakes (gochugaru) or other chile flakes (Maras, Aleppo or crushed red pepper)", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "5 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into two or three pieces", "1 tablespoon peanut oil", "4 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane", "2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root", "1/3 cup gochujang (Korean chile paste) or other chile paste or sauce such as Sriracha", "1/4 cup soy sauce", "2 tablespoons ketchup", "2 tablespoons mirin", "2 tablespoons honey", "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon Asian fish sauce", "1 teaspoon sesame oil", "6 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced (or about 4 cups sliced cucumbers)", "1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "2 teaspoons brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion", "2 teaspoons sesame seeds", "Cooked rice or toasted slider rolls", "Kimchi (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To prepare pork, combine garlic, brown sugar, chile flakes, salt and pepper.
