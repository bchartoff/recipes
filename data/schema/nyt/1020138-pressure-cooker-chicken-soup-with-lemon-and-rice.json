{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Chicken Soup With Lemon and Rice", "description": "Lightly thickened with egg yolks and sour cream, this comforting soup is both deeply satisfying and springy-bright. Choose the amount of lemon juice that\u2019s right for you: Using a half cup makes an assertively tart soup, while the smaller amount gives a gentler result. This soup is a really excellent way to use up leftover rice. Any kind of cooked rice will work, though white jasmine and basmati are particularly nice. Finish the soup with a big hit of dill for freshness, but other soft, fresh herbs of your choice would also be welcome.\n<em>Find the slow-cooker version of the recipe <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019699-slow-cooker-creamy-chicken-soup-with-lemon-rice-and-dill?action=click&module=RecipeBox&pgType=recipebox-page&region=all&rank=16\">here</a>. </em>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-chicken-and-rice-soup/merlin_146005377_b8ba76cc-d93f-4603-943d-69cc3a7516e9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken broth, chicken thighs, dill, lemon, rice, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 123}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 514, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1293 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large yellow or red onion, chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "6 large garlic cloves, minced", "2 to 2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "6 cups chicken broth or stock", "1 bay leaf", "2 cups cooked white rice", "5 large egg yolks", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1/3 to 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 2 large lemons), plus more as needed", "1 bunch dill, chopped (about 1 loosely packed cup)", "3 scallions, thinly sliced (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a 6- to 8-quart pressure cooker on the saut\u00e9 setting.
