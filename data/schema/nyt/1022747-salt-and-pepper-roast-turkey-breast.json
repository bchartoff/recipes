{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salt-and-Pepper Roast Turkey Breast", "description": "A bone-in turkey breast is significantly easier to cook than a whole bird, it takes a fraction of the time, and it still feeds a group comfortably. To ensure succulence, you could apply <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012869-dry-brined-turkey\">a dry brine</a> the night before, but when you\u2019re cooking just a breast, the greatest insurance against dryness is pulling it out of the oven the moment it\u2019s done, and no later. (For that, rely on an electric instant-read meat thermometer; it\u2019s the only way to get a truly accurate read on the internal temperature of your meat.) I like to roast turkey the way I roast chicken: unbrined but slathered in butter, showered with salt and pepper and popped into a moderately hot oven to get crispy skin. Once the slices are fanned out on a platter tumbled with lemon wedges, it looks like a veritable feast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15BEGINNERREX1-TURKEY/merlin_197340726_ff048808-36a4-47db-a8f8-29df1e8ae360-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT12H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry, main course", "keywords": "butter, lemon, turkey breast, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 567}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup unsalted butter, very soft", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 whole (6- to 8-pound) bone-in turkey breast (see Tip)", "4 lemons, quartered, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Keep the butter nearby.

(To read the temperature, insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of one of the breasts, making sure to avoid the bone, which will give you an inaccurate reading.)\u00a0Very carefully rotate the pan halfway through roasting and add another cup of water if the pan looks dry. When done roasting (1 1/2 to 2 hours), the skin should be golden brown and crispy."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Let the turkey breast rest in its pan, uncovered, until cool enough to handle, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Transfer to a cutting board. Cut along one side of the breastbone with a sharp knife, then the other, cutting each breast off the bone, and keeping the skin intact. Thickly slice each breast crosswise and serve on a large platter scattered with the lemon quarters. Taste the pan juices and, if they\u2019re a little salty, stir in a little hot water.
