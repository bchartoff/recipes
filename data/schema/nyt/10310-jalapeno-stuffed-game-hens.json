Season the hens with salt and pepper. Place 4 jalapeno halves in the cavity of each hen. Wrap 3 slices of bacon over the breast on each hen, securing the bacon with toothpicks that have been soaked in water. Place the hens on the grill and cook until well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Cover the grill and cook until hens are cooked through, about 40 minutes, turning once.
