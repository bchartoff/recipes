{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach and Millet Timbale With Tomato Sauce", "description": "A timbale is a molded custard, somewhat similar to a quiche without a crust. It differs from a gratin because it is cooked at a lower heat in a water bath so the sides don\u2019t brown and stick to the baking dish, allowing you to unmold it. This one is delicious served with homemade marinara sauce (see <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1016147/simple-marinara-sauce.html\">recipe</a>).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/20/dining/timbale/timbale-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 main dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "baby spinach, eggs, millet, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 8}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 212, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "472 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 eggs", "2 cups, tightly packed, blanched spinach* (about 10 ounces blanched; 1 1/2 pounds baby spinach or 3 pounds bunch, on the stem), finely chopped", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves", "2 garlic cloves, finely minced (optional)", "1 cup cooked millet", "3 ounces Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated (3/4 cup)", "2/3 cup 2 percent milk", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 1/2 cups marinara sauce "], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
