{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Chopped Pesto and Peas", "description": "This pesto doesn\u2019t call for a food processor, blender, or mortar and pestle \u2014 and it\u2019s better for it. Instead, all of the elements are chopped and mashed together by hand. (Pesto means \u201cto pound, crush or smash\u201d in Italian.) In Tuscany, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/nyregion/food-pesto-finds-its-way-into-a-variety-of-dishes.html\">this would</a> be done with a half moon-shaped mezzaluna, but a chef\u2019s knife does the job, too. The result is a more textured mix with bright pops of flavor, like a sauce, herb salad and nut garnish in one. Basil and pine nuts are classic choices, but this version, \u201cI Dream of Dinner (So You Don\u2019t Have To),\u201d by Ali Slagle (Clarkson Potter, 2022), was guided by the pesto ratio in \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat\u201d by Samin Nosrat. It works with whatever soft herbs and nuts that you like and have on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/dining/18PASTAREX2-pea-pesto/merlin_205476441_ebff0f96-b47d-489c-a34c-561d5dd380aa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "basil, pasta, walnut, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 313}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup raw walnuts, pine nuts, pistachios, almonds or a combination", "2 ounces Parmesan, plus more for serving", "1 large garlic clove", "2 packed cups soft herbs, such as basil, parsley, mint or arugula", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 pound curly pasta, such as casarecce or fusilli\u00a0", "2 cups (10 ounces) frozen peas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
