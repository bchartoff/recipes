{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Extra-Crispy Parmesan-Crusted Roasted Potatoes", "description": "These potatoes combine the fluffy interior and crispy exterior of the best roasted potatoes with the crunchy cheese crust of Detroit-style pizza. The initial boil with aromatics adds herbal flavor to the potatoes, without the potential of burned herbs in the final roast, while baking soda in the water helps soften the surface of the potato, releasing starch. This starch combines with Parmesan and melted butter to form a flavorful slurry that crisps up and coats each potato chunk in a cheesy shell.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
