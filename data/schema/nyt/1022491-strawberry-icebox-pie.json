{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Icebox Pie", "description": "If you adore creamy strawberry desserts, this deluxe icebox pie topped with glossy, springy homemade strawberry gelatin is a treat you won\u2019t want to miss. The recipe, from Morgenstern\u2019s Finest Ice Cream in New York, updates a classic strawberry icebox pie with two major tweaks. Instead of using frozen whipped topping and a box of strawberry gelatin, it calls for freshly whipped heavy cream and the juice drained from an entire pound of macerated berries. The recipe does take some time to put together, but results in the richest, silkiest and most deeply strawberry flavored pie imaginable. You\u2019ll need to start this at least one day before you want to serve it, but it keeps well for up to three days in the fridge. The wafer cookies get softer and more cakelike as they sit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/01/dining/27Apperex/merlin_193478196_e3a909a7-135d-4237-b37d-94a1f42193c5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1D", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, project, dessert", "keywords": "powdered gelatin, strawberries, vanilla wafers", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 256}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound thinly sliced strawberries (about 3 cups)", "3 tablespoons/38 grams granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons/6 grams powdered gelatin", "1/2 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "3 tablespoons/42 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing", "3 1/2 cups/200 grams vanilla wafers (such as Nilla wafers) or about 1 3/4 cups crumbs", "2 tablespoons/25 grams granulated sugar", "10 ounces strawberries (about 2 cups)", "1 cup/ 240 milliliters cold heavy cream", "2 tablespoons/15 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "13 vanilla wafers/45 grams, cut into halves", "Whipped cream, sweetened or unsweetened"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the strawberry gelatin: combine sliced strawberries and sugar in a medium heat proof (preferably metal) bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 18 to 24 hours."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the crust: Heat oven to 325 degrees and lightly grease a 9- or 10-inch pie dish (don\u2019t use anything smaller).
