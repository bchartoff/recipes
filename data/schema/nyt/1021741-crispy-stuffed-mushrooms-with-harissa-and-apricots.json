{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Stuffed Mushrooms With Harissa and Apricots", "description": "In this twist on stuffed mushrooms, the caps are filled with seasoned bread crumbs laced with sweet dried apricots and spiked with harissa and cumin. Showered with grated Parmesan, the caps get supremely crisp on top as they bake, staying rich and tender in the middle. These are best devoured still warm from the oven, but are nearly as good at room temperature. Or bake them up to 6 hours ahead and reheat them briefly in a 350-degree oven before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/23/dining/18apperex4-mushrooms/18apperex4-mushrooms-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "finger foods", "keywords": "cremini, dried apricots, harissa, panko, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 345}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces cremini or button mushrooms", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "1/2 small onion, finely chopped", "1 small red chile or jalape\u00f1o, seeded if desired and finely diced", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 tablespoon harissa paste", "1 teaspoon tomato paste", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "1/3 cup, plus 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems", "1 1/2 tablespoons chopped dried apricots", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the mushroom stems from the caps and chop the stems."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a medium skillet over medium heat, then add 2 tablespoons olive oil and let it warm up until it thins out, about 20 seconds.
