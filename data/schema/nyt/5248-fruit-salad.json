{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fruit Salad", "description": "Orange-fleshed fruits, blueberries and pomegranate are all known to be supercharged with antioxidants, which scientists and dietitians say are good for us. Well, they might or might not be right, but any way you mix it, a salad of fresh mango, blueberries and pomegranate seeds, squirted with a little fresh lime juice, makes you feel good. I know all the vitamins are most present when the salad is freshly made, but I like to have a container of this ready in the fridge. It tastes so juicily wonderful and looks so beautiful that you would never know there was any reason to eat it save for the pleasure alone.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/27/dining/fruitsalad-still/fruitsalad-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 to 2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 112}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 180, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "4 milligrams", "sugarContent": "36 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ripe mango", "1 cup blueberries", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds", "2 teaspoons lime juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut through mango skin as if to cut mango in two, but do not cut through fruit.
