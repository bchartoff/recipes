{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pickle-Brined Fried Chicken Sandwich", "description": "Pointedly low-fuss and remarkably moist, this recipe gets its verve from pickles used two ways: Dill pickle brine seasons and moistens the chicken from the inside-out, while chopped pickles add zip to the coleslaw. Many fried chicken sandwich recipes use breasts, but thighs have more fat, which means they\u2019re more flavorful and harder to overcook. The chicken also fries at a lower temperature, so it finishes cooking and its crust crisps at precisely the same time.\u00a0The buttermilk is key to the crispness here, so avoid any substitutions. Paired with cornstarch, it forms a thick crust that shatters with each bite.\u00a0This sandwich is best enjoyed immediately, with your favorite hot sauce and a pile of napkins.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/05/dining/aw-pickle-brined-fried-chicken-sandwich/aw-pickle-brined-fried-chicken-sandwich-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry, sandwiches", "keywords": "buttermilk, capers, chicken, mayonnaise, pickles, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 238}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 4 ounces each)", "24 dill pickle coins (about 3/4 packed cup), plus 1/2 cup pickle brine", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "4 teaspoons drained capers, chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup buttermilk", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup cornstarch", "1 tablespoon onion powder", "Canola oil or other neutral oil, for frying (4 to 6 cups)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 soft buns, like brioche, split", "1 1/3 cups thinly sliced green cabbage (about 4 ounces)", "Thinly sliced red onion, for serving (optional)", "Hot sauce, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the chicken thighs and 1/2 cup pickle brine to a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours, turning the bag occasionally to marinate evenly."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "While the chicken marinates, prepare the pickle mayonnaise: Finely chop 8 dill pickle coins.
