{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Swordfish With Caramelized Eggplant and Capers", "description": "Soft, caramelized eggplant and chunks of meaty swordfish vie for your attention in this complexly flavored main course. The eggplant, first broiled, then simmered with wine, diced fresh tomatoes, olives and capers, collapses into a silky caponata-like sauce. The swordfish, enriched with butter and spiked with garlic and herbs, becomes meltingly tender. If you\u2019d rather not use swordfish, you can substitute fresh tuna or even chunks of boneless, skinless chicken breast. Serve it with rice, polenta or crusty bread to sop up every last, tender morsel.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/07/dining/02apperex/merlin_177584094_3088695d-3e31-497c-97ad-eea64084cde7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood, main course", "keywords": "eggplant, olives, swordfish, tomato, white wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 906}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced", "1 cup chopped fresh tomatoes (any kind will work)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 garlic cloves, grated or minced", "1/3 cup dry white wine or ros\u00e9 (or use chicken or vegetable broth)", "2 tablespoons chopped, pitted Castelvetrano or other green olives", "1 tablespoon drained capers", "1 1/2 pounds swordfish, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks (see Note)", "1/4 cup chopped parsley", "Torn basil leaves, for garnish", "Lemon or lime juice, to taste (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a broiler rack 4 inches from the heat source, and heat the broiler.
