He aimed to create a drink that was festive, like a hot spiced cider, while avoiding  the rich excesses of some traditional holiday tipples. The cocktail is basically a whiskey sour armed with two secret weapons: the distinctly sweet-tart flavor of Honeycrisp apple juice and Amaro Abano, which the bartender called a \u201cspice bomb, adding cinnamon and clove notes while adding a pleasant bitterness.\u201d It is suited for the cocktail hour, or just before dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/06/dining/video-holiday-drinks-mott-1/video-holiday-drinks-mott-1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, cocktails", "keywords": "apple, whiskey, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 901, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "203 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "47 milligrams", "sugarContent": "188 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup Demerara sugar", "2 Honeycrisp apples", "1 ounce rye whiskey, preferably Old Overholt", "1 ounce Luxardo Amaro Abano", "1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make Demerara syrup: In a small saucepan, mix the sugar with 1 cup water.
