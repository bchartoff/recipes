Heat the oil in a saucepan until hot, add the butter and, as soon as it melts, add the wet cabbage. Cover and cook over medium-to-high heat, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted and tender but still slightly firm. The cabbage will sizzle initially but then will stew as the water emerges from it. Mix in the pepper and salt and serve immediately."}]}
