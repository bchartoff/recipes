{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Layer Cake", "description": "This impressive and wonderfully moist layer cake is less sweet than the usual coconut affair, thanks to a tangy cream cheese frosting on top and dose of orange juice in the batter. This is a great dessert to make in advance. You can bake the cake layers up to 3 days ahead and store them, well-wrapped in plastic, in the refrigerator. The frosted cake will keep for 2 days in the fridge as well, either under a cake dome or overturned bowl, or loosely tented with foil. Just make sure to bring the cake to room temperature before serving.\n\nHere are <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692/996375-lovely-layer-cakes\">more layer cake recipes</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/04/dining/04APPE1/04APPE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, cream of coconut, shredded unsweetened coconut, unsweetened coconut milk, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 847}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 sticks/226 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus more for pans", "2 cups/265 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for pans", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams fine sea salt", "2 teaspoons/10 grams baking powder", "3/4 cup/140 grams granulated sugar", "3 eggs, separated, plus 3 whites", "1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters sweetened cream of coconut, such as Coco Lopez", "1 1/4 cups/295 milliliters unsweetened coconut milk", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters coconut or dark rum", "7 tablespoons/104 milliliters freshly squeezed orange juice", "3 cups/370 grams unsweetened shredded coconut", "2 sticks/226 grams unsalted butter, softened", "2 cups/454 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons/10 milliliters vanilla extract", "7 1/4 cups/2 pounds/907 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 3/4 cups/340 grams unsweetened shredded or flaked coconut, toasted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Make the cake:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grease 3 8-inch cake pans and dust with flour.
