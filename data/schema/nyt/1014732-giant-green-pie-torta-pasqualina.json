The finished product, though, is impressive to behold, and you\u2019re sure to draw compliments from your dining companions. Traditional cooks use a strudel-like pastry, rolled out very thin into a large circle, for the pie. At least four layers are necessary, brushed with oil to achieve a flaky crust. (You can get good results with phyllo dough or ordinary pie dough.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/11/dining/11grnpie/11grnpie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pies and tarts", "keywords": "eggs, greens, ricotta, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 215}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 330, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "555 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["375 grams all-purpose flour, about 3 cups, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon salt", "4 tablespoons olive oil", "2 1/2 pounds washed greens (a mix of chard, spinach or other greens) ", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing pastry layers", "3 cups diced onion", "Salt and pepper ", "Grated nutmeg, to taste", "1 cup ricotta", "3 ounces grated Parmesan", "9 large eggs", "2 teaspoons sugar, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Put flour in a large mixing bowl.
