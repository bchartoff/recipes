{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Garlicky Anchovies and Broccoli Rabe", "description": "Anchovies star in this robust, wintery pasta dish, lending a savory backbone to a pan full of wilted broccoli rabe and fresh tomatoes. Although the anchovies and garlic are saut\u00e9ed in olive oil, butter is added at the end, giving the sauce some richness and body, and mellowing the bitterness of the broccoli rabe. Note that while the ricotta adds creaminess to the pasta, it is strictly optional. Leave it out for a leaner dish with a more concentrated flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/05/dining/31apperex/merlin_167663655_5e396047-c383-4b1e-b794-90ff595b7717-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "anchovy, broccoli rabe, parsley, pasta, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 257}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "12 ounces short pasta, such as shells, wagon wheels or rigatoni", "2 packed cups parsley, leaves and tender stems", "10 anchovy fillets, preferably packed in olive oil (one 2-ounce tin)", "1 small bunch scallions, white and green parts, chopped", "2 tablespoons capers, drained (optional)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced to a paste", "1 (1-pound) bunch broccoli rabe, trimmed and chopped into 1-inch pieces", "1/2 cup chopped fresh tomato (plum, cherry or grape work well)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "Freshly ground black pepper", "Ricotta, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil.
