{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Goose Pho", "description": "Wade Truong is the head chef at Kybecca in Fredericksburg, Va. He is also a skilled hunter who does his best to eat only wild game at home. As a result, his freezer always has a stash of goose and duck carcasses, which he turns into pho. Mr. Truong's recipe is based on techniques he learned at his parents\u2019 restaurant, Saigon Caf\u00e9 in Harrisonburg, Va., and can be adapted to work with a mix of meats. Although geese give the pho a cleaner, beefier flavor, he sometimes uses duck, which imparts an earthier taste. Cooks who don\u2019t have access to goose or duck carcasses can use a combination of chicken carcasses and beef bones. Mr. Truong adds goose or duck feet, which are rich in collagen, to give the soup the distinct, silky mouth feel of a good consomm\u00e9. The feet are optional, but he suggests at least adding chicken feet; your butcher or poultry purveyors at the farmers' market can usually sell you some.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/dining/06gamerex01/merlin_149765553_fcb45884-4ec7-4fef-8ab1-75afe06aef3f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H", "recipeYield": "6 servings, plus extra broth to freeze", "recipeCuisine": "american, vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "cinnamon stick, duck, ginger, goose, rice noodles, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["6 to 8 goose, duck or chicken feet (about 1/2 pound total)", "4 raw goose carcasses or 8 raw duck carcasses (about 6 pounds total), or 2 raw chicken carcasses plus 4 pounds beef soup bones", "1 large yellow onion, halved (skin on)", "1 (2-inch) piece unpeeled ginger, halved lengthwise", "3 egg whites (optional)", "1/2 cup coriander seeds", "3 cinnamon sticks, preferably Saigon cinnamon", "8 star anise pods", "24 green cardamom pods", "6 black cardamom pods", "12 whole cloves", "2 tablespoons fennel seeds", "1/4 to 1/2 cup granulated sugar", "2 to 4 tablespoons fish sauce", "1 to 3 tablespoons monosodium glutamate (MSG), optional", "Kosher salt, to taste", "1 (16-ounce) package dried flat rice noodles", "Very thinly sliced braised or confit goose, duck or venison, or rare duck breast (optional)", "Various pho toppings and garnishes, such as Thai basil, cilantro, thinly sliced onion, lime wedges, chopped scallions, mung bean sprouts, mint, sliced jalape\u00f1o, hoisin sauce or Sriracha"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
