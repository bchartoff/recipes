{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Vegan Polenta With Mushrooms and Kale", "description": "While it may be difficult to imagine many classic Italian dishes without a generous sprinkle of Parmesan, polenta\u2019s creamy nature means it\u2019s easy to make without butter or cheese. Nutritional yeast, when used in moderation, mimics the nutty flavor of Parmesan, but use too much, and it can overpower. Just a tablespoon or two does the trick here, along with a few tablespoons of vegan butter. (You can use olive oil, but vegan butter works best to achieve the richness of traditional polenta.) The red wine braised mushrooms and kale take the place of meat, but the polenta would be equally delicious served with simply saut\u00e9ed greens or roasted root vegetables. Leftover polenta can be reheated over medium-low with a splash of broth or water.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/25/dining/lh-vegan-polenta-with-mushrooms/merlin_181989942_f6a81693-9cc2-4afa-a6bb-d3f3c2d96168-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "kale, mushroom, polenta, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1058}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 cups polenta, medium- or coarse-grind cornmeal, or corn grits", "3 tablespoons vegan butter", "1 to 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast, to taste", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 small yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 pound cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "2/3 cup full-bodied red wine (see Tip)", "1 cup\u00a0low-sodium vegetable broth", "1 large or 2 small bunches curly kale, Tuscan kale or Swiss chard (about 10 ounces), stemmed, then leaves torn into bite-size pieces", "1 teaspoon red wine vinegar", "Chopped fresh parsley, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the polenta: Bring 6 cups vegetable broth and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in a large saucepan.
