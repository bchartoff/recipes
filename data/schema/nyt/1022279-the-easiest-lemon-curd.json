{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Easiest Lemon Curd", "description": "Using a microwave to cook lemon curd streamlines the entire process, and eliminates the need to stand over the stove whisking constantly. The result is silky-smooth and as tart as you like. Use the smaller amount of sugar for a puckery curd, and more for something with greater balance. Once you get the technique down (and it may take some finessing since everyone\u2019s microwave is a bit different), you can vary the citrus, substituting lime or grapefruit for lemon, and seasoning it with makrut lime leaves or Campari (see Tips). Curd will keep in the fridge for at least five days; serve it with cookies or fruit, fold it into whipped cream to make lemon mousse or spoon it into a tart shell for a glossy lemon tart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/09/dining/04Apperex-curd/merlin_188667861_7ac23007-3e60-489f-a646-d556056b11d0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "egg, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 753}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick)", "2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest", "1 cup/240 milliliters freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 4 to 6 lemons)", "3/4 cup to 1 cup/150 grams to 200 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs", "1 egg yolk", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the butter in a large (at least 6 cup) microwave-safe glass bowl or measuring cup.
