{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan de Jam\u00f3n (Venezuelan Ham Bread)", "description": "This recipe for the traditional Venezuelan Christmas bread comes from Martha Beltr\u00e1n in Austin, Tex., who brought the recipe with her when she moved to the United States and now considers it essential to her family's Thanksgiving feast. Ms. Beltr\u00e1n always starts the bread the day before she serves it, laminating it with butter three times before rolling it up with ham, bacon, olives and pimentos. The process can be long, but the dough can be left in the fridge for a flexible and forgiving amount of time, even overnight. When the finished loaves are sliced, each piece reveals a festive butter-slicked swirl.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/12/dining/COOKING-BREAD1/COOKING-VENEZUELAN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15H", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 servings (4 loaves)", "recipeCuisine": "south american", "recipeCategory": "breads, project", "keywords": "bacon, bread, ham, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 23}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 807, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "1206 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/250 milliliters whole milk", "1/4 cup/50 grams plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 ounce/14 grams/4 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast", "1 pound/454 grams salted butter (4 sticks), room temperature", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "7 eggs", "4 1/2 cups/509 grams self-rising flour", "3 1/3 cups/483 grams all-purpose flour, more for dusting surface", "1/2 pound/226 grams ham, thinly sliced and cut into long strips 1/2 inch wide", "18 ounces/509 grams smoked uncured bacon, cut into long 1/2-inch-wide strips (do not use thick cut)", "2 cups/288 grams raisins", "1/2 cup/85 grams pimento-stuffed green olives, thinly sliced", "1/4 cup/59 milliliters whole milk", "1 tablespoon sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the bread: In a small pot over medium-low heat, scald milk.
