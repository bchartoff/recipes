But the ingredient that really makes this recipe shine is the cardamom, a spice that has been treasured in Europe for centuries and has been subtly employed since then in pastries throughout the northern part of the continent. These pancakes are incredibly tender, with a little chew from the grain and the dried fruit, but beyond that they\u2019re exotic. Here are flavors and textures that ordinary pancakes could never approach.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/27/dining/recipes-cardamomoatmealpancakes/recipes-cardamomoatmealpancakes-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "dried apricots, rolled oats, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 228}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 191, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "315 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup whole-wheat flour", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup rolled oats", "1/3 cup chopped almonds", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "3/4 teaspoon salt", "1 egg", "1/2 cup milk", "2 cups cooked oatmeal", "1/3 cup chopped dried apricots", "Vegetable or olive oil, for frying", "Honey, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 200 degrees.
