{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian Gumbo", "description": "This meatless gumbo has a distinct Louisiana flavor, thanks to the roux, Creole seasoning and the \u201choly trinity\u201d of Creole cooking (onion, celery, bell pepper). Gumbo is traditionally made with a variety of smoked meats and seafood, but this version gets an added bit of smokiness from an optional splash of liquid smoke. Here, the okra is roasted in the oven before being added to the pot, which eliminates the gooeyness. There is also no skimping on vegetables in this gumbo, and the red lentils thicken it while adding protein. Serving this gumbo over white rice helps make it a complete meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/05/dining/vl-veg-gumbo/vl-veg-gumbo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "creole, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "creole seasoning, hot sauce, okra, old bay seasoning, red lentils, kwanzaa, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1244}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (10- to 16-ounce) bag frozen sliced okra", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter or vegetable oil", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 yellow onion, diced", "2 celery ribs, thinly sliced", "1/2 green bell pepper, diced", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon Creole seasoning, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning", "1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes with their juices", "3 cups vegetable or chicken stock, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup red lentils", "1 tablespoon hot sauce, plus more to taste", "2 teaspoons liquid smoke (optional)", "Cooked white rice or quinoa, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
