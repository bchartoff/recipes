It\u2019s dead simple to make: While the pasta cooks and the beans marinate, saut\u00e9 the asparagus in olive oil, then use that pan to finish the dish. There\u2019s enough asparagus in the mix to make this a one-pan meal, but serving it with a crisp green salad on the side will add a little crunch and freshness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/04/dining/mc-lemony-pasta-with-asparagus/mc-lemony-pasta-with-asparagus-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, noodles, pastas", "keywords": "asparagus, lemon, parmesan, parsley, pasta, white beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 298}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large lemon, plus more fresh lemon juice for serving", "1 (15-ounce) can white beans, rinsed", "1 shallot, finely diced, or 2 tablespoons finely diced red onion", "3 garlic cloves (2 thinly sliced, 1 finely grated)", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste", "Kosher salt", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound short pasta, such as campanelle, fusilli or farfalle", "2 bunches asparagus (about 2 pounds), ends trimmed, stalks sliced into 1/2-inch pieces", "2/3 cup coarsely chopped Italian parsley leaves", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate the zest from the lemon into a small bowl.
