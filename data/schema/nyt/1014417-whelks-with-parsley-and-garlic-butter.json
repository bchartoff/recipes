In Europe, especially in England, where people eat lots of shelled creatures that might make Americans shudder, whelks are extremely popular.\n\nWhelks range in size from a couple of inches \u2014 a dozen or so in a pound \u2014 to eight or nine inches long. So-called common whelks are the smallest and the ones to seek at the fish market for their briny-sweet taste and only slight chewiness. Larger varieties, like the channeled whelk or the knobbed whelk, are usually sold as scungilli.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/12/19/dining/19SUBWHELKS_SPAN/19SUBWHELKS_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "appetizer, butter, garlic, whelks", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 8}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce garlic (about 7 cloves), germ (the green sprout) removed", "1 1/2 ounces flat-leaf parsley (about 1/2 bunch), heavy stems removed", "8 ounces (2 sticks) soft unsalted butter", "Salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "Pinch cayenne", "1 pound whelks (about 12), the smaller the better, scrubbed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a running food processor, drop garlic through feed tube to mince.
