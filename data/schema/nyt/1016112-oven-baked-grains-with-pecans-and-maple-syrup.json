It takes about 1 hour 10 minutes in the oven, so it might be more practical for a weekend breakfast. Grits are much like polenta, and traditionally served as a savory dish, often with cheese added. Here I mixed the grits with the higher-protein millet, and liked the texture of the mix as well as the nuttier flavor. I warmed leftovers in my toaster oven and enjoyed this throughout the week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/11/science/13recipehealth/13recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, quick", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 188, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "347 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup corn or hominy grits", "1/2 cup millet", "3/4 to 1 teaspoon salt (to taste)", "4 cups water", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup, or 1 tablespoon each, plus additional for drizzling", "1/3 cup chopped pecans, lightly toasted", "Optional: Milk for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a 9- or 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add grits and millet.
