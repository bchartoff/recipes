(\u201cKee mao\u201d means, roughly, \u201cdrunk-style,\u201d and dishes with that label are associated with late-night cravings and hangover prevention.) The finished dish should be fragrant, pungent and whatever means \u201chot\u201d to you: Deploy your chiles accordingly. Hong Thaimee, a chef in New York who grew up in Bangkok, employs a heavy Dutch oven, instead of a wok. (She said she was surprised to find that it worked better than a wok for Thai stir-fries on her tiny apartment stovetop, as its wide, flat bottom has more contact with the flame and holds onto more heat.) Fresh lime leaves are a popular addition; they are easy to buy online, along with fragrant Thai basil and, sometimes, holy basil. But in a pinch, Ms. Thaimee said, Italian basil and a garnish of lime zest are fine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/17padthairex3/merlin_203116365_994a1217-d3d5-40d9-b26b-a6718a450b67-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "noodles, main course", "keywords": "basil, oyster sauce, rice noodles", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1702}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces sen yai or other dried wide rice noodles", "2 to 4 green and red bird\u2019s-eye or other very hot chiles, such as serrano", "7 garlic cloves", "8 ounces ground pork or chicken, fresh seafood such as shrimp, mussels or calamari, or cubed extra-firm tofu", "6 gai lan (Chinese broccoli), choy sum, bok choy or broccolini, thick stems trimmed off\u00a0(optional)", "1 heaping cup lightly packed holy basil, Thai basil or Italian basil leaves", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil", "2 tablespoons oyster sauce", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons Thai black soy sauce or another thick, sweet soy sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the noodles: Place dried noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot tap water.
