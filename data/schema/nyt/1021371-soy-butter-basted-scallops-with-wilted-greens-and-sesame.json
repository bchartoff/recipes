{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soy-Butter Basted Scallops With Wilted Greens and Sesame", "description": "This simple dish was inspired by a recipe for steamed scallop and butter rice found in \u201cDonabe: Classic and Modern Japanese Clay Pot Cooking\u201d (Ten Speed, 2015) by Naoko Takei Moore and Kyle Connaughton. Here, sweet sea scallops are seared in a hot pan and basted with melted butter and soy sauce to finish cooking. Tender greens are saut\u00e9ed in garlic oil, then the scallops are placed on top and everything is drizzled with the remaining soy-butter and a bit of sesame oil. Finish the dish with a good squeeze of lime, thinly sliced scallions and a smattering of sesame seeds. It\u2019s wonderful served over steamed white rice, so be sure to get that on the stove before you begin cooking the scallops, as the rest of the meal comes together in no time at all.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/19/dining/ch-scallops-greens/merlin_174651789_59eb6831-2929-442e-a44f-212234527fc9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, seafood, main course", "keywords": "butter, garlic, lime, red pepper flakes, scallops, sesame oil, soy sauce, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 751}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large sea scallops, patted dry", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "1 1/2 pounds baby spinach or other tender greens", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "Lime wedges, for serving", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallion greens", "Sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)", "Steamed rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 200 degrees.
