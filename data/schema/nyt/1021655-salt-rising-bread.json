{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salt-Rising Bread", "description": "Salt-rising bread is an American technique with deep roots: Home bakers who developed the bread in Appalachia didn\u2019t have access to yeast, but found a way to bake without it when they noticed that their milk starters bubbled up overnight. It\u2019s much easier and far more consistent to get a good rise with yeast \u2014 even bakers who make salt-rising bread regularly have failures with the finicky technique. But those who continue the tradition are rewarded with light, tender, airy crumbed bread that makes a particularly delicious toast. Be sure to maintain the starter at an even temperature, as directed, or it won\u2019t take.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/22/magazine/22mag-Eat/22mag-Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT13H15M", "recipeYield": "1 (9-inch) loaf", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, breads", "keywords": "butter, cornmeal, flour, milk, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 419}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "1 tablespoon fine cornmeal", "4 cups/510 grams all-purpose flour", "1/8 teaspoon baking soda", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the loaf tin", "1 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium just until the edges start to bubble.
