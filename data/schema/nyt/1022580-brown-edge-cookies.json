{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown-Edge Cookies", "description": "These one-bowl cookies, sometimes known as crispies, are buttery like the Danish cookies in blue tins, tender in the middle like snickerdoodles and snappy like Scottish shortbread. But there\u2019s nothing else quite like them, and they go with everything. No one knows the exact provenance of the recipe, but Nabisco sold a similar cookie called brown-edge wafers until they discontinued production in 1996. This all-butter version is adapted from Millie Shea of Traverse City, Mich., who learned it from her mother in the 1930s. For best results, be sure to cream the butter and sugar until fluffy, and don\u2019t overbake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/24/dining/ml-brown-edged-cookies/merlin_194652042_8fdde8a7-8124-43c9-af00-d0eba7344585-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "About 4 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, cookies and bars, dessert", "keywords": "butter, flour, freezer friendly, make-ahead, one bowl, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 852}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/453 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1 pound/453 grams granulated sugar (2 1/4 cups)", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "3 cups/384 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon fine salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange two racks around the middle of the oven and heat oven to 375 degrees.
