{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cauliflower Gratin With Leeks and White Cheddar", "description": "A sort of cheater's gratin, this cauliflower cooked with leeks and cream doesn\u2019t require blanching or a b\u00e9chamel, making it a low maintenance, deeply comforting side dish. To skirt the blanching, the cauliflower and cream is covered in foil to give the vegetables a chance to get tender without drying out. The foil then comes off so the top can brown and the cream can reduce, creating a thick, velvety sauce. If your heart desires a crunchier texture, add a scattering of bread crumbs tossed in olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper when the aluminum foil comes off.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/14/dining/14cauliflowerrex3-copy/14cauliflowerrex3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "cauliflower, cheddar, leek, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1510}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "514 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small-ish head cauliflower (about 2 pounds),\u00a0green leaves removed", "Olive oil, for drizzling", "1 small leek, white and light green part only, very thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "\u00be cup heavy cream", "6 ounces sharp white Cheddar, grated (about 1 1/2 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
