Next time, try this one instead. It has all the usual players \u2013 olive oil, Parmesan, flaky sea salt \u2014 along with fried lemons for brightness and chile flakes for heat. Don\u2019t skip the step of blanching the lemon slices before frying. It may seem fussy, but it eliminates any bitterness in the lemon pith and takes only a few extra minutes. Then dry the lemon slices well before adding them to the hot oil; this helps them brown more deeply.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/10/multimedia/clark-pasta-with-lemons/clark-pasta-with-lemons-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weekday, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "lemon, linguine, parmigiano-reggiano, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3129}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 394, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "61 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "313 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 lemons", "1 pound linguine or spaghetti", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "Pinch of sugar", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3/4 teaspoon chile flakes, more to taste", "2/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, more to taste", "Black pepper, as needed", "1/2 cup celery leaves, coarsely chopped (optional)", "1/3 cup parsley, coarsely chopped (optional)", "Flaky sea salt, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
