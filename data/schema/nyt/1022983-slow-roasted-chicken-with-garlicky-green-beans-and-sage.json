{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Roasted Chicken With Garlicky Green Beans and Sage", "description": "This may look like just plain chicken and green beans, but by dropping the oven temperature to 325 degrees and slow roasting for 1\u00bd hours, these simple ingredients become so much more: The green beans, which are tossed with olive oil, sage and garlic, will no longer be snappy and bright green, but will slouch and sweeten. The chicken will be tender enough to pull apart with your fingers. (Its skin will be crisp but pale, so for browner skin, broil for a few minutes after roasting.) And the flavorful chicken drippings will mingle with the aromatics on the sheet pan, creating a spectacular, no-effort pan sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/14/dining/as-Slow-Roasted-Chicken-With-Garlicky-Green-Beans/as-Slow-Roasted-Chicken-With-Garlicky-Green-Beans-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken legs, garlic, green beans, sage", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 585}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds green beans, trimmed", "Cloves from 1 head garlic (about 10 cloves), smashed and peeled", "15 fresh sage leaves", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "2 1/2 to 3 pounds chicken leg quarters or bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, patted dry", "1 teaspoon sherry vinegar, apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
