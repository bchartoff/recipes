{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chiles Anchos Rellenos de Queso", "description": "Well known in Mexico and the United States, chiles rellenos are most often thought of as featuring charred, batter-fried and stuffed fresh poblanos, but dried chiles are also commonly used. Dried poblanos, called anchos, are similar in texture and flavor to dried apricots but with a smoky, slight spicy finish. Soft, pliable and mildly sweet, they can be stuffed without having to be charred and peeled.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.

Carefully stuff each with a slice of panela. If you have large chiles, you may need more than 1 slice. Close the chiles and bring together their edges.

Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat the egg whites and 1/4 teaspoon salt on high speed until you get stiff peaks, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce speed to low, drizzle in yolks, and beat until no streaks of white remain.

Carefully lay the chile in the oil, point side first and away from you. (This way, if you drop the chile, the oil will splash away from you.) Use a heatproof metal spoon to baste the top of the chile with hot oil for about 20 seconds. This will seal the surface, and the batter will start to puff and turn very light golden. Fry until chiles are golden brown on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set over paper towels to drain.
