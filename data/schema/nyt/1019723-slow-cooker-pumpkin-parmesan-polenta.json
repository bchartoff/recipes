{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Pumpkin-Parmesan Polenta", "description": "This tangy polenta, inspired by the flavors of pumpkin ravioli, is as an easy side dish that can be made on the stovetop or in the slow cooker. For something a little lighter, omit the butter that cooks with the polenta and reduce the browned butter to 1/2 stick, or 4 tablespoons, or halve the recipe if you're not serving a crowd. At first, there will seem to be too much liquid, but the nice thing about cooking polenta in the slow cooker is the grain has time to hydrate, plumping and absorbing the water. When you whisk in the cream cheese at the very end, the texture should be glossy and creamy \u2014 loose enough to expand slowly when ladled onto a platter but not runny. If it's too liquidy for you, let it sit with the lid off for a few minutes and then whisk it more. If it's too thick, whisk in some boiling water.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/dining/sg-polenta/sg-polenta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "About 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "fall, winter, nutmeg, parmesan, polenta, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, sage, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 206}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 506, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "558 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/12 ounces traditional or stone-ground polenta (not instant or quick-cooking)", "2 (15-ounce) cans pumpkin pur\u00e9e", "12 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks)", "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "Black pepper", "1 thyme\u00a0sprig", "1 bunch fresh sage\u00a0(5 to 8 sprigs)", "1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, plus more for topping", "8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature", "10 ounces grated Parmesan\u00a0(about 3 cups), plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Slow Cooker Method", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, whisk together the polenta with 10 cups of water, then whisk in the pumpkin.
