{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Sausage, Caramelized Cabbage and Goat Cheese", "description": "Pasta with cabbage is a common combination across much of Central and Eastern Europe. In this quick weeknight meal, an entire head of cabbage is cooked in the fat left behind by sweet Italian sausage. Goat cheese adds tang and helps create a cream sauce that ties everything together. Feel free to use this recipe as a guideline to come up with your own variation: Try it with your favorite shape of pasta, swap out the thyme for dill, parsley or another herb, or substitute the goat cheese for Parmesan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Aaron Hutcherson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/dining/ah-sausage-and-cabbage-pasta/ah-sausage-and-cabbage-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas, main course", "keywords": "cabbage, goat cheese, italian sausage, pasta, sausage, thyme", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 681}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 ounces dry rotini or other shaped pasta", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "8 ounces sweet Italian sausage, casings removed", "1 small head savoy cabbage (about 1 1/2 pounds), quartered, cored and thinly sliced", "1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves", "1 cup heavy cream", "4 ounces goat cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil.
