For the dressing: Though you could use a raw egg yolk and slowly stream in oil while whisking constantly, relying on the already emulsifying qualities of store-bought mayonnaise gets you to creamy heights with less fuss. This salad does not keep well, so serve it immediately, while the radicchio is still plump and crunchy. There\u2019s no added salt in this recipe, as the many anchovies season both the bread crumbs and the dressing. But should your radicchio be especially bitter \u2014 pleasant though that flavor can be \u2014 feel free to add a pinch of salt to help tame the bitterness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/EK-Radicchio-Caesar-Salad-15SALADREX/EK-Radicchio-Caesar-Salad-15SALADREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "anchovies, parmesan, radicchio, worcestershire sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 115}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (2-ounce) tin flat anchovy fillets packed in olive oil", "1/2 cup coarse or panko bread crumbs", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon mayonnaise", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus more if needed", "1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce", "2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan, plus more for topping", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 large head or 2 small heads radicchio (1 pound), any wilted outer leaves removed, quartered lengthwise, cored and leaves separated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the bread crumbs: Add all of the anchovy oil from the tin (about 2 tablespoons) to a large skillet.
