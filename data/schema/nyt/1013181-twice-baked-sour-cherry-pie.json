In a quirk of pie-making tradition, open-faced pies, like custards, chocolate cream or pumpkin chiffon, get the best crust \u2014 pre-baked shells that are flaky, crisp and golden. But fruit pies, baked with raw dough that is often pale and soggy, get short shrift. For a fruit-pie crust that is crunchy and flaky, with a buttery texture that absorbs the fruit\u2019s juices without turning to mush, the secret is pre-baking the bottom crust, then adding the fruit, covering it with raw dough and baking it again.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/17/dining/cherrypie-still/cherrypie-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, sour cherry, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 341}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 486, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "98 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, more for rolling out dough", "3/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "15 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into pieces", "1 cup sugar", "2 to 3 tablespoons instant tapioca", "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon", "2 pounds sour cherries (about 6 cups), rinsed and pitted", "1 tablespoon kirsch or brandy", "3 tablespoons heavy cream", "Demerara sugar, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make dough: in bowl of a food processor pulse together flour and salt just to combine.
