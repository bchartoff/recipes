{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Rice With Shrimp, Bacon and Corn", "description": "This one-pan recipe is a great use of leftover rice, though you can also use freshly cooked rice as long it\u2019s no longer hot. The starch in sticky short-grain rice, together with the corn\u2019s starch, caramelize into a nice crust that you can remove in big pieces. Long-grain rice will brown as well, but stay loose when served. Try to get a little of everything in each bite: crisp yet tender rice and corn, savory shrimp, crunchy bacon, juicy tomatoes. This recipe was developed with 16/20-count shrimp in mind, but you can use whatever shrimp you find aside from fancy super-jumbo ones. Serve with hot sauce if you\u2019d like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/19/dining/ko-crispy-rice-shrimp/ko-crispy-rice-shrimp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, weeknight, grains and rice, seafood", "keywords": "corn, rice, shrimp, tomatoes, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 747}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 521, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1027 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp, patted very dry", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper", "4 strips bacon", "3 ears corn", "6 scallions", "1 cup grape tomatoes, or 1 large chopped juicy tomato", "4 cups cooked rice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in large cast-iron skillet or other heavy skillet over high heat.
