{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butter Chicken", "description": "Butter chicken is the General Tso\u2019s of Indian food, a great, ever-evolving, cross-continental dish found in Delhi, London, New York, Perth and most points in between. In its purest form, it is yogurt-and-spice-marinated chicken dressed in a velvety red bath comprising butter, onions, ginger and tomatoes scented with garam masala, cumin and turmeric, with a cinnamon tang. This version was adapted from Amandeep, a young kitchen hand at the restaurant Attica, in Melbourne, Australia, who used to make it for staff meal. It is wildly luxurious. Serve with basmati rice and mango chutney, with papadums or naan if you can find them, with extra rice if you cannot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/24/magazine/24eat/mag-24Eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday", "keywords": "chicken thighs, garam masala, greek yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3888}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1017, "unsaturatedFatContent": "40 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "85 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "sodiumContent": "1197 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups full-fat Greek yogurt", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 1/2 tablespoons ground turmeric", "2 tablespoons garam masala", "2 tablespoons ground cumin", "3 pounds chicken thighs, on the bone", "1/4 pound unsalted butter", "4 teaspoons neutral oil, like vegetable or canola oil", "2 medium-size yellow onions, peeled and diced", "4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "3 tablespoons fresh ginger, peeled and grated or finely diced", "1 tablespoon cumin seeds", "1 cinnamon stick", "2 medium-size tomatoes, diced", "2 red chiles, like Anaheim, or 1 jalape\u00f1o pepper, seeded and diced", "Kosher salt to taste", "2/3 cup chicken stock, low-sodium or homemade", "1 1/2 cups cream", "1 1/2 teaspoons tomato paste", "3 tablespoons ground almonds, or finely chopped almonds", "1/2 bunch cilantro leaves, stems removed."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, turmeric, garam masala and cumin in a large bowl.
