{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Striped Bass With Charred Kale and Yellow Squash", "description": "Grilling striped bass is a great way to cook the fish because the skin takes on a char that goes well with other strong flavors like oregano-laden chimichurri sauce. Usually paired with meat, chimichurri plays off of bass just as beautifully, as long as you use a light vinegar like champagne or rice wine, rather than balsamic. In preparing the fish, make sure the grill is hot first and be patient about flipping \u2014 you usually want about 4 minutes per side for a 7 to 8 ounce piece. Drop some local lacinato kale and thinly sliced yellow squash onto the grill as well for a charred vegetable side.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Schwarz And Greg Kessler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/Bass2/Bass2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "kale, striped bass, yellow squash, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 16}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds striped bass, cut into four equal fillets", "2 yellow squash", "2 bunches lacinato kale, stems removed", "\u00bc cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for coating fish and vegetables", "Juice of one lemon", "1 teaspoon red chili flakes", "Salt", "Chimichurri sauce (see <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1015299/chimichurri-sauce.html'>recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a hot grill."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Coat the fish fillets with a few tablespoons of olive oil.
