{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Steel-Cut Oats", "description": "This is a practically effortless way to have a hot breakfast ready to go the moment you wake up. The trick to cooking perfect steel-cut oats in the slow cooker is to make use of the auto-warm setting, which switches on when the set cook time is over. (The majority of modern slow cookers have this function, though some older ones may not.) Cooking the oatmeal on low for two hours, then on warm for up to six more ensures very creamy, risotto-like oats that have a pleasant chew. (You can also cook the oats on low for 4 hours, then immediately serve, but if you venture any longer than that, the oats may overcook.) Think of this as a whole-grain meal that you can take in any sweet or savory direction you like: Top with a pat of butter and a squeeze of honey, or a sprinkle of salt and a bit of hot sauce, or any of the topping suggestions below.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/19/dining/sdg-slow-cooker-oats/merlin_185734722_7124f044-ef63-4d05-b6b0-24018dfe32ba-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, main course", "keywords": "oatmeal, salt, slow cooker, steel-cut oats", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 355}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup steel-cut oats", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "Toppings, optional (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the oats, salt and 4 cups water.
