{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bulgogi Cheese Steaks", "description": "These sandwiches, which are inspired by Philly cheese steaks, are made with beef marinated in classic Korean barbecue flavors. Tender rib-eye steak is thinly sliced and pounded to mimic the texture of shaved meat, then tossed in a savory garlic-soy marinade. Thin-skinned shishito peppers, a common ingredient in Korean cuisine, stand in for traditional bell peppers. Shishito peppers vary in spiciness, so once blistered, they will add mild, or sometimes bold, heat to the sandwiches. Rib-eye creates the juiciest sandwiches, but sirloin is more affordable, and a solid substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/07/dining/kc-bulgogi-cheesesteak/merlin_188547162_26c86e62-d910-416d-a6ef-b08134e984b5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "beef, hoagie rolls, rib eye steak, shishito, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 334}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless rib-eye steak, sliced crosswise 1/8-inch-thick", "1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped scallions (from about 6 large scallions)", "3 tablespoons turbinado sugar", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "1 teaspoon black pepper, plus more for seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "1/2 cup safflower or canola oil", "1 large yellow onion, halved and sliced 1/4-inch-thick (about 2 cups)", "8 ounces shishito peppers, stemmed and halved lengthwise", "Kosher salt", "4 (10-inch) hoagie rolls, split lengthwise", "8 slices American cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange meat in a single layer on a large cutting board.
