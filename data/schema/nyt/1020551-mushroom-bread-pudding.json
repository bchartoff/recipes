{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom Bread Pudding", "description": "Wonderful served as a brunch centerpiece or as a holiday side, this rich vegetarian casserole can be assembled in advance, refrigerated overnight, then baked just before serving. You could certainly prepare it day-of and let the bread soak for 15 minutes before baking, but allowing it to sit overnight will make it more tender. Delicate brioche is the ideal bread for this pudding, and it is available in most supermarkets, often in the form of hamburger rolls, which are a good size and shape for this dish. Challah is also a good option, but it\u2019s a bit denser, so it may take more than 15 minutes for it to soak up the custard.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/dining/ss-mushroom-bread-pudding/merlin_162801066_654c88c5-5bef-46fa-955e-a75046eb66c7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, casseroles, custards and puddings, vegetables", "keywords": "brioche, dried porcini mushrooms, leek, mushroom, sage, shallot, fall, winter, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1043}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "1/2 pound mixed fresh mushrooms, such as cremini or shiitake, trimmed and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "8 fresh sage leaves, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish, if desired", "2 small shallots, halved and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons cognac (optional)", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "Black pepper", "3 large leeks, white and pale green parts only, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced and well washed", "6 large eggs", "1 1/2 cups heavy cream", "1 1/2 cups whole milk", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "2 ounces grated Gruy\u00e8re (about 1 cup)", "12 ounces brioche (or 4 to 6 large brioche buns), cut into 1/2-inch thick slices", "1 ounce finely grated Parmesan (about 1/2 cup)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Boil 1 cup of water in a small saucepan.
