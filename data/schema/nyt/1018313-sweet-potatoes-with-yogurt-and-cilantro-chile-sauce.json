{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potatoes With Yogurt and Cilantro-Chile Sauce", "description": "In this luscious vegetable dish, velvety sweet potatoes get a spicy jolt from a chile-spiked cilantro sauce spooned on top. Greek yogurt adds a creamy element and a bit of protein if you\u2019re serving these as a vegetarian main course. As a side dish, they are satisfying yet not the least bit heavy, thanks to the bright flavors of the sauce. You can make the sauce up to 4 hours ahead. Any longer than that and it starts to lose its fresh, tart taste. It\u2019s also very good on roasted carrots.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28DIANA-HENRY6-WEB/28DIANA-HENRY6-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 side dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cilantro, greek yogurt, green chili, honey, sweet potato, gluten-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 387}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 414, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "670 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup plus 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "1/2 tablespoon honey", "Juice of 2 limes", "Kosher salt, to taste", "Black pepper, to taste", "2 1/4 pounds sweet potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1-inch wedges", "1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves only (1/2 ounce)", "2 green chiles, seeded and chopped", "2 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced", "2 tablespoons sliced blanched almonds", "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar", "1 cup Greek yogurt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup oil, the honey, juice from 1 lime, a large pinch of salt and pepper to taste, and toss with potato wedges.
