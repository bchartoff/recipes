Here, the chicken fat is smartly used to saut\u00e9 shallots until just softened. (They're finished off with the chicken, melting down in the sauce.) If you don't like spicy, don't fret: A showering of fresh herbs and a good squeeze of lime nicely cuts the heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/harissa-chicken-horizontal/harissa-chicken-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, cilantro, harissa, shallot, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 613}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 508, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "743 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "4 to 5 small shallots, ends trimmed, quartered, root to stem, and peeled", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons harissa", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 to 1 1/2 cups chicken stock, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "1 lime, cut into wedges, for serving", "Flaky salt, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season chicken thighs well with salt and pepper.
