It came to be when T.J. Siegal, a friend and colleague of Sasha Petraske, the founder of Milk & Honey, came in one night and asked for a whiskey sour. Spying a batch of honey syrup Mr. Petraske had whipped up for a different cocktail, Mr. Siegal asked for his drink to be made with that instead of sugar. The winning result, silkier and richer in flavor than the average whiskey sour, was soon served to customers.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/31/dining/25honey1/merlin_185308143_682a1f6e-5382-4550-a5df-be693a7853ab-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink, plus additional honey syrup", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bourbon, honey, lemon, lemon juice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 669}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces honey", "1 ounce warm water", "Ice", "2 ounces bourbon", "3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice", "3/4 ounce honey syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the honey syrup: In a sealed container, combine the honey and warm water; shake until combined.
