(The low-knead loaf is itself inspired by Jim Lahey's influential <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread\">no-knead bread recipe</a>.) For a softer, richer loaf, replace up to 100 grams of water with 100 grams of whole milk. For a glossy brown crust, whisk 1 egg with a couple tablespoons of water and brush it over the top of the proofed loaf with a pastry brush just before placing it in the oven. You can sprinkle the loaf with coarse sea salt, spices like caraway or cumin, or seeds, such as sunflower, sesame or pepitas, after brushing on the egg wash.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.

The dough should look very wet and sloppy. Dip your hands briefly in a bowl of water, then shake off the excess. Using one hand, scoop your fingers under one side of the dough to the very bottom of the bowl and, working quickly, lift that side, stretch it a few inches, and fold it over to the opposite side.
