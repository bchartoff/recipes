{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Savory Corn Fritters", "description": "These corn fritters use fresh, whole kernels, mixed with spices, scallions and a simple batter. Corn fritters come in many types, from the cornmeal-based, deep-fried hush puppies, to the more patty-shaped, pan-fried fritters. Pan-seared in hot oil until crisp, these patty-like fritters contain Cheddar, which adds creaminess while still allowing the crunchy corn kernels to provide a pop of sweet flavor and texture with each bite. Fritters make an excellent side for a cookout, as they stand up to smoky barbecue flavors and can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature. Leftovers make an excellent breakfast, with a dollop of sour cream or plain yogurt on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/04/dining/vl-corn-fritters/merlin_176509986_f0ab7032-28c8-48a7-85d0-c1eb067ef9dc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "18 fritters", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "cheddar, corn, corn kernels, egg, milk, scallion, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1460}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large eggs", "2/3 cup whole milk", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "3 cups corn kernels, fresh or frozen and thawed (about 1 pound)", "1/4 cup chopped scallion greens", "1 cup sharp Cheddar, shredded", "Vegetable oil, coconut oil or shortening, for frying"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, garlic powder, black pepper and ground cayenne.
