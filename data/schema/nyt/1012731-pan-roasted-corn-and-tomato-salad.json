My version here marries corn and tomatoes with chile, avocado, cilantro and lime. It is just plain good. At the end, you\u2019ve got meaty smokiness from bacon; that incredible sweetness of corn; the fruity acidity of tomato; the tender, smooth fattiness of avocado, and the sharpness of chile. It\u2019s a summer winner, one that you shouldn\u2019t even try after the first frost.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/22/dining/summersalad-still/summersalad-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southwestern", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, one pot", "keywords": "bacon, corn, tomato, gluten-free, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 167}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 311, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "692 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 pound bacon, chopped", "1 small red onion, chopped", "4 to 6 ears corn, stripped of their kernels (2 to 3 cups)", "Juice of 1 lime, or more to taste", "2 cups cored and chopped tomatoes", "1 medium ripe avocado, pitted, peeled and chopped", "2 fresh small chilies, like Thai, seeded and minced", "Salt", "black pepper", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, more or less"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to render fat; add onion and cook until just softened, about 5 minutes, then add corn.
