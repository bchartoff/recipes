{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry-Pecan Cobbler", "description": "This recipe came to The Times in a 1999 article by Florence Fabricant in which she argued for replacing the ubiquitous Thanksgiving pie with a cobbler. Why? The pastry stays crisp, there's a greater fruit-to-crust ratio and perhaps most importantly, it's easier. Here, two Thanksgiving favorites \u2013 cranberries and pecans \u2013 are piled into a baking dish, topped with cornmeal biscuits then baked until golden. (This can be made early in the day and reheated to serve warm. Or it can be frozen, then defrosted and warmed, but is best if not refrigerated overnight.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-CRANBERRYPIE/19COOKING-CRANBERRYPIE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "cranberry, pecan, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespooons melted unsalted butter", "4 1/2 cups cranberries", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans", "1 1/3 cups light brown sugar", "1 1/2 tablespoons flour, plus flour for work surface", "1/3 cup fresh orange juice", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Cornmeal biscuit dough (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/317-cornmeal-biscuit-dough\">see recipe</a>)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
