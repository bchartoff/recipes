{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian Meatballs", "description": "Seasoned with Parmesan, ricotta, fennel seeds and oregano, these meat-free Italian meatballs capture all the flavors of the classic. Cremini mushrooms and chickpeas mimic the texture of ground beef, bulgur helps bind the mixture together, and ricotta keeps it tender. The balls are rolled in a light coating of bread crumbs and Parmesan that crisps as it bakes, but if you prefer a saucy meatball, skip the coating and simply bake until firm, then simmer in marinara. Any extra coating mixture can be toasted in the oven and sprinkled over roasted veggies or creamy pastas. Leftover meatballs can be frozen and reheated in a 425-degree oven until warmed through, about 15 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": ""}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/13/dining/kc-vegetarian-meatballs/kc-vegetarian-meatballs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "24 meatballs", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, finger foods, meatballs, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, bread crumbs, bulgur, chickpea, cremini, marinara sauce, mushroom, parmesan, ricotta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons bulgur wheat", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup plus 1/3 cup seasoned Italian bread crumbs", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (about 2 ounces)", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "4 medium cremini mushrooms, stemmed and quartered", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 large egg", "1/4 cup ricotta (about 2 ounces)", "1 teaspoon fennel seeds", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 cup marinara sauce, warmed, for dipping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
