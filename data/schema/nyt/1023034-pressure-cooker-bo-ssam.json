{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Bo Ssam", "description": "Bo ssam is a Korean dish featuring boiled pork belly or shoulder that\u2019s slowly braised in an aromatic broth until incredibly tender. While the dish traditionally takes hours to prepare, a pressure cooker can turn it into a festive weeknight meal. For the best bite, wrap the rich pork in small bundles of napa cabbage leaves and dollop with ssamjang and other spicy condiments, like the piquant radish salad, which comes together quickly and lasts a week in the fridge, or serve this dish with store-bought kimchi, a tasty alternative and time saver. Leftover pork can be chopped up for a flavorful fried rice or tossed with pasta and grated Parm for a comforting meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/08/dining/kc-pressure-cooker-bossam/merlin_203116221_1406efd9-d893-4315-b14f-e3c63248b226-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, finger foods, meat, main course", "keywords": "cabbage, ginger, instant pot, pork belly, radish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 109}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons doenjang (Korean fermented soybean paste)", "1 head garlic, halved crosswise", "1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and sliced", "5 scallions, trimmed and halved crosswise", "1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "3 to 3 1/2 pounds pork belly, cut into 2-inch-thick lengths", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 pound inner napa cabbage leaves, separated (reserve larger outer leaves for another use)", "Thinly sliced long green chile peppers, thinly sliced garlic and kimchi, for serving (optional)", "8 ounces Korean radish or daikon, peeled and julienned (2 packed cups)", "1 tablespoon gochugaru (Korean red-pepper flakes)", "1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon minced garlic", "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/4 cup doenjang", "1 tablespoon gochujang", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the bo ssam: In a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker, combine 4 cups of water and doenjang, and whisk until well blended.
