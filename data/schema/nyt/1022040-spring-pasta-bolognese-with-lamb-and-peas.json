{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Pasta Bolognese With Lamb and Peas", "description": "This recipe is inspired by springtime and Bolognese bianco, or white Bolognese, a hearty Italian meat sauce made without tomato. It calls for ground lamb, but you can also use beef, pork or veal. The addition of cream to the simmering broth helps tenderize the lamb, and gives the sauce body. Incorporating starchy pasta water, then stirring it vigorously, creates a glossy, thick coating. Spinach, peas and lemon provide fresh, bright notes that balance the rich Bolognese. If fresh peas are available, cook them in the sauce for a few minutes before stirring in the spinach.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/29/dining/kc-spring-lamb-pasta/merlin_185502138_e5a73c3e-aff4-4de0-91a9-4c00a84af200-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas, main course", "keywords": "ground lamb, lamb, lemon, peas, rosemary, spinach, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1438}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup finely chopped yellow onion", "1 cup finely chopped carrot", "6 garlic cloves, minced (about 2 tablespoons)", "1 pound ground lamb (or ground beef, pork or veal)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1 large fresh rosemary sprig", "1 pound spaghetti", "1 cup thawed frozen peas (about 5 ounces)", "5 ounces fresh baby spinach", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (about 2 ounces), plus more for garnish", "1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium.
