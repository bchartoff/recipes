{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turmeric-Black Pepper Chicken With Asparagus", "description": "In this sweet and spicy stir-fry, black pepper, honey and rice vinegar help accentuate turmeric\u2019s delightfully earthy qualities. Thinly sliced asparagus doesn\u2019t need much time to cook, but feel free to swap with any other vegetables that cook in just a few minutes, like thinly sliced green beans, frozen peas or baby spinach. Serve this with rice or rice vermicelli noodles, or tuck it into a lettuce cup or pita with yogurt and fresh herbs. You could also trade the chicken for tofu, shrimp or cubed pork shoulder.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/26/dining/as-turmeric-chicken/merlin_170459076_be9517b6-6c9d-47f1-bb27-843d6c777088-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday, poultry, vegetables", "keywords": "asparagus, chicken, honey, lime, pepper, rice vinegar, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 284}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons honey", "3/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 tablespoon coconut or canola oil", "12 ounces asparagus, trimmed and thinly sliced on an angle", "1 teaspoon unseasoned rice vinegar (optional)", "1 lime, cut into wedges (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl or measuring cup, stir together 1/4 cup water with the honey, pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt; set honey mixture aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt.
