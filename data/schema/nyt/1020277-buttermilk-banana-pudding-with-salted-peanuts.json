{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttermilk Banana Pudding With Salted Peanuts", "description": "Banana pudding typically sits on the sweeter side of the dessert spectrum. Despite layers of instant pudding, vanilla cookies, sliced bananas and meringue or whipped cream, the sweet snack can feel a little one-note. But with a few simple tweaks and some new ingredients, it can feel fresh. The addition of buttermilk gives the custard a tangy zip of acidity, and tossing the Nilla Wafers with salted brown butter imparts a nutty, caramel-like flavor. Sour cream is incorporated into the whipped-cream topping, which helps the heavy cream stay firm while refrigerated and turning this into a fail-proof make-ahead dish. Garnishing the top with some more crushed cookies and chopped salted peanuts provides the pudding with crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Grant Melton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/gm-banana-pudding/gm-banana-pudding-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, custards and puddings", "keywords": "banana, buttermilk, heavy cream, peanut, vanilla, dessert, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 128}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups whole milk", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "4 egg yolks", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup buttermilk", "4 tablespoons salted butter (1/2 stick)", "1 (11-ounce) box vanilla wafer cookies, such as Nilla Wafers", "1 1/2 cups heavy cream", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1/2 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar", "4 large bananas, sliced", "1/2 cup salted peanuts, chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pudding: Add milk, heavy cream and vanilla extract to a medium saucepan and heat over medium.
