{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Utica Greens", "description": "This dish was popularized by Joe Morelle in the late 1980s at the Chesterfield Restaurant in Utica, N.Y., where it is on the menu as greens Morelle. More widely known as Utica greens, it has become commonplace, in modified versions, in Italian restaurants throughout central New York, and even migrated to New York City, Las Vegas and Florida. This version of the dish is fairly spicy. Use fewer cherry peppers if you prefer it less hot. You will have leftover oreganato, the topping of bread crumbs and cheese; use it for another greens dish or add it to baked chicken or shrimp. Typically served in restaurants as an appetizer, Utica greens makes a great main course at home with some crusty bread and a glass of red wine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jim Shahin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/01/dining/01UTICA2/01UTICA2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bread crumbs, cherry peppers, escarole, parmigiano-reggiano", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 478}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 512, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "787 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup bread crumbs", "1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated", "1 head escarole, about 1 1/4 pound, bottom removed,\u00a0leaves separated and\u00a0washed thoroughly to remove grit", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 slices prosciutto (about 2 ounces), sliced thin and cut into roughly 1-inch squares", "4 to 6 hot cherry peppers (pickled will do if you can't find fresh), tops and seeds removed, broken by hand or chopped into 4 or 5 chunks", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated, plus 2 or more tablespoons for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat.
