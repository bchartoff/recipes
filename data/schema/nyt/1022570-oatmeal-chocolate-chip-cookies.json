{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies", "description": "These taste distinctly homemade: much smaller than giant, thick bakery-style disks and more delicate, with just enough buttery dough to bind the chocolate and oats. Mixing by hand turns out cookies that are crisp at the edges and tender in the centers. These can be mixed and baked in under an hour, but the dough balls also can be packed in an airtight container and refrigerated for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to a month. You can bake them from ice-cold, though they\u2019ll need a few more minutes to turn golden brown.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/22/dining/21Korex2-cookies/merlin_194652099_18c799a4-c890-48d5-9afd-1d8e7b4b8812-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dessert", "keywords": "chocolate chip cookie, freezer friendly, make-ahead, rolled oats, semisweet chocolate chips", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2458}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/100 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "8 tablespoons/114 grams unsalted butter, softened", "1/2 cup/94 grams packed brown sugar", "1/4 cup/59 grams granulated sugar", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons heavy cream or milk", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1 1/4 cups/134 grams old-fashioned rolled oats", "1 cup/189 grams semi-sweet chocolate chips", "1/2 cup/63 grams chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
