{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Poppy Seed Tea Cake", "description": "Poppy seeds belong to the small-but-mighty clan of ingredients: Their flavor is nutty, their aroma earthy, and their color, a gorgeous blue-black, dramatic. Even though they\u2019re minuscule, they crack pleasantly under a light bite. Sprinkle poppy seeds over something sweet or savory and you add interest. Give the seeds a star turn and you add surprise. Although this simple loaf cake includes vanilla extract and lemon juice, it\u2019s the flavor that you get from an abundance of poppy seeds that brings everyone back for more. The cake can be served plain, but it\u2019s pretty spread with white icing and speckled with seeds. Remember that because poppy seeds are oily, they can go rancid \u2014 store them in the freezer and taste a few before using them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/09/magazine/09mag-eat-site/09mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "heavy cream, lemon zest, loaf cake, poppy seed", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1420}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 1/2 tablespoons/78 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus softened butter for the pan", "1 1/2 cups/192 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon or 1 tangerine, plus 2 tablespoons juice", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/47 grams poppy seeds", "1 cup/120 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon poppy seeds, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Center a rack in the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees.
