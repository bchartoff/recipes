{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pear Smoothie With Spinach, Celery and Ginger", "description": "This began as a \u201cclean out the refrigerator and (aging) fruit bowl\u201d smoothie.  I salvaged some spinach that had seen better days and finally used up the last of the pears I\u2019d bought a few weeks ago for another set of recipe tests. I went out to my garden and grabbed some bolting arugula and some mint. I\u2019ve been drinking  kefir, a fermented milk product much like yogurt but thinner and tangier, so that went in, giving the smoothie  a pleasantly  acidic edge. The two ingredients that the drink needs in order for it to taste like something other than a bland green drink are the half banana and the ginger. If you let your bananas ripen completely, then freeze them, they\u2019ll contribute not only flavor, sweetness and texture but also ice to your smoothies.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/29/science/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "1 generous serving", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 90}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 330, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "151 milligrams", "sugarContent": "39 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup washed spinach leaves (baby or bunch)", "1 ripe pear, peeled, quartered, cored and cut in chunks", "1/4 cup chopped celery", "1 quarter-size slice fresh ginger, peeled", "A handful of baby arugula", "1 to 2 tablespoons mint leaves (to taste)", "1/2 teaspoon chia seeds", "1/2 banana (50 g), frozen if possible, sliced", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon honey or agave nectar", "1 cup plain kefir or yogurt", "1 or 2 ice cubes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in a blender and blend at high speed for 1 minute, or until smooth.
