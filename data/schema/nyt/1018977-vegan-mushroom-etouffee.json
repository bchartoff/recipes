The seaweed called dulse brings a smoky, savory note and a mix of Creole and Old Bay seasoning provides the familiar flavors. Ms. Claiborne suggests spooning this over brown rice instead of the traditional white.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/29/dining/29VeganRex1/29VeganRex1-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday", "keywords": "brown rice, dulse flakes, grapeseed oil, oyster mushroom, fall, spring, winter, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 175}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 157, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "413 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons grapeseed or coconut oil", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 small yellow onion, diced", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 small green bell pepper, diced", "2 celery stalks, diced (about 1 cup)", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 cup diced tomatoes, canned or fresh", "2 1/2 cups vegetable stock or water (if using water, add 1 vegetable bouillon cube)", "1 dried bay leaf", "1 teaspoon dulse (seaweed) flakes", "1 tablespoon Creole seasoning or 1 teaspoon each black pepper, paprika, and dried thyme", "1 tablespoon Old Bay seasoning, more to taste", "1 pound fresh oyster mushrooms, trimmed and roughly chopped (about 2 cups)", "Freshly cooked brown rice, for serving", "Lemon wedges, for serving", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat the oil over medium heat until it ripples, then sprinkle in the flour.
