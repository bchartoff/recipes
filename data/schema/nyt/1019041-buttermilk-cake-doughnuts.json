{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttermilk Cake Doughnuts", "description": "Making doughnuts at home might seem like a dream, but it\u2019s an attainable dream. Golden brown on the outside with a tender, cake-like crumb inside, these classic cake-style doughnuts rely on buttermilk and baking powder for their lift and rise. The dough is slightly sticky, but resist the urge to over-flour and over-knead. Like working with biscuits, the dough must be handled delicately or the doughnuts will have difficulty rising as they fry, becoming tough and dense. Be sure to use a thermometer to determine the temperature of oil \u2013 too hot and the doughnuts get too dark before cooking all the way through; not hot enough, they\u2019ll be greasy without that signature rise. These versatile cake doughnuts can be glazed, dusted in powdered sugar or tossed to coat in cinnamon sugar, but are their absolute best soon after they\u2019re fried.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/20/dining/20COOKING-BUTTERMILK-DOUGHNUTS1/20COOKING-BUTTERMILK-DOUGHNUTS1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 doughnuts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, snack, pastries", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 197}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 716, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "106 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "416 milligrams", "sugarContent": "69 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/960 milliliters vegetable oil, for frying, plus 3 tablespoons", "2 2/3 cups/339 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed \u00a0", "1/2 cup/101 grams granulated sugar", "2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg", "1/2 cup/113 grams sour cream", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters buttermilk", "1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk", "2 cups/204 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters buttermilk, milk or water, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "Sprinkles, toasted coconut flakes or chopped nuts, such as pecans, pistachios or hazelnuts", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 cup/47 grams cocoa powder", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters buttermilk, milk or water, plus more as needed", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "Sprinkles, toasted coconut flakes, flaky salt or chopped nuts, such as pecans, pistachios or hazelnuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the doughnuts: Heat 4 cups/960 milliliters of oil in a large heavy bottomed pot (preferably wider than taller) over medium heat to 375 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, kosher salt and nutmeg."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together sour cream, buttermilk, egg, egg yolk and 3 tablespoons oil.
