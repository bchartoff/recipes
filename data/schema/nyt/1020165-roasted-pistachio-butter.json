{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Pistachio Butter", "description": "Pistachios contain less fat than other nuts, but they are still packed with protein and flavor, making them a fantastic choice for nut butter. Some brands contain sugar or hydrogenated oil, but you can make your own with just nuts \u2014 and maybe 1/4 cup pumpkin or sunflower seeds. For deeper flavor, roast the raw pistachios before blending. The seeds add a satisfying crunch and a more intense nut flavor, while a pinch of ground cardamom takes pistachio butter in a new direction. Swirl the finished product into your breakfast oatmeal or smoothie.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/09/dining/kc-pistachio-nut-butter/kc-pistachio-nut-butter-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "1 3/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "pistachio, pumpkin seeds, salt, sunflower seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 7}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 259, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "0 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound shelled raw pistachios (about 3 cups)", "Kosher salt (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
