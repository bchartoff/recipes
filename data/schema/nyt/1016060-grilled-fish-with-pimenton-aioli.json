It can be hot (though not super hot) or mild (which is called \u201csweet,\u201d though the flavor is more bitter than anything else). Whether you know it or not, you\u2019ve probably eaten it: it\u2019s the dominant spice in chorizo. It\u2019s also among the best examples of how appealing the addition of smoke can be. Here it goes on both the fish you\u2019re going to grill and in the aioli you\u2019re going to use to accompany it. The combination is outstanding.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/20/dining/recipes-grilledswordfishpimenton/recipes-grilledswordfishpimenton-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "spanish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick", "keywords": "main course, pimenton, swordfish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 166}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons minced garlic", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 teaspoons piment\u00f3n", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 swordfish or other fish steaks, about 1 1/2 pounds", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "Lemon juice to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start a grill or preheat broiler.
