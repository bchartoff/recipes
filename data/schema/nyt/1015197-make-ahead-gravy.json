{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Make-Ahead Gravy", "description": "You need gravy on Thanksgiving to lubricate the turkey, moisten the potatoes, douse the stuffing. But traditionally it's made at the last minute, after the turkey has been removed from the roasting pan. Here\u2019s a secret: There's no need to make gravy right before serving. You can make it up to five days ahead. Then, as you reheat it, whisk in the turkey pan drippings for extra flavor. The result is every bit as good as last-minute gravy \u2014 and far less crazy-making.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/08/dining/08makeaheadgravy/08makeaheadgravy-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "5 to 6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1001}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 184, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "389 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 stick butter", "1/2 cup chopped onion", "1/2 cup flour", "Salt and pepper", "4 to 5 cups rich stock, warmed", "Turkey drippings and giblets (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, then add onions.
