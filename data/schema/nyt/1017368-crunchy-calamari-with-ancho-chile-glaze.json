{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy Calamari With Ancho Chile Glaze", "description": "My introduction to manzanilla decades ago was alongside a plate of fried prawns at El Faro in C\u00e1diz, near Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, in southern Spain. Nothing could provide a better partner for the sweet, briny shrimp than the pale, intensely floral, somewhat saline wine. Yet after our tasting of deliciously intense manzanillas, I was determined to show how well the wine could pair alongside food that was not Spanish: with dim sum, for example, or fried Ipswich clams. That was until I tasted Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s crunchy calamari at the Matador Room, his restaurant in Miami Beach. Delicately crisp, impossibly tender and fueled with a piquant glaze, they were perfection with a glass of manzanilla. Back at home with his recipe, plenty of oil, the hottest possible temperature and a messy stove got me close.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/29/dining/29PAIR/29PAIR-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "ancho chile, calamari, chipotle powder, club soda, red wine, appetizer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 444, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "907 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup sugar", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 teaspoon crushed ancho chile", "1/4 teaspoon chipotle powder", "2 cups dry red wine", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar", "Salt", "1 pound cleaned calamari, the smaller the better", "1 cup flour", "12 ounces club soda", "Vegetable oil for deep-frying", "1 lime, zested, then cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Moisten sugar with 1 tablespoon water in a shallow saucepan.
