{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seaweed Salad With Scallops", "description": "Sweet and briny scallops need little more than a splash of oil and a pinch of seasoning to be delicious. Because they\u2019re often enjoyed raw, it\u2019s important to purchase fresh, high-quality bivalves. Many store-bought scallops are soaked in a phosphate solution that plumps them up with water (therefore bumping up the price), so it\u2019s important to look for scallops that are labeled \u201cdry\u201d or \u201cdry-packed.\u201d A waterlogged scallop doesn\u2019t sear well, and a phosphate-marinated scallop may taste like soap, especially when consumed raw as they are here. In this 10-minute recipe, the scallop takes center-stage while seaweed and cucumber provide texture, and soy sauce and sesame oil add depth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/09/dining/Seaweed-Salad-With-Scallops/Seaweed-Salad-With-Scallops-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 appetizer servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings, seafood, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, cucumber, scallops, seaweed, sesame oil, fall, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 10}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce dried seaweed (a mixture is best)", "8 large scallops", "1/2 cup chopped cucumber", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons dark sesame oil", "Salt and pepper", "Sliced scallions and sesame seeds, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the seaweed then soak it in a large pot of water until tender, about 5 minutes.
