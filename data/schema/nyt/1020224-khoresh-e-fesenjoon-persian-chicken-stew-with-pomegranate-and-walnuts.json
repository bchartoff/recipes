{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Khoresh-e Fesenjoon (Persian Chicken Stew With Pomegranate and Walnuts)", "description": "Fesenjoon hails from the verdant northern Iranian hills and coast, where pomegranate and walnut trees grow. Taking its flavor cues from the land, this stew braises bone-in chicken thighs in a blend of toasted walnuts, pomegranate juice and pomegranate molasses. As the sauce cooks, it thickens and deepens to a shade of dark brown similar to that of mole poblano. You\u2019ll need to thin it out with water to prevent it from becoming overly sticky and syrupy. The sweet and sour flavors of the pomegranate, along with the silky texture the walnuts bring to the stew, make it one of the most elegant dishes in Persian cuisine.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/14Iranianrex7/merlin_154113903_ae20974a-5c45-4c79-b7c3-0ef8a615fc47-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "poultry, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken thighs, pomegranate juice, pomegranate molasses, pomegranate seeds, saffron, turmeric, walnut, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 228}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound walnut pieces (about 4 cups)", "6 to 8 bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 1/4 pounds)", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 yellow onion, thinly sliced", "4 cups cold-pressed pomegranate juice", "1/4 cup good-quality pomegranate molasses, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads", "1 to 2 teaspoons granulated sugar (optional)", "Pomegranate seeds, for garnish", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020207\">Polo Ba Tahdig</a> (Persian Rice With Bread Crust), for serving", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020213\">Mast-o Khiar</a> or plain yogurt, for serving", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020212\">Salad-e Shirazi</a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
