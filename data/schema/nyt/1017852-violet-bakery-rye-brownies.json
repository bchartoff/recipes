{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Violet Bakery Rye Brownies", "description": "You wouldn\u2019t necessarily think adding rye flour to brownies would be a good idea, but it\u2019s fabulous. The flour lends a deep earthiness that works wonderfully with the bittersweet depth of the chocolate. A sprinkle of flaky sea salt on top makes it taste even more chocolaty. These brownies are extremely moist, so don\u2019t overbake them; they should still be a bit wobbly in the center when you pull them from the oven. They\u2019ll solidify as they cool.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/02/dining/02COOKBOOKS2/02COOKBOOKS2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 brownies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, rye flour, sea salt, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 408}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 435, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "64 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "256 milligrams", "sugarContent": "47 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["11 tablespoons/156 grams unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, more for greasing pan", "10 1/2 ounces/300 grams\u00a0bittersweet chocolate (60 to 70 percent cocoa), chopped", "1 1/2 cups/200 grams whole grain rye flour", "1/2 cup/50 grams unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon/3 grams baking powder", "1 teaspoon/5 grams fine sea salt", "4 large eggs", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/200 grams light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon/15 milliliters vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon/5 grams flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for sprinkling on top"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
