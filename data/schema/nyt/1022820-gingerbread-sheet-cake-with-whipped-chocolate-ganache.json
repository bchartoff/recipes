{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gingerbread Sheet Cake With Whipped Chocolate Ganache", "description": "The gentle bite of fresh ginger and spices pairs wonderfully with bittersweet chocolate. Sticky molasses and spicy ginger flavor this warm and cozy one-bowl cake, which tastes wonderful on its own, but is even better when topped with a fluffy whipped chocolate ganache. Make sure to use chopped bars of chocolate here rather than chips, which contain stabilizers that will make the ganache grainy. The ganache will look and feel a lot like whipped cream when you spread it on the cake, but will solidify to a more mousse-like consistency when it cools.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/10/dining/ya-gingerbread-sheet-cake-with-whipped-chocolate-ganache/ya-gingerbread-sheet-cake-with-whipped-chocolate-ganache-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "buttermilk, chocolate, ginger, molasses, one bowl, christmas, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 304}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs", "1 cup/240 grams buttermilk", "3/4 cup/255 grams unsulfured molasses", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "1/2 cup/100 grams grapeseed or other neutral flavored oil", "2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger", "2 tablespoons ground ginger", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "8 ounces/225 grams bittersweet chocolate bar (65 to 70 percent) chopped,", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "1 cup/225 grams heavy cream", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "Pinch of kosher salt", "Chopped crystallized ginger, for decorating (optional)", "Shaved chocolate, for decorating (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees.
