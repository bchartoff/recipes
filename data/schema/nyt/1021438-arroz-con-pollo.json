{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arroz con Pollo", "description": "Ubiquitous throughout Latin America and beyond, this dish can be as simple or as complex as your ingredients allow. The key is to layer flavor, adding dimension as you go. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are preferred, but bone-in will also work well. (Chicken breasts lack the same amount of fat and flavor, so they are not recommended here.) Watch the rice carefully as it cooks, absorbing the liquid, as pots and stoves vary greatly. If it starts to smell a little burned, reduce the heat, toss and put the lid on the pot. But don\u2019t worry, as this aroma can be part of creating the coveted pegao, a layer of toasted rice that develops on the bottom of the pan and sticks to it, similar to Persian tahdig, Spanish socarrat or Senegalese xoon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/dining/26resiliencerex2/merlin_177593448_e98ec7ca-732b-45b3-a840-e9d22fa37a6c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "latin american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, cilantro, frozen peas, puerto rican, rice, tomato sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1560}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large garlic cloves, finely minced", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 teaspoons white vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "3 cups medium-grain white rice", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "5 cups low-sodium chicken broth (or water)", "2 1/2 to 3 cups fresh sofrito (see recipe below)", "3 dried bay leaves", "1 teaspoon ground annatto or sweet paprika", "1 cup tomato sauce (basic canned tomato sauce is fine)", "3/4 cup medium pimento-stuffed olives, drained (optional)", "2 teaspoons drained capers (optional)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper", "2 cups frozen peas, thawed", "1 lime, cut into wedges", "Salted, sliced avocado and tomato, for serving", "1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and cut into quarters", "3 aj\u00ed dulce or amarillo peppers (or mini bell peppers), seeded and coarsely chopped", "6 large garlic cloves", "1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped", "6 fresh culantro leaves and tender stems, coarsely chopped (see Note)", "6 fresh cilantro stems, coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the adobo by whisking the ingredients together in a bowl, or blending in a small food processor, pil\u00f3n or mortar and pestle."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat the chicken dry, then place in a large bowl or zip-top bag.
