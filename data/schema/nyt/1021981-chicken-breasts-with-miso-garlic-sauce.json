{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Breasts With Miso-Garlic Sauce", "description": "Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are known for becoming dry, but brining them before cooking helps retain moisture. The chicken is soaked in cold, salted water to which a small amount of whey or yogurt is added. (The lactic acid and phosphates in the dairy help with moisture retention.) However, the star of this recipe isn\u2019t the chicken: It\u2019s the sauce, made from miso, plenty of garlic and a good amount of lemon and leftover pan juices. Just take care when salting it: Miso is salty by nature, and lemon juice tends to heighten its brininess. Round out the meal by pairing it with white rice, or a vibrant salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/11/dining/ns-chicken-miso/merlin_184703406_ac39c68d-be77-4745-a319-b6a7cafbc3c1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry, main course", "keywords": "butter, chicken breast, garlic, lemon, miso, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1140}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons plain whole-milk yogurt or whey", "4 cups cold water", "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 pounds)", "1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted, or olive oil", "2 tablespoons onion powder", "1 tablespoon garlic powder", "2 teaspoons chipotle powder", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick), cubed", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "1 tablespoon lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1 tablespoon red miso", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "2 tablespoons minced scallions or chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
