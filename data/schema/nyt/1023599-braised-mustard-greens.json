{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Mustard Greens", "description": "Mustard greens are a delectable option for the simplest weeknight meal or the grandest holiday table. Though they\u2019re from the same plant family as collard greens, mustard greens are more peppery and the cooked leaves are more tender. (They also cook down a lot more, so it takes a lot of mustard greens to make a decent serving amount!) This recipe is generous with the liquid, because as it cooks it becomes something just as delicious as the greens themselves: pot likker. Smoked meats are often used for their flavor, but a small amount of liquid smoke keeps this recipe meat-free. Be sure to serve your greens in a bowl, so you can slurp up the resulting pot likker afterward.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/26/dining/vl-mustard-greens/vl-mustard-greens-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "broth, mustard greens, one pot, healthy, vegan, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 28}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound mustard greens (2 to 3 bunches)", "2 tablespoons olive oil\u00a0", "1 large onion, finely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "2 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock\u00a0", "Salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon hot sauce (such as Tabasco) or apple cider vinegar\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Thoroughly wash the mustard greens: Rinse each leaf well, and then submerge under water in a large bowl or clean sink.
