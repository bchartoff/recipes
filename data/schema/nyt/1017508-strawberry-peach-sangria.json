{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry-Peach Sangria", "description": "Part sangria, part punch, this is a refreshing and lightly alcoholic way to quench the thirst of a large group. Danielle Wecksler, a cooking instructor in South Carolina, created it for an outdoor Lowcountry boil in Charleston. It highlights local peaches and berries, and was created to counter the stifling Southern heat. \u201cPart of the rationale is that when it is so hot, partygoers are going to suck down whatever you give them to drink,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you go with something that is a little lighter on the alcohol content, it keeps everyone from getting too tipsy.\u201d This recipe easily doubles to serve a crowd. If you can\u2019t find orange Cura\u00e7ao, use a Cura\u00e7ao-style liqueur, such as Grand Marnier. Triple sec, another type of orange liqueur, is slightly less sweet but would also work.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/01/dining/01SANGRIA/01SANGRIA-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "About 10 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "punches", "keywords": "blackberry, blueberry, cura\u00e7ao, peach, strawberry, white wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 172}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 265, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "21 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound strawberries, hulled", "6 sprigs fresh mint", "3 firm, ripe peaches, sliced", "1 large orange, halved and thinly sliced", "1/2 pint blueberries", "1/2 pint blackberries", "1 bottle dry light white wine, such as Vinho Verde, chilled", "1/2 cup orange Cura\u00e7ao or other orange-flavored liqueur", "1/2 cup lemonade, chilled", "2 cups orange-flavored sparkling water, chilled"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Freeze the strawberries in a zipper-lock bag at least 1 day in advance of making the sangria."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use a 12-cup muffin pan to make large ice cubes.
