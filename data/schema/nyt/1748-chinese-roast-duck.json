I've tried, believe me, and it is about as far from the minimalist ideal as making vegetable p\u00e2t\u00e9.\n\nThe good news is that very similar results can be achieved, in less than an hour, if you cut up the duck. With a just a modicum of attention, the duck will gain a glorious, mahogany color that will belie the amount of work you spent on it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "duck, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 35}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 duck, 4 to 5 pounds", "Salt and pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons Shao Xing rice wine or dry sherry", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "1/2 cup brown sugar", "1 cinnamon stick, about 3 inches long", "5 or 6 nickle-size slices ginger", "4 pieces whole star anise", "2 cloves", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut duck as you would a chicken, into 6 or 8 serving pieces; discard wing tips, back and neck, or reserve to make stock. Place duck, skin side down, in a 12-inch skillet over high heat and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. When duck begins to sizzle, cover skillet and turn heat to medium. After 15 minutes, turn duck and season skin side. After 15 more minutes, uncover skillet and turn heat to medium-high. Cook duck, turning as necessary, so that it browns nicely on both sides; this will take another 15 minutes or so."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove duck to a plate and pour off all but a tablespoon of fat; leave any solids in pan.
