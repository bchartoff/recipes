{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Brown-Butter Orzo With Butternut Squash", "description": "In this autumnal one-pot meal, rice-shaped orzo is cooked with stock and butternut squash until it\u2019s tender and creamy, a little like risotto but without as much stirring. Brown butter, lemon zest and sage add depth of flavor, while red-pepper flakes give this zip and heat. An optional dollop of ricotta intensifies the creaminess but feel free to skip it for a lighter dish. This recipe also works well as a hearty side for roasted meats and fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/03/dining/03apperex-1/merlin_198117099_fddcf9be-120f-40b6-8ed5-c9969d74e768-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, one pot, pastas, main course, side dish", "keywords": "brown butter, butternut squash, orzo, sage, fall, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2670}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "3/4 cup thinly sliced shallots (2 to 3), or use onion or leek", "1 small (2-pound) butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 3/4-inch cubes (3 cups)", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage leaves, or 2 teaspoons chopped rosemary or marjoram, plus more for serving if you like", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for serving", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "3 cups vegetable stock or chicken stock", "1 1/2 cup uncooked orzo", "1 lemon, zested and halved", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "1/2 cup whole-milk ricotta (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium Dutch oven, or a large (12-inch) skillet,\u00a0melt butter over medium heat.
