Here, pork chops are seared until they're mahogany in color, then tossed in with a quick sauce of tomatoes, garlic, rosemary and anchovies. The whole mess goes in to the oven for about 15 minutes until the chops are cooked through. Don't be put off by the anchovies; they will magically melt into the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/17/dining/-Braised-Pork-Chops/-Braised-Pork-Chops-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, one pot", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course, pork chops, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 627}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 501, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1233 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1 1/2-inch-thick bone-in pork loin chops (about 1 1/2 pounds total)", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more for seasoning pork", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more for seasoning pork", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced", "3 large rosemary sprigs", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 pounds plum tomatoes (preferably a mix of red and yellow), roughly chopped", "6 anchovy fillets", "Polenta, noodles or rice, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
