{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Polenta With Goat Cheese and Rosemary", "description": "Sam Sifton brought this recipe, from the chef Matthew Kenney, to The Times in 2009. Mr. Kenney had great success in the 1990s with a string of restaurants, and this dish became a dinner party favorite, of sorts, for Brooklynites of a certain time. The ingredients are few, and the technique simple. So do as Sifton suggests: \u201cGet good organic apples that can hold up to heat and the best coarse-ground polenta and thick, creamy goat cheese you can find. Spend the money for Grade A maple syrup and organic pecans. And spend the time to find the candied ginger, which adds a bright, floral taste to the final dish.\u201d Serve it with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012776-restaurant-style-pork-chops\">these pork chops</a>, another of Mr. Kenney\u2019s dishes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/20/dining/Polenta-With-Goat-Cheese/Polenta-With-Goat-Cheese-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "gluten-free, goat cheese, polenta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 71}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 391, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "51 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "759 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade, plus more as needed", "2 cups polenta", "6 ounces soft goat cheese, crumbled", "1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary", "2 tablespoons butter", "Kosher salt", "freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring the stock to a boil in a large, heavy saucepan over high heat.
