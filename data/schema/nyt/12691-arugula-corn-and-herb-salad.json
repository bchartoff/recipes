{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Arugula, Corn and Herb Salad", "description": "Corn, lightly steamed and cut off the cob, is terrific in salads. It goes very nicely with arugula, the sweet corn providing a beautiful contrast to the pungent salad green. Although we don\u2019t think of corn as a nutritional powerhouse, it\u2019s a good source of several nutrients, including thiamin (vitamin B1), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), folate, dietary fiber, vitamin C, phosphorus and manganese. A cup of corn supplies 19 percent of the recommended daily dose of folate, and about a quarter of the daily value for thiamin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/21/science/20recipehealth/20recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "healthy, vegetarian, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 77}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 142, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "265 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large ear of corn", "6 ounces baby arugula, washed and spun dry", "2 tablespoons chopped or slivered fresh herbs, like basil, tarragon, chives, parsley, marjoram", "1 ounce shaved Parmesan", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1 small garlic clove, pur\u00e9ed (optional)", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 medium-size ripe tomatoes, cut in wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam the corn until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
