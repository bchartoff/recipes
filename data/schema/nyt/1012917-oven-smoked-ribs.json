I started with a dry rub; it\u2019s the same one I use every summer, based on a recipe my friend Chris Schlesinger shared with me years ago.\n\nThen I used a roasting pan and aluminum foil to cobble together a smoker. It\u2019s a rudimentary approach, but one that creates a smoky steam that in turn infuses the meat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/01/dining/oven-smoked-ribs/oven-smoked-ribs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course, spare ribs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 167}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 627, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "51 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "523 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon salt", "2 tablespoons brown sugar", "1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon ground cumin", "1 tablespoon chili powder", "2 tablespoons paprika", "1 rack spareribs, 2 to 3 pounds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 225 degrees.
