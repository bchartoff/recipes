{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black-Eyed Peas With Vegetables and Small Pasta", "description": "The range of bean and vegetable main dishes in the Greek repertory is striking; every region has its specialties. Many of the traditional dishes are called \u201colive oil dishes\u201d (or ladera), because they are cooked with copious amounts of extra virgin olive oil. I tone down the amounts in my kitchen. But I still use enough to ensure that the broth accompanying vegetables or beans is alchemized to a velvety sauce, often enhanced with a splash of fresh lemon juice or vinegar just before serving. Since black-eyed peas require no soaking, you can cook this after work so long as you have some vegetables around the house. It is an utterly simple dish that I\u2019ve adapted from a recipe in Ms. Kochilas\u2019s cookbook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/02/22/health/22recipehealth_600/22recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "Serves four", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "healthy, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 37}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 300, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "163 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound dried black-eyed peas, picked over and rinsed", "1 large onion, finely chopped", "2 large carrots, finely chopped", "1 large red bell pepper, seeded and chopped", "1/4 cup tomato paste dissolved in 1/2 cup water", "2 to 4 garlic cloves to taste, minced", "1 bay leaf", "1 dried hot pepper, or 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon hot pepper flakes", "1/4 to 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup small pasta, such as elbow macaroni or tubettini, or small square Greek egg noodles", "1/2 to 1 cup chopped cooked spinach or greens (optional)", "1 to 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cover the black-eyed peas with water, bring to a boil and then drain."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the drained black-eyed peas, onion, carrots, red bell pepper, dissolved tomato paste, garlic, bay leaf, hot pepper and 1/4 cup olive oil in a large soup pot or Dutch oven.
