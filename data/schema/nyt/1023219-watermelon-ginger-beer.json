(They can be hard to find; seedless melons work too.) If you own a juicer, proceed with the seeds and all and don\u2019t worry about straining. Watermelon is over 90 percent water and is a nutrient-dense food. This drink can serve as an everyday accompaniment at breakfast, lunch, dinner or with a snack.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nicole Taylor"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/08/dining/06JuneteenthREX1-Watermelon-Ginger-Beer/merlin_207641871_210a41e8-f761-4101-9b5c-cb368a73c48b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 drinks", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "ginger beer, watermelon, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 119}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons fresh fennel fronds (optional)\u00a0", "Filtered water", "6 cups (1-inch) cubed red watermelon (from about 3 pounds watermelon)", "2 cups ginger beer, homemade or store-bought (see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Divide the fennel fronds, if using, between two ice cube trays.
