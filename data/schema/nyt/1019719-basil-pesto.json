{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basil Pesto", "description": "Though pesto means \u201cpounded\u201d in Italian, the rush of modern life has taken the recipe out of the mortar and into the blender (or food processor) for most of us. This version, adapted from a Ligurian woman, Lidia Caveri, gently encourages (but does not require) a return to the mortar. The constant rap of the pestle will jostle the nuts, basil and garlic into an emulsified base. Add the oil and cheese to get an impossibly thick, creamy sauce that clings to pasta unlike any machine-made counterpart could. Though you might think otherwise, the pesto will come together before the pasta water has a chance to boil. And as a bonus, there'll be no blender to wash up afterward.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/11/magazine/11mag-eat-slide-S92W/11mag-eat-slide-S92W-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 1 cup sauce, which is perfect for a pound of pasta", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, pastas, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "basil, parmigiano-reggiano, pecorino, pine nuts", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 251}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup (30 grams) pine nuts", "1 medium clove garlic, peeled", "2 cups (70 grams) tightly packed basil leaves, preferably Genovese", "2/3 cup (60 grams) finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving", "1/3 cup (30 grams) finely grated pecorino, preferably pecorino sardo", "Sea salt", "1/3 cup (80 milliliters) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 pound trofie\u00a0or spaghetti"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a large pot of water to boil over high heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use a mortar and pestle to pound and grind the pine nuts to a fine paste (no distinct pieces should be visible).
