{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Grain Macaroni and Cheese", "description": "This is a macaroni and cheese that's not too heavy and benefits mightily from the use of whole-wheat pasta and the addition of broccoli. You can assemble it ahead and bake it when you need it, or bake it ahead and reheat. There are a number of excellent whole wheat macaroni products on the market now. Check out Community Grains and MagNoodles. When you cook the macaroni, be sure to cook it for less time than usual so that it is more al dente; otherwise it will become too soft and may fall apart when you bake it in the final casserole.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/24/dining/24MARTHA/24MARTHA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, high fiber, kosher, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 583}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 388, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "586 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil, plus additional for oiling dish", "1/2 pound whole grain macaroni shells, elbows, penne, or fusilli", "1 large broccoli crown, broken into small florets (about 3/4 pound)", "2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot", "2 tablespoons flour, sifted", "3 cups milk (1 percent, 2 percent or whole, to taste)", "Salt and white or black pepper", "Pinch of nutmeg", "4 ounces Gruy\u00e8re, grated (1 cup tightly packed)", "1 ounce freshly grated Parmesan (1/4 cup tightly packed)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
