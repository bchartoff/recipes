{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Scotcheroos", "description": "Originally printed on the Rice Krispies box in the 1960s, Scotcheroos are Rice Krispies treats minus the marshmallow but with gobs of peanut butter, chocolate and butterscotch chips. Use either natural, unsweetened peanut butter or the more conventional stuff. Either will work just fine, with the natural version tasting a tad less sweet. For a twist, you could also swap the corn syrup for honey, golden syrup or a mix of both. Bittersweet chocolate, as opposed to semisweet, helps to balance the sweetness. A sprinkling of flaky salt and crushed peanuts aren\u2019t traditional, but they look as good as they taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/26/dining/ss-scotcheroos/merlin_195941721_957dd56e-1a04-4d68-bff6-8b2d8d69612f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "24 bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bar cookie, bittersweet chocolate, corn syrup, peanut butter, rice krispies", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 605}, "recipeIngredient": ["Cooking spray", "8 cups (200 grams) puffed rice cereal", "1 1/2 cups peanut butter, well-mixed natural or conventional (see Tip)", "1 cup (201 grams) granulated sugar", "1 cup light corn syrup", "2 tablespoons butter, salted or unsalted", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Kosher salt", "1 1/4 cups (215 grams) chopped bittersweet chocolate or chocolate chips", "1 cup (166 grams) butterscotch chips", "Flaky salt and crushed peanuts, for sprinkling (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a 13-by-9-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides.
