{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tempe Penyet (Smashed Tempeh With Sambal)", "description": "Tempe penyet is a famous street food in Indonesia, especially common on the island of Java, where tempeh originated. \u201cPenyet\u201d means \u201cto smash\u201d or \u201cto flatten\u201d in Indonesian, and the technique ensures that every crack and crevice of this fried tempeh is penetrated by the sambal it is smashed upon. This version pan-fries the tempeh for ease, rather than deep-frying it, as is traditional. (If you prefer deep-frying, fry for 5 to 6 minutes in 350-degree oil until golden.) Caramelize the shallot, tomato and chile sambal until it browns and slightly chars, adding wonderful flavor and chewy-crispy bits. A drizzle of kecap manis, an Indonesian sweet soy sauce infused with spices, balances the dish with a savory-sweetness.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a> newsletter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lara Lee"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/20/dining/ll-tempe-penyet/merlin_190839744_aa514d2d-d48c-4d57-8016-3d95b48e1323-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indonesian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "tempeh, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 484}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "2 teaspoons ground coriander", "1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea salt", "16 ounces/455 grams tempeh, cut into \u00bc-inch-by-2\u00bd-inch slices", "1/4 cup canola oil, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup canola oil", "4 medium tomatoes, halved and thinly sliced", "7 medium shallots, peeled and sliced", "10 long, red, medium-spicy chiles (such as serrano, red finger or cayenne), deseeded and sliced", "7 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice (preferably from makrut lime, calamansi or Key lime), plus lime wedges for serving", "1 to 2 tablespoons kecap manis (see Tip)", "Steamed jasmine rice", "1/2 medium English cucumber, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate the tempeh: In a large bowl or resealable freezer bag, combine the garlic, coriander and 1 teaspoon salt with \u00be cup plus 2 tablespoons water.
