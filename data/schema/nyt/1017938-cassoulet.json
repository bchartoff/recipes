Sometimes what you want in the kitchen is a project, a culinary jigsaw puzzle to solve. There is no greater one than cassoulet. I developed the recipe that follows at the shoulder of Phillipe Bertineau, the chef at Alain Ducasse\u2019s Benoit bistro in New York City: rich and creamy, sticky with duck and pork, brightly spiced, with an astonishing depth of flavor. Feel free to tweak the list of ingredients to match what you can find in the market, but if you can manage the Tarbais beans and the duck fat for the confit, you really won\u2019t be sorry. Start the preparation on the evening before you have a day off. A few hours of cooking the next day yields a dinner of remarkable heft and deliciousness, one that pairs well with red wine and good friends.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/24/magazine/24eat/24mag-24eat-t_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles", "keywords": "duck fat, duck leg, french four-spice powder, pork hocks, pork sausage, salt pork, Tarbais beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 310}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups Tarbais beans, approximately 3/4 pound, or substitute Great Northern beans or other large white beans, picked over to remove stones", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "3 unsmoked pork hocks, sometimes sold as \u2018\u2018knuckles\u2019\u2019", "1 pound salted pork belly, sometimes sold as \u2018\u2018salt pork,\u2019\u2019 skin removed and reserved, sliced into 6 portions", "2 pig ears (optional)", "3 duck legs", "1 teaspoon French four-spice powder, or substitute 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper and a healthy pinch each of ground cloves, ground ginger and ground nutmeg", "1 pinch ground cardamom", "1 pinch ground coriander", "1 pinch ground nutmeg", "1 pinch sweet paprika", "1 pinch cayenne pepper", "2 tablespoons kosher salt", "1 tablespoon ground white pepper", "1 quart duck fat or as much as you can find, plus 1-2 pounds best available lard", "3 whole heads of garlic", "2 bay leaves", "1 sprig thyme", "1 sprig rosemary", "4 pods star anise", "1 bouquet garni (1 celery rib, 1/2 peeled carrot, 1/2 medium-size peeled onion, 1/2 head garlic, 6-8 sprigs of parsley, either wrapped together with butcher\u2019s twine or put in a cheesecloth sachet)", "6 fresh pork garlic sausages", "3 small carrots, trimmed, peeled and diced, approximately 2 cups", "2 ribs celery, trimmed, peeled and diced, approximately 2 cups", "1 small celery root, trimmed, peeled and diced, approximately 2 cups", "1 medium-size turnip, trimmed, peeled and diced, approximately 2 cups", "1 small rutabaga, trimmed, peeled and diced, approximately 2 cups", "2 tablespoons tomato paste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Day 1:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put beans in a large bowl, and cover with cold water, then add baking soda, and allow to soak overnight."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the pork hocks, sliced pork belly, reserved pork skin and, if using, the pig ears into a stockpot, and fill with water to cover them by several inches, then set over high heat to come to a boil.
