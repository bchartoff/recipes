Beef stroganoff makes for an outstanding dinner: a vat of tender saut\u00e9ed meat in a silken gravy studded with caramelized mushrooms, alongside a huge tangle of buttered noodles. Be careful when adding the cream at the end: Sour cream easily curdles in the heat, while cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or heavy cream offer smoother results.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/16/magazine/16mag-eat/16mag-eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, noodles", "keywords": "beef, beef tenderloin, button mushrooms, egg noodles, parsley, worcestershire sauce, fall, winter, main course, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 770}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds sirloin roast, or beef tenderloin, if you\u2019re feeling fancy", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons hot paprika", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 pound button mushrooms, cleaned and cut into quarters", "2 small shallots, thinly sliced", "12 ounces wide egg noodles", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "1 cup heavy cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the beef against the grain into 1/2-inch slices, pound lightly, then cut those slices into 1-inch-wide strips."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the flour, paprika, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper to a large shallow bowl and toss to combine.
