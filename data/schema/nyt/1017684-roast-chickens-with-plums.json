{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Chickens With Plums", "description": "This recipe, which roasts two chickens at the same time, has been engineered to feed a crowd. It's no harder than roasting one chicken. The birds get rubbed down with a garlicky sumac spice rub brightened with lemon zest. Then, as they cook, their fragrant drippings season sliced plums roasting in the pan underneath them, which caramelize into a fruity, chutney-like sauce. Feel free to halve the recipe if you\u2019d rather, but be sure to reduce the oven temperature to 425 degrees. For two chickens you need the higher heat so they both crisp properly, but for only one chicken, slightly lower heat keeps the plums from burning.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/01/multimedia/clark-chicken-plums/clark-chicken-plums-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, honey, plum, sumac, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 510}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 713, "unsaturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "1057 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large lemons", "2 tablespoons ground sumac", "4 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 tablespoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon cinnamon", "1 teaspoon allspice", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 garlic cloves, grated or minced", "2 chickens, 4 to 4 1/2 pounds each", "1 bunch thyme, more for garnish", "2 1/4 pounds plums, halved or quartered if large", "4 shallots, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rounds", "2 tablespoons honey", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon allspice", "1 bay leaf, torn in half"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grate the zest from the lemons and place in a small bowl.
