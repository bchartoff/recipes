Fresh lemon juice and ghooreh, or unripe grapes, lighten the stew and lend a particularly tart punch. (Use fresh or frozen ghooreh if you can find either. You could also use pickled ghooreh, but be sure to rinse them well before using to rid them of excess salt.) Those sharp flavors contrast nicely with the soft, comforting texture of the eggplant and tomatoes, which grow silky as they cook down. This dish is particularly delicious with a piece of crunchy tahdig.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/14Iranianrex6/merlin_154114563_510d1c7c-f8d0-4f6f-9bf9-c0756e7619c9-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, soups and stews", "keywords": "japanese eggplant, lamb shoulder, rice, saffron, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 162}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound boneless lamb shoulder, trimmed and cut into 2-inch cubes", "1 heaping teaspoon ground turmeric", "Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper", "6 to 8 Japanese eggplants (about 2 pounds)", "5 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup olive oil", "1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced", "4 small or 2 medium tomatoes (about 2 pounds)", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "1/4 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads", "1/4 to 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (from 2 to 4 limes)", "1/3 cup fresh or frozen unripe grapes (ghooreh)", "Polo Ba Tahdig (Persian Rice With Bread Crust), for serving (see <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020207\">recipe</a>)", "Mast-o Khiar (see <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020213\">recipe</a>) or plain yogurt, for serving", "Persian liteh or garlic pickles, for serving (optional)", "Assorted fresh herbs (such as mint, tarragon and basil), scallions and radishes, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, season lamb with turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
