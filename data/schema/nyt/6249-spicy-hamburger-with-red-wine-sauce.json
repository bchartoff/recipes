{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Hamburger With Red-Wine Sauce", "description": "Mr. Franey gives this American classic a Gallic twist. The recipe here can be prepared on a barbecue grill, in an oven broiler or even in a skillet. Whether you barbecue or broil, cook the patties about six inches from the heat source for about three minutes on each side, or until done as desired. If you are cooking on the stove top, use a heavy-gauge cast iron skillet. Cast iron sears extremely well when hot, but it has to be smoking hot before the meat is put in. Be sure the ventilation fan is on.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, burgers, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "beef, chicken broth, chili powder, dry red wine, ground chuck, onion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 6}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 378, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "641 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds ground lean chuck", "2 teaspoons vegetable oil", "1 cup finely chopped onions", "2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic", "2 tablespoons chili con carne seasoning", "1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper", "1/8 teaspoon red hot-pepper flakes", "Salt to taste", "3 tablespoons butter", "2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots", "1/2 cup dry red wine", "1/4 cup beef or chicken broth"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the meat in a mixing bowl and set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a small skillet and add the onions.
