{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggs With Gigante Beans and Harissa", "description": "A combination of soft beans, harissa-imbued vegetables, crisp-edged fried eggs and salty bits of cured tuna (or prosciutto), this unusual brunch dish is substantial and interesting enough to serve for dinner. While the chef Ignacio Mattos of Estela restaurant in New York City designed the dish around the plump gigante beans, any white bean, canned or freshly cooked, will work just as well. You can make the the beans and harissa mixture a few days ahead. But don't start toasting the bread until the last minute. You need it as crisp as possible to contrast with all the other soft textures.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/28/dining/28BRUNCH1/28BRUNCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "beans, eggs, harissa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 901, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "115 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "27 grams", "proteinContent": "61 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1175 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 teaspoon whole cumin seed", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 medium onion, sliced", "1/2 green bell pepper, sliced", "2/3 cup harissa sauce or spread", "1 cup whole canned tomatoes with juices", "1 teaspoon red wine vinegar", "1 teaspoon sugar", "Kosher salt, as needed", "3 cups cooked or canned gigante beans, or other white beans, liquid reserved", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 large eggs", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "4 slices crusty bread, toasted", "1 small bunch cilantro", "Lemon juice, as needed", "1 (4-ounce) piece mojama (salt-cured tuna) or  or 4 ounces sliced prosciutto"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a large, dry skillet over medium heat, toast the cumin seeds until fragrant.
