{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Mushrooms With Chive Butter", "description": "Throwing whole mushroom caps onto the grill is a standard and effortless approach, but, because of their concave shape, they often steam rather than sear on one side, which does nothing to concentrate their meaty flavor. Instead, try slicing mushrooms into thick, hearty wedges and threading them onto skewers, flat sides facing out, and you\u2019ll be able to sear them successfully.\u00a0This recipe calls for seasoning the mushrooms with a paprika rub, grilling, then topping with a lemony herbed butter that offsets their smoky char. Serve them as a side, or as a vegetarian main with virtually anything: green salads, couscous salads, grilled vegetables or, for heartier appetites, potatoes of all stripes like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021682-pure-potato-latkes\">latkes</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018298-french-fries\">French fries</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019882-twice-baked-potatoes\">baked potatoes</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/01/dining/aw-grilled-portobello/merlin_193269171_bbcdde27-8c9f-4fa6-a1e5-8c2237903080-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, main course", "keywords": "butter, paprika, portobello, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 84}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and softened at room temperature", "3 tablespoons minced fresh chives", "1 small garlic clove, finely grated (using a Microplane)", "1 packed teaspoon fresh lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon ground oregano", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika", "5 to 6 fresh, firm, large portobello mushroom caps (about 18 to 20 ounces)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the herbed butter: In a medium bowl, combine the butter, chives, garlic, lemon zest, oregano, salt and pepper.
