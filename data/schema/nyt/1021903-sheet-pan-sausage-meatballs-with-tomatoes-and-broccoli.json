{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Sausage Meatballs With Tomatoes and Broccoli", "description": "Instead of making meatballs from scratch, this weeknight recipe calls for rolling bulk sausage into small meatballs that cook alongside broccoli, tomatoes and mushrooms. Sprinkling a layer of Parmesan over the entire pan during the second half of cooking allows it to melt and crisp simultaneously; a blanket of gooey cheese coats the roasted tomatoes, while the Parmesan that falls directly onto the sheet pan becomes crunchy and frico-like. Use the garlic bread that cooks alongside to scrape up any pan juices or to assemble French bread pizzas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/11/dining/yf-sheet-pan-sausage-meatballs/merlin_182183523_510c99e1-9dd4-49e9-9292-8ba8e04d7672-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, sausages, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "bread, broccoli, mushroom, sausage, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1179}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pint grape or cherry tomatoes, halved", "1 head broccoli florets or 2 bunches broccolini, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 4 cups)", "1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced (about 3 cups)", "1/4 cup olive oil, plus more as needed", "1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt", "3/4 pound bulk spicy or sweet Italian sausage (or fresh sausages removed from casing)", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "1 loaf soft Italian bread, split lengthwise", "3 to 5 small garlic cloves, grated or minced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees with one rack in the lower third and one in the upper.
