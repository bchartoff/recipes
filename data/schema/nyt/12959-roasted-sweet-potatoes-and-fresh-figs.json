{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Fresh Figs", "description": "This dish from Yotam Ottolenghi, a chef and an author of \"Jerusalem,\" the beloved Middle Eastern cookbook, takes inspiration from a city where fig trees grow in abundance. Roasted sweet potatoes, along with wedges of fresh figs, are piled onto a plate, drizzled with a green onion-chile sauce and a balsamic reduction then dotted with generous pats of goat cheese. Do plan ahead, as this recipe does require a bit of preparation, but it's easy work that's more than worth it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/12/health/wellveggie_jerusalem3/wellveggie_jerusalem3-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "fall, winter, fig, goat cheese, sweet potato, gluten-free, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 247}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 343, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "619 milligrams", "sugarContent": "26 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 small sweet potatoes (2 1/4 pounds total)", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "Scant 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (you can use a commercial rather than a premium aged grade)", "1 1/2 tablespoons superfine sugar", "12 green onions, halved lengthwise and cut into 1 1/2-inch segments", "1 red chili, thinly sliced", "6 ripe figs (8 1/2 ounces total), quartered", "5 ounces soft goat\u2019s milk cheese (optional)", "Maldon sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 475 degrees.
