{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Khoresh Rivas (Savory Rhubarb and Bean Stew)", "description": "In Iranian cuisine, rhubarb is often used in savory dishes rather than in sweet ones. The hearty pinkish-red stalks, which cook down quickly and tenderize, provide just the right amount of tang to herb-based stews like khoresh rivas. Typically, this bright and flavorful dish is prepared with red meat, but hearty butter beans star in this vegetarian version. Fresh herbs are used in impressively large amounts in this cuisine, often holding their own as main ingredients. Mint and parsley are a common combination for the base of many stews. Gently frying the herbs separately before adding them to the stew concentrates their flavors, adding layers of depth. This stew tastes even better the next day. Serve khoresh rivas with rice and a side of plain yogurt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/25/dining/nd-rhubarb-and-bean-stew/merlin_205954446_a6157d94-86a6-4841-a901-ba3d6b1a2311-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, beans, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "mint, rhubarb, spring, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 444}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon plus a pinch of granulated sugar, plus more to taste", "A pinch of saffron threads (about \u00be teaspoon)", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "3 large bunches parsley (about 12 ounces), tough stems trimmed, leaves and tender stems finely chopped (about 3 cups; see Tip)", "2 large bunches mint (about 5 ounces), stems trimmed, leaves finely chopped (about 2 cups; see Tip)", "1 large yellow onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "3 (15-ounce) cans butter beans or cannellini beans, rinsed and drained", "3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus more to taste", "2 to 3 large red rhubarb stalks (about 8 ounces), cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces", "Cooked rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a few tablespoons of water to a boil in a small pot.
