{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker White Chicken Chili", "description": "This tangy, mildly spicy white-bean chili is as warming and comforting as a traditional chili, but in a lighter, brighter form. Plenty of green chiles \u2014 fresh and canned \u2014 provide kick while creamy white beans mellow it all out. To decrease the heat level, remove and discard the seeds from the jalape\u00f1o before you mince it. A large handful of chopped cilantro added at the end brings freshness, but if you don\u2019t care for cilantro, pass it at the table along with the other toppings or omit it entirely. Continuing the spirit of customizing your chili, you can make this in the slow cooker or on the stovetop. Use 3 cups chicken stock in the slow cooker and 4 cups on the stovetop, where liquid is more likely to evaporate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/dining/sd-white-chicken-chili/sd-white-chicken-chili-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken, chiles, corn, jalape\u00f1o, white beans, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1867}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 370, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "935 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 large yellow or red onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt", "10 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 jalape\u00f1o, minced", "3 (4-ounce) cans chopped green chiles, hot, mild or a combination", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "2 teaspoons onion powder", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "3 cups chicken stock", "2 (14-ounce) cans great Northern beans, drained and rinsed", "1 1/2 cups frozen corn", "1 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro (about 1 small bunch), optional", "1 lime, juiced (about 2 tablespoons)", "Pickled jalape\u00f1o slices, sliced scallion, cubed avocado and sour cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.
