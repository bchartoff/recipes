As a corollary, something to do as the butter melts and you strain out the solids, boil off some potatoes, then let them dry in the refrigerator over night. Grate them in the morning, and cook in the clarified butter. When you've got a good crust going, place a plate over the pan, put your hand on it and quickly invert the whole. Then slide the new bottom, until recently the unfinished top, back into the pan to continue cooking. Serve with eggs, naturally.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/Henriettas-Hash-Browns/Henriettas-Hash-Browns-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast", "keywords": "gluten-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 91}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 229, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "370 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium Yukon Gold potatoes", "7 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Kosher salt", "freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the potatoes and place them in a large pot of cold water.
