{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meyer Lemon Tart", "description": "The Meyer lemon has always been something of a California secret, and every year when its brief growing season begins there, eager cooks sigh with relief. The Meyer is not as assertive as the common supermarket varieties, but it offers so much more in nuanced flavor that it is unforgettable. And these days, the Meyer's secret is finally out. A Meyer lemon contains about four times the sugar of a regular lemon, but it can be used almost interchangeably with the traditional varieties, adding a rounder edge to both sweet and savory dishes. And you can use the whole thing \u2013 from pulp to peel. This gorgeous tart is the ideal way to showcase its seductive fragrance and flavor. (Regular lemons will work well in this recipe too, but you'll likely want to add a bit more sugar.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/18/dining/18COOKING-LEMONTART1/18COOKING-LEMONTART1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 10-inch tart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, meyer lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 489}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing pan", "1/2 cup sugar", "1 egg yolk", "1/2 tablespoon milk", "12 ounces (about 2 1/3 cups) all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 1/4 pound (5 or 6) Meyer lemons", "1 cup sugar", "5 1/2 ounces (1 stick plus 3 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing pan", "7 large egg yolks", "5 large eggs", "1/8 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: in the bowl of a mixer, cream together butter and sugar.
