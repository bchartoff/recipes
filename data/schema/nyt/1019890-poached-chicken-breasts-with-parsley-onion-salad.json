{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Poached Chicken Breasts With Parsley-Onion Salad", "description": "Slowly poaching bone-in chicken breasts in a very low oven makes the meat extremely silky, without turning it tough or drying it out. And having the oven on for an extended period allows you to cook other things in the gentle heat. Here, halved cherry tomatoes turn sweet and jamlike. A pan of chicken skin renders and crisps, becoming golden and potato-chip crunchy before getting tossed with a bright parsley-onion salad. If you\u2019d rather skip the chicken skin, you can. This dish is nearly as good without it, though you may want to add some toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds to the parsley salad for texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/16/dining/16appe4/16appe4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, poultry", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, chicken breast, olives, fall, winter, low-carb, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 114}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 511, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "927 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 quart chicken stock, plus more as needed (or use salted water)", "2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (3 to 4 split breasts)", "1 bay leaf", "4 garlic cloves", "2 pints cherry tomatoes, halved", "1/2 cup pitted green olives, sliced", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed", "1 rosemary sprig", "1 lemon", "1 cup chopped parsley leaves", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes", "1/2 small red onion, sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven, and heat oven to 275 degrees.
