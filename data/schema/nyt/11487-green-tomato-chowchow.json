{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Tomato Chowchow", "description": "Here is a chunky relish of cabbage and bell pepper commonly served in the South with salty cold cuts and meats. It couldn\u2019t be simpler: simmer chopped vegetables for 15 minutes in a spiced brine \u2014 we use judicious amounts of clove, allspice, cinnamon and toasted coriander \u2014 and pack into jars. We tip the balance more toward green tomato than cabbage when green tomatoes are available because we love the tomatillo-like flavor of a green tomato \u2014 a near-apple flavor, but without the sweetness. It\u2019s a delicious substitute for any relish you would spread over a hot dog or a burger, but we take it in other directions, too. Mixed one-to-one with good mayonnaise, green tomato chowchow makes the perfect dressing for coleslaw. Sometimes we\u2019ll strain out the brine before we add the mayonnaise to make a killer tartar sauce. Or if we\u2019re feeling indulgent, we\u2019ll drain the chowchow, toss it with squid or small bay scallops and flood it with a fruity extra virgin olive oil for easy mock-ceviche.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Matt Lee And Ted Lee"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/13/dining/chowchow-still/chowchow-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "cabbage, tomato, side dish, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 27}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 44, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "186 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 whole allspice berries", "1 teaspoon celery seed", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon coriander seed, toasted", "2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 quart apple cider vinegar", "1 cup light brown sugar", "3 cups green cabbage, cut into small dice (from 1/2 pound green cabbage)", "3 cups Spanish onion, cut into small dice (from 1 1/4 pounds Spanish onions)", "2 cups red bell pepper, cut into small dice (from 3/4 pounds red bell peppers)", "6 cups green tomatoes, cut into small dice (from 2 1/4 pounds green tomatoes)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pound the dry seasonings together in a mortar."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring vinegar, sugar, and 2/3 cup water to a boil in a large stockpot, stirring to dissolve sugar.
