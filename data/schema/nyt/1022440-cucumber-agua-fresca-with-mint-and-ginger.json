A simple syrup of bruised mint and sugar adds sweetness. Agua fresca, a chilled nonalcoholic drink popular in Mexico and Central America, is most often made by blending fruit or soaked grains or by steeping plant blossoms in water. The mix is then strained, sweetened and served chilled. Enjoy this cucumber version as is, or add a splash of gin to turn it into a light aperitif or a delightful afternoon cocktail.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/28/dining/yk-agua-fresca/yk-agua-fresca-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "cucumber, ginger, mint, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 501}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 packed cups fresh mint leaves, plus sprigs for garnish", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 cup hot water", "2 English cucumbers, ends trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger (about 2 ounces), scrubbed and chopped", "1 lime, plus more as needed", "Ice cubes, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine the mint leaves, sugar and salt, and crush them all together using a fork or the back of a wooden spoon just until the mint is bruised.
