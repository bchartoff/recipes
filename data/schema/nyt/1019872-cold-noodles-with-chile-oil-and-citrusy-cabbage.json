{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cold Noodles With Chile Oil and Citrusy Cabbage", "description": "While cold chile noodles are often seen as a side dish, here they act as the anchor of the entire meal. They are delicious on their own, and it would be hard to go wrong with any pairing. A salad of fresh herbs (cilantro, dill, mint, parsley) topped by a creamy tahini dressing is a good place to start. From there, feel free to include a mess of citrusy cabbage and whatever blanched, roasted or raw vegetables you may have on hand for texture. While these suggestions are optional (it doesn't have to be vegetarian: shredded rotisserie chicken or last night's pork chop would also be welcome), seek out saucy, herby, crunchy, tangy and spicy ingredients to liven up an already lively bowl of noodles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/02/dining/02Roman-C/merlin_148228458_814e4753-c89a-45ac-a80d-8bd7e484722c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, noodles", "keywords": "cabbage, scallion, tahini, main course, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 483}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup canola or grapeseed oil", "1 tablespoon fennel seed", "1 tablespoon red-pepper flakes", "2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped", "1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns (optional)", "1 star anise (optional)", "1 pound udon, soba or rice noodles, or spaghetti", "2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar, or fresh lemon or lime juice", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "1/2 head red cabbage, very thinly sliced", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "1/4 cup fresh lemon and-or lime juice", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon and-or lime zest", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/3 cup tahini", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 cup parsley and-or cilantro, tender leaves and stems, very finely chopped", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "1 bunch scallions, very thinly sliced", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon or lime zest", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "More spicy things: Jarred pickled chiles, pickled jalape\u00f1os, Calabrian chiles \u2014 anything of the sort that will (lightly) set your mouth on fire are welcomed here.", "Toasted seeds or nuts: Toast sesame seeds, chopped peanuts or almonds in a dry skillet until golden brown and toss with a little oil and salt; sprinkle over everything."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil, fennel seed, pepper flakes, garlic, Sichuan peppercorns and star anise (if using) in a small pot over the lowest heat possible.
