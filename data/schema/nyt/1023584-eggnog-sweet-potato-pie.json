Spiked with two shots of rum, the roasted sweet potato custard filling becomes more complex in its earthy natural sweetness and almost like mousse in its lightness. You can dress up this pie without any expertise in crimping dough, you simply roll and cut dough scraps, then coat them with sugar and stick them to the edge of the pie crust.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/13/dining/13PIESREX-sweet-potato/13PIESREX-sweet-potato-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "fall, winter, heavy cream, make-ahead, nutmeg, pie, pie dough, rum, sweet potato, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 237}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/453 grams sweet potatoes (2 medium), scrubbed", "1 disk\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023573\">All-Butter Pie Crust</a>", "All-purpose flour, for rolling", "2 tablespoons sparkling or other coarse sugar", "1 cup/230 grams heavy cream", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "3 tablespoons rum or 3/4 teaspoon rum extract", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "3 large eggs, at room temperature, plus 1 egg, beaten, for the crust"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
