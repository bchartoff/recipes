{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Fennel and Grape Salad", "description": "When fennel is kissed by an oven\u2019s fiery heat, its strong anise flavor is toned down and replaced by a mellow char and sweetness. Similarly, roasting grapes intensifies the fruit\u2019s juices, deepens its flavor and takes off the acidic edge, giving way to more of a dark, almost winelike character. Together, the roasted fennel and grapes make a lovely warm winter salad, enhanced by a zingy shallot-citrus vinaigrette. The whole lot gets topped off with crunchy, toasted walnuts and a generous shower of Manchego cheese, which lend texture and heft. (You can sub in any sharp and tangy sheep\u2019s milk cheese.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hana Asbrink"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/ha-roasted-fennel-and-grape-salad/merlin_202696365_603bedfb-0390-444d-a6c4-da5d773fcd5e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings, as a side", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "cheese, fennel, grape, walnut, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 459}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup walnut halves", "2 medium fennel bulbs, about 1\u00bd to 2 pounds, stalks removed, a few green fronds reserved for garnish", "1 1/2 cups red seedless grapes", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 wedge of Manchego cheese (about 2 ounces), rind removed", "1/2 small shallot, thinly sliced into rings", "1 1/2 tablespoons sherry vinegar", "1 teaspoon orange zest plus 2 tablespoons juice (from about 1/2 orange)", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/8 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
