{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pescado Frito (Fried Red Snapper)", "description": "Fishing is an extraordinarily complex issue in Puerto Rico. Much of the seafood eaten doesn\u2019t come from the island\u2019s own waters, in part because of arcane legislation that controls fishing rights. And yet, whole deep-fried fish is a staple on the island, particularly along the west and southwest coast. There, you\u2019ll find red snapper, simply marinated in adobo, fried and served with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020516-tostones-fried-green-plantains\">tostones</a>, avocado salad and white rice. It is, in my opinion, the absolute best way to enjoy a whole fish. The frying turns the head and the tail into a crunchy fish chicharr\u00f3n, and the skin and flesh cook evenly, keeping the flesh moist and the skin crisp. While bones are often a concern for those uncomfortable eating whole fish, there\u2019s a simple solution: Eat it with your hands. Your fingers will do a much better job of finding bones than your fork will, and the experience is more visceral, and delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/22Puertoricanrex2-Pescado/merlin_184863111_18544d19-964f-4900-a5be-b1a63c68f66a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, seafood, main course", "keywords": "lime, puerto rican, red snapper, vegetable oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 87}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lime, juiced (about 2 tablespoons)", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 medium garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/4 teaspoon store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022006-sazon\">homemade saz\u00f3n</a>", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 (1 1/2- to 2-pound) red snapper, cleaned, scaled and gilled", "1 1/2 quarts vegetable oil", "Lime wedges, hot sauce and chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the adobo: Combine all the adobo ingredients and grind them together in a large pil\u00f3n or mortar and pestle, or simply mix them together in a small bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the fish: Make three shallow crosswise cuts on both sides of the surface of the fish skin, then place it in a deep container with a lid or a large resealable bag.
