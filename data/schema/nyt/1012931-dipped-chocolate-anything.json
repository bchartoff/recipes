{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dipped Chocolate Anything", "description": "Tempering chocolate is not hard, but it\u2019s a little bit tricky. You definitely need a candy thermometer (old-fashioned or digital) to measure three or four temperatures: roughly 115 degrees Fahrenheit and 91 and 88 degrees. Melt the chocolate slowly in a double boiler  to about 115 degrees. Then to bring the temperature to dipping perfection (91 degrees), add more unmelted chocolate to the pot until the temperature is 91. At that point you can start dipping \u2014 fruit, graham crackers, cookies \u2014 whatever. When the chocolate reaches 88 degrees, if it lasts that long, the dipping must stop. But don\u2019t worry, you can reheat the chocolate.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/01/dining/dippingchocolate/dippingchocolate-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Enough for 20 to 30 dips", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, chocolate, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 40}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds good-quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped into bean-size pieces (by hand or in a food processor)", "Pretzels, graham crackers, dried fruit or anything for dipping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 1 1/2 pounds chocolate in top of a double boiler (or clean metal bowl set over simmering water).
