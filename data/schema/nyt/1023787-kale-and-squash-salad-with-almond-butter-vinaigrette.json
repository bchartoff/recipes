{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kale and Squash Salad With Almond-Butter Vinaigrette", "description": "For a creamy, rich and dairy-free salad dressing, use almond butter instead of olive oil. It provides rich savoriness and body, like mild tahini or peanut butter. In this recipe, mix it with lemon and mustard to dress a combination of sturdy greens, roasted squash and crisp apples. Embellish as you wish by adding salty cheese, like blue, Gruy\u00e8re or pecorino; freshness with fennel, parsley, mint or pomegranate seeds; or heft with whole grains or beans. This hearty salad is easy to tote to work for lunch and exciting enough for dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/03/multimedia/as-kale-and-squash-salad-1-e8b7/as-kale-and-squash-salad-1-e8b7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course, side dish", "keywords": "almond butter, apple, collard greens, kale, lemon juice, make-ahead, salad, squash, dairy-free, vegan, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 608}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds winter squash, such as butternut or delicata, halved lengthwise, seeded and sliced crosswise \u00bd inch thick (no need to peel)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt", "2 crisp eating apples such as Honeycrisp or Pink Lady", "1 shallot, thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon lemon zest plus \u00bc cup fresh lemon juice (from about 2 lemons)", "1 large bunch Tuscan kale or collard greens (about 1 pound), ribs removed and leaves sliced about \u00bc inch thick\u00a0", "\u00bc cup almond butter", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "\u00bd teaspoon black pepper or red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees.
