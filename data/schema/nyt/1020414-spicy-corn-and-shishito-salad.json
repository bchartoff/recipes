{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Corn and Shishito Salad", "description": "In this recipe, shishito peppers are sliced, lightly saut\u00e9ed, then tossed with raw summer corn and a cumin-lime vinaigrette for a summer salad that\u2019s crunchy, smoky and a little spicy. Traditionally used in Japanese and Korean cooking, shishitos are small, thin-skinned green peppers that have become increasingly popular in the United States. They are typically mild in flavor, but the occasional pepper packs a spicy punch. If you can\u2019t find them, use diced green bell peppers in their place. Finally, cilantro-averse cooks can substitute fresh mint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/20/dining/lh-spicy-corn-and-shishito-pepper-salad/merlin_159456582_e1821838-c8e9-494d-8c95-ba5191f6047f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, cilantro, corn, cotija, cumin, jalape\u00f1o, lime, red onion, shishito, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 422}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "Kosher salt", "1/3 cup diced red onion", "1 garlic clove, minced", "3 cups fresh corn kernels (from 4 to 6 ears of corn)", "6 ounces shishito peppers, stemmed and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices, or green bell peppers, stemmed and diced", "1 large jalape\u00f1o, seeds and ribs removed, diced", "1/4 cup grated Cotija or crumbled feta cheese (optional), or to taste", "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, whisk 2 tablespoons olive oil with the lime juice, cumin and 3/4 teaspoon salt.
