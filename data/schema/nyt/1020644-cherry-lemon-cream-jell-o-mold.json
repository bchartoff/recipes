{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cherry-Lemon Cream Jell-O Mold", "description": "This jiggly, layered mold holds a base of clear crimson (sweet cherry) and a topping of ivory white (tangy lemon mixed with sour cream). If you have extra time, you could make it into four layers, producing red and ivory stripes. Garnished with shiny green leaves like bay or holly, it looks especially festive, and is also quite delicious. Swapping out some of the water in the Jell-O formula for ingredients like sour cream and cherry juice gives this dessert its bright taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/25moldsrex/merlin_164466384_88b76c64-aaa5-4e72-afad-f174cf5b3b28-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "parfaits and trifles", "keywords": "black cherry jell-o, cherry juice, lemon jell-o, sour cream, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 137}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large (6-ounce) package lemon Jell-O", "4 cups boiling water", "1 (16-ounce) container sour cream", "Neutral cooking spray", "2 large (6-ounce) packages black cherry Jell-O, or use plain cherry or cranberry Jell-O", "1 quart sweet or tart cherry juice, or use cranberry juice (opt for less cloudy varieties)", "Fresh holly sprigs, bay leaves or edible flowers, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour lemon mix into a medium bowl and add 2 cups boiling water.
