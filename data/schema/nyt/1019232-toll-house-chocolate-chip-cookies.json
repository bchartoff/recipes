{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookies", "description": "In the 1930s, Ruth Wakefield, the inventor of the chocolate chip cookie, ran the Toll House Inn, a popular restaurant in eastern Massachusetts, with her husband. Using an ice pick, Wakefield broke a semisweet chocolate bar into little bits, mixed them into brown-sugar dough, and the chocolate chip cookie was born. In 1939, she sold Nestl\u00e9 the rights to reproduce her recipe on its packages (reportedly for only $1) and was hired to write recipes for the company, which supposedly supplied her with free chocolate for life. This recipe is very close to Mrs. Wakefield's original (hers called for a teaspoon of hot water and 1/2-teaspoon-sized cookies), and the one you'll still find on the back of every yellow bag of Nestl\u00e9 chocolate chips.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/dining/tollhouse-cookies/merlin_150672999_92f7eb0d-5f5c-4fe0-baa4-8935414e67d2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "5 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 840}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 94, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "49 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups\u00a0all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon\u00a0baking soda", "1 teaspoon\u00a0salt", "1 cup butter (2 sticks), softened", "3/4 cup\u00a0granulated sugar", "3/4 cup\u00a0packed brown sugar", "1 teaspoon\u00a0vanilla extract", "2\u00a0large eggs", "2 cups/12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips", "1 cup\u00a0chopped nuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375.
