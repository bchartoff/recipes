{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rocky Road Ice Cream Bars", "description": "This recipe takes the classic American ice cream and turns it into simple, festive bars. They start with a no-bake chocolate cookie crust that gets topped with chocolate ice cream, salty toasted nuts and, of course, mini marshmallows, making this a treat everyone will love. Using a rich, dense ice cream is key to these bars, so buy a premium ice cream for this recipe if you can, since some supermarket versions may have a lot of air incorporated. Serve the bars straight from the freezer (with napkins!) or on dessert plates with a drizzle of hot fudge sauce, and watch them disappear.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/30/dining/lh-rocky-road-bars/lh-rocky-road-bars-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets, dessert", "keywords": "fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, valentine\u2019s day, hot fudge sauce, ice cream, marshmallow, nuts, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 146}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "9 tablespoons/125 grams unsalted butter (1 stick plus 1 tablespoon)", "1 (9-ounce/255-gram) package thin chocolate wafer cookies", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups/225 grams raw almonds, walnuts, pecans or a combination, chopped (about 8 ounces)", "2 pints/1 quart chocolate ice cream", "2 cups/115 grams miniature marshmallows", "Store-bought or homemade hot fudge sauce, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Spray a 9-by-13-inch pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.
