{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicories With Pears, Blue Cheese and Secret Anchovy Dressing", "description": "Gently bitter, yet fresh and crunchy, chicories are the perfect canvas on which to create a Thanksgiving salad. With a single anchovy fillet, mustard, vinegar and lemon juice at its base, this light, vibrant dressing is surprisingly refreshing and flavored with a faint rumor of umami that will make you reach \u2014 over the stuffing \u2014 for seconds. If you don\u2019t have, or don\u2019t like, pears, substitute Fuyu persimmons or a crisp, tart apple variety such as Fuji or Honeycrisp. If you don\u2019t like pecans, use walnuts. If you can\u2019t find Roquefort, use another sheep\u2019s milk blue, such as Oregon Blue or Ewe\u2019s Blue, both of which are American-made in the Roquefort-style.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15unboringrex1-salad/merlin_197274795_3768c296-7616-4c1c-9ead-4096469182ce-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "pear, radicchio, roquefort cheese, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 146}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small head fris\u00e9e", "1 head escarole", "1 small head radicchio, such as Castelfranco or Treviso varieties", "1 large anchovy fillet", "1 garlic clove, sliced", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus a pinch more", "3/4 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice", "1 1/2 teaspoons honey", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Black pepper", "1 small shallot, finely diced", "3/4 cups pecans", "1 ripe Comice or Bartlett pear", "3 1/2 ounces Roquefort cheese, at room temperature", "Black pepper", "Flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use a sharp knife to shave off the dark green tips of the fris\u00e9e and escarole, then use your hands to tear off any remaining tough outer leaves, saving only the pale green and white, tender hearts for the salad.
