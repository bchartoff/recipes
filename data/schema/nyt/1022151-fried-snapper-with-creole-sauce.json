{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Snapper With Creole Sauce", "description": "Best enjoyed using local snapper, this bright dish represents the protein part of fish and fungi, a classic duo on dinner tables in the Virgin Islands. The fish is topped with plenty of thyme-laced, tomato-based Creole sauce and is typically served over a bed of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022093-fungi\">fungi</a>, the classic Virgin Islands side dish of buttery cooked cornmeal with sliced, boiled okra. Michael Anthony Watson and Judy Watson, husband-and-wife owners of Petite Pump Room in St. Thomas, traditionally use whole fried snapper for this recipe, but you can use fish fillets. For authenticity, serve them with plenty of hot sauce on the side for a little extra heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Korsha Wilson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/19/dining/14fungirex2/14fungirex2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, seafood, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, snapper, tomato sauce, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 157}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "3 medium yellow onions, halved and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices", "1 red bell pepper, cored and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices", "1 green bell pepper, cored and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices", "4 garlic cloves, sliced", "1 (14-ounce) can tomato sauce", "4 fresh thyme sprigs", "4 teaspoons distilled white vinegar", "4 teaspoons seasoning salt, such as Creole seasoning or Lawry\u2019s", "Kosher salt and ground black pepper", "1/3 cup vegetable oil", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons seasoning salt, such as Creole seasoning or Lawry\u2019s", "4 skin-on red snapper fillets (about 6 ounces each)", "Hot sauce (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the sauce: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium until shimmering.
