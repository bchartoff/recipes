{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Zucchini", "description": "Naturally suited to grilling, zucchini is both juicy and mild, which means it stays moist even when it\u2019s hit with fire, and it soaks up the smoky flavors of the grill in the short time it cooks. Maximize surface area \u2014 and convenience \u2014 by cutting the zucchini into sturdy planks, which cook through quickly without slipping through the grates while still retaining some texture. Brush them with olive oil, season enthusiastically with salt and pepper and grill until crisp-tender to enjoy them as a simple side, tossed into a salad or tucked into sandwiches. If you\u2019d like to show them off, arrange them over some ricotta, then dot with herbs, capers and lemon and serve with grilled bread for an easy seasonal supper. The best summer recipes allow you to embrace technique but customize at whim.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/08/dining/aw-grilled-zucchini/merlin_210788841_2268a008-bd57-4188-99f0-7c7f531a4b23-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 178}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large zucchini (about 8 ounces each), cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch planks", "Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed", "Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 cup fresh ricotta (optional)", "Fresh basil leaves (or other tender herbs, such as dill, mint or oregano), chopped capers and lemon, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the grill for direct grilling and heat over high.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Working on a large baking sheet, brush the zucchini all over with oil, then season generously with salt and pepper.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Once the grill is heated, add the zucchini to the grates in an even layer, leaving about 1 inch between to avoid crowding.
