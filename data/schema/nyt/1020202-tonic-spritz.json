{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tonic Spritz", "description": "This simple variation gets a one-two punch of bitter quinine from both tonic and Lillet Blanc. A fortified white wine-based ap\u00e9ritif made outside Bordeaux, Lillet (pronounced lee-LAY) is golden hued, citrus forward and has been clinking around bars since 1872. Since all the ingredients in the cocktail (Lillet, bubbles, tonic) skew somewhat sweet \u2014 in spite of quinine\u2019s bitter notes \u2014 make sure to seek out both dry tonic and dry sparkling wine to avoid crossing over to saccharine. If you don\u2019t have access to dry tonic, you can also use equal parts tonic and club soda.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/dining/09spritzrex2a/09spritzrex2a-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 cocktail", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "dry sparkling wine, lemon, lillet blanc, tonic water, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 73}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces Lillet Blanc", "3 ounces dry sparkling wine", "1 ounce dry tonic, such as Fever-Tree or Q Tonic", "Lemon twist"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a wine glass with ice, then add the Lillet Blanc.
