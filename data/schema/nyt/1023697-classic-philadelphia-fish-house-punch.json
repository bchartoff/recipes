{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Philadelphia Fish House Punch", "description": "Rum and Cognac mix with a muddled sugar and lemon mixture, known as oleo-saccharum, and peach brandy in this classic punch, which dates back to the early 18th century. If you can\u2019t find peach brandy (a dry, high-proof brandy distilled from peaches, not the saccharine peach-flavored liqueur) swap in a fruit eau de vie, such as apricot, plum, apple or pear. While this recipe is written to be served cold, it can also be served warm: Skip the ice block and gently warm the punch in a large saucepan or Dutch oven before ladling into small, heatproof mugs or tea cups. Hot or cold, finish each serving with a dusting of freshly grated nutmeg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/07/dining/01punchrex1-fish/merlin_216830907_6d33f58a-db38-4d19-9833-1627a67c7686-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H15M", "recipeYield": "18 to 20 (4-ounce) drinks", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cocktails, punches", "keywords": "brandy, cognac, lemon, party, plan-ahead, rum, sugar, christmas, hanukkah, new year\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 89}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 lemons, peeled", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "1 1/2 cups/12 ounces Jamaican rum", "3/4 cup/6 ounces Cognac or brandy", "1/4 cup/2 ounces peach brandy or a fruit eau de vie, such as apricot, apple or plum", "Ice ring or block, for serving (see Tip)", "Freshly grated nutmeg, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the lemon peels in a medium bowl or a large jar, and reserve the lemons.
