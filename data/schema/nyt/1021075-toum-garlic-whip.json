{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Toum (Garlic Whip)", "description": "This toum recipe comes from Marjayoun, Lebanon, where Sameer Eid grew up eating it with shawarma. Samy, Sameer\u2019s son, learned how to make it after he started working at Phoenicia, the family\u2019s restaurant in Birmingham, Mich. \u201cIt took me more attempts than any recipe in my life to get it right,\u201d he said. The key is to be patient during Step 1, to be sure the garlic breaks down enough to later become a creamy, fluffy condiment. Toum is called \u201cgarlic whip\u201d on Phoenicia\u2019s menu. It\u2019s served with roasted chicken and kebabs; some customers even request it with babyback ribs. It\u2019s versatile, and also great drizzled over roasted vegetables and avocado toast.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Brett Anderson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/22/dining/ba-garlic-whip/ba-garlic-whip-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, snack, condiments, side dish", "keywords": "canola oil, garlic, grapeseed oil, lemon, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 443}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup peeled garlic cloves (about 32 cloves, from 3 to 4 whole heads)", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from 3 to 4 lemons)", "3 1/2 cups canola oil or grapeseed oil", "2 tablespoons ice water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place peeled garlic and salt in the bowl of a food processor.
