{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smashed Cucumbers With Cumin Tahini", "description": "Cool, watery cucumbers and warm, rich sesame oil are a classic combination in Asia, and the chef Danny Bowien builds on that tradition here by using sesame paste and smashed cucumbers, which have even more crunch and juice than sliced ones. The lime, oregano and cumin in the dressing can lean either Middle Eastern or Mexican, but in any case they are a perfect pairing for cucumbers. Mr. Bowien adds a pinch of sugar to the strainer; it does wonders for transforming the color and taste of the cucumber peels, which can be bitter. He serves this dish with a funky, fiery drizzle of chorizo oil with dried shrimp and XO sauce, but a little chile paste and vinegar is a fine accent, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/19/dining/19CUKE2/19CUKE2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "cucumber, cumin, tahini, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 80}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 136, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "431 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 2 pounds thin-skinned cucumbers like English or Persian (8 to 10 mini cucumbers, 4 medium-size or 2 large greenhouse)", "Kosher salt", "Raw or granulated sugar", "Freshly squeezed juice of 1 lime or lemon", "1 large clove garlic", "1/3 cup well-stirred tahini", "1 tablespoon olive oil, more for cucumbers", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon dried oregano", "2 tablespoons white sesame seeds, for garnish", "2 to 3 tablespoons sambal oelek or sriracha", "White vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse cucumbers and pat dry.
