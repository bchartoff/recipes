Poaching is an ideal technique for keeping chicken tender and juicy for these sandwiches, but you can swap in roasted, grilled or rotisserie chicken as well. Baby arugula, or a similar leafy green, adds a peppery bite. Be sure to use bread that can hold up to the sandwich fillings \u2014 one with a firm crumb and crunchy crust.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/06/dining/yk-muhammara-chicken-sandwiches/merlin_189026502_58171dd4-b0bc-47c3-aa6a-d910a3f1de4c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, country bread, red pepper, walnut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 381}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (5 to 6 ounces each)", "1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "1 dried bay leaf", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1 (12-ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained (1 cup)", "1 1/2 cups raw walnuts", "1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper or other hot red-pepper flakes", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 teaspoon pomegranate molasses", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "8 slices country white or sourdough bread, or 4 squares ciabatta, split and toasted", "2 cups baby arugula"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Poach the chicken: Place the chicken breasts in a medium saucepan, add enough water to cover by 1 inch and turn the heat to medium-high.
