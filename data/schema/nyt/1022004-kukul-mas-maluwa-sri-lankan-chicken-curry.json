{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kukul Mas Maluwa (Sri Lankan Chicken Curry)", "description": "The hallmarks of this tasty Sri Lankan chicken curry include creamy coconut milk and homemade curry powder, which is made by toasting and grinding whole spices. Don\u2019t let the long ingredient list deter you; once you have everything together, this dish is very easy to make. Tiny bird chiles are small but potent. In Sri Lanka, the curries are spicy, but you can use as few or as many chiles as you\u2019d like. Prepare it in advance and you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s even more delicious the next day. Serve with some long-grain rice and a few different vegetable curries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/28/dining/28Sse-sri-lankan-chicken-curry/merlin_185502381_a7a5416c-c65e-4262-9fcc-7fd054417781-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, curries, poultry, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "chicken, cinnamon, coconut milk, curry, curry leaves, ginger", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 380}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 teaspoons coriander seeds", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds", "2 teaspoons fennel seeds", "1/2 teaspoon cardamom seeds (from about 8 green pods)", "1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns", "20 fresh curry leaves", "1/4 cup coconut oil", "1 medium yellow onion, chopped", "6 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon ground sweet paprika", "2 teaspoons ground turmeric", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3 medium plum tomatoes, chopped", "1 to 3 bird\u2019s-eye chiles, minced", "1 whole (3- to 4-pound) chicken, skin removed, chicken cut into 10 pieces", "2 (6-inch) pieces pandan leaves", "1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick", "1 fresh lemongrass stalk, trimmed, cut into 4-inch lengths, and bashed lightly", "1 cup full-fat coconut milk", "2 teaspoons white vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small skillet, combine the coriander, cumin, fennel, cardamom, peppercorns and 15 curry leaves.
