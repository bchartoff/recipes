{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gungjung Tteokbokki (Korean Royal Court Rice Cakes)", "description": "This savory-sweet rice cake dish is similar to the tteokbokki that was served in the Korean royal court during the Joseon Dynasty. Its <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012791-spicy-korean-rice-cakes-tteokbokki\">spicy gochujang-rich younger cousin</a> is better-known, but this milder version was created before the introduction of chile peppers to Korean cuisine. Gungjung tteokbokki has a complex sauce of roasted sesame oil, soy sauce and aromatics. Beef, vegetables and chewy-tender rice cakes, which are sold in the refrigerated section of Korean markets, are simmered with the sauce until it reduces to a velvety glaze. For a vegetarian meal, simply omit the beef. (The mushrooms add plenty of meaty flavor.) Mung bean sprouts add texture, but they can be left out, if you can\u2019t find them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/28/dining/kc-tteokbokki/merlin_186997692_0fbd60bd-ed0e-4b1f-adc7-9ebd34d61c21-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, one pot, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "beef, shiitake, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 402}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons turbinado sugar", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 cup finely chopped scallions", "1/2 teaspoon roasted sesame oil", "4 ounces beef rib-eye or sirloin steak", "1 pound 2-inch-long cylindrical rice cakes", "2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "1/2 small yellow onion, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)", "4 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced 1/4-inch-thick", "1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced 1/4-inch-thick", "1 cup mung bean sprouts", "Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, sugar, garlic, black pepper, 2 tablespoons of the scallions and 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.
