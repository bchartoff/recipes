We use tinned sardines here, for ease, but you can obviously substitute with fresh sardines, scaled and boned. You'll also want to pay attention to the total weight or volume of the mackerel: Some types are larger than others. All work here, but you may not need to buy as many fillets. Serve with some couscous or rice and a spoonful of yogurt, if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/16/dining/16ottorex1/merlin_137834622_1ebd5480-a425-4e80-b958-dbbf38c176dd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meatballs, seafood", "keywords": "cardamom, mackerel, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 91}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/3 cup/75 milliliters olive oil", "8 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "3 green chile peppers, such as serrano, finely sliced (and seeded if you don\u2019t like heat)", "Salt", "2 large celery stalks, trimmed and finely chopped", "1 banana shallot (or a large regular shallot), finely chopped", "1 pound/500 grams ripe vine tomatoes (4 to 5 medium), blitzed in a food processor for 1 minute (or use 2 cups canned tomato pur\u00e9e)", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 teaspoons granulated or caster sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 teaspoon lime zest, plus 1 tablespoon lime juice (from 1 lime)", "8 cardamom pods, crushed in a mortar and pestle, skins discarded\u00a0(or use a scant 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom)", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/200 milliliters dry white wine", "2 tablespoons/5 grams finely chopped cilantro or coriander leaves, for serving", "2 tablespoons/5 grams finely chopped dill, for serving", "4 mackerel fillets (from 2 roughly 1-pound/500-gram fish), skin and pin bones removed, flesh roughly chopped into 3/4-inch/2-centimeter pieces (for about 12 ounces/320 grams of chopped fish)", "About 5 ounces/150 grams drained tinned sardines in olive oil, roughly chopped", "1 heaping tablespoon/10 grams pistachios, roughly chopped", "1/2 cup/10 grams loosely packed roughly chopped fresh dill", "1 loosely packed cup/15 grams roughly chopped fresh cilantro leaves (coriander leaves)", "1 tablespoon finely grated zest (from 2 limes); cut the zested limes into wedges or juice them, for serving", "1 green chile pepper (such as serrano), finely chopped", "1 egg, beaten", "5 tablespoons/70 grams potato flour, divided", "3 tablespoons/50 milliliters vegetable oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start with the sauce: In a large saut\u00e9 pan (choose one that has a lid), heat olive oil, garlic, half the sliced chile pepper and a good pinch of salt over medium-low heat.
