{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Caprese", "description": "Originating in Capri, Caprese mimics the colors of the Italian flag in salad form using the now-classic combination of mozzarella, tomato and basil. Here, that trinity transforms everyday chicken cutlets into something special. Thanks to the proliferation of hothouse tomatoes (which are better enjoyed cooked than raw), this dish can be enjoyed year-round. Cocktail tomatoes, slightly larger than a golf ball and often sold on the vine, are perfect for this, but any size will work. Simple to assemble, this dish forms its own delicious pan sauce as the liquid from the cheese and tomatoes mingles with the caramelized juices from the browned chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/dining/ss-chicken-caprese/ss-chicken-caprese-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, one pot, poultry", "keywords": "basil, chicken breast, mozzarella, pesto, tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1240}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "8 ounces mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch slices", "6 ounces cocktail or other tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch slices", "1 1/2 cups loosely packed fresh basil leaves", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "Pesto, store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/2653-basic-pesto\">homemade</a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken dry.
