{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole-Grain Blueberry Buckle", "description": "A buckle is an old-fashioned cake that has a crumble topping and fruit that makes the batter buckle, or sink, as it bakes. Or at least that\u2019s what all the recipes I\u2019ve read say is supposed to happen. When I made the cake the blueberries didn\u2019t really cause it to buckle at all, they just  formed a layer on top of the cake. This is now a favorite dessert. It\u2019s not traditional at all, as I use whole-wheat flour, and oats and quinoa flour in the topping.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/20/science/20recipehealth/20recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 8-inch cake, serving 9 to 12", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner", "keywords": "dessert, halal, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 125}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 257, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "210 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["20 grams rolled oats (about 3 tablespoons, approximately)", "60 grams quinoa flour (1/2 cup, approximately; grind quinoa in a spice mill to make the flour)", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "50 grams unrefined turbinado sugar (1/4 cup, approximately)", "1/8 teaspoon salt (to taste)", "60 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (4 tablespoons/2 ounces)", "125 grams whole- wheat flour (1 cup, approximately)", "65 grams unbleached all-purpose flour (1/2 cup, approximately)", "5 grams baking powder (1 teaspoon, approximately)", "1 gram baking soda (1/4 teaspoon, approximately)", "3 grams fine sea salt (scant 1/2 teaspoon, approximately)", "90 grams unsalted butter, preferably French-style such as Plugr\u00e0, at room temperature (6 tablespoons/3 ounces)", "120 grams sugar, preferably organic (scant 1/2 cup, approximately)", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "2 eggs, at room temperature", "130 grams buttermilk or kefir (1/2 cup)", "350 grams blueberries (2 1/4 cups, approximately/ 2 boxes), divided"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
