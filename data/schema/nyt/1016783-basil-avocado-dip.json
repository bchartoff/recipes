{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basil Avocado Dip", "description": "This unexpected dip is a terrific way to use ripe avocados when guacamole isn\u2019t an option. It\u2019s mild, creamy, and perfectly balanced between sweet and tart. The only downside is that it only keeps for about day in the fridge, so plan on making it the night before packing it into someone\u2019s lunchbox if that\u2019s its destination. Serve it with pita or tortilla chips, breadsticks and cucumber slices, and double the recipe if you\u2019re feeding a crowd.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/03/dining/03APPE2/03APPE2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, avocado, greek yogurt, honey, lime juice", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 164}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 316, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "199 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 7-ounce container Greek yogurt (1 scant cup)", "1 ripe avocado, pitted and peeled", "1/2 teaspoon honey, or to taste", "1 to 2 teaspoons lime juice, or to taste", "1/4 cup chopped fresh basil", "1 garlic clove, chopped", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Pinch of fine sea salt, more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all ingredients in bowl of a food processor.
