{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Plantains With Beans, Scallions and Lemon", "description": "Bright and earthy flavors complement each another in this easy dish in which cooked beans are tossed with lemon zest, olive oil and cayenne, and roasted sweet plantains are coated in a brown sugar, ginger and lemon glaze. Go with ripe plantains for this recipe, yellow and spotted with large black dots. You\u2019ll need your oven's broiler setting to help caramelize the sugary coating on the plantains, and to char the scallion garnish. This dish is the perfect breakfast topped with a jammy egg, a quick lunch over a bed of fresh greens, or a satisfying side to roast chicken.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/18/dining/yk-plantains/yk-plantains-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, beans, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "brown sugar, ginger, lemon, plantain, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 636}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 pounds ripe plantains (about 4 medium), yellow and spotted with large black dots", "6 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "1 lemon, zested and juiced, plus more as needed", "1 3/4 cups or 1 (15-ounce) can drained cooked beans, such as navy, cannellini, black-eyed peas or butter beans", "1/4 cup minced red onion", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "2 bunches scallions (about 10 to 12 scallions), trimmed", "Kosher salt", "1/4 cup fresh dill fronds", "1/4 cup fresh cilantro, leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
