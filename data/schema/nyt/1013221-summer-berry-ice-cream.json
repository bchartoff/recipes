From the perspective of a home cook, egg-free ice creams are simpler than custard-based ones, and more foolproof. You don\u2019t have to worry about tempering the yolks, or fear curdling.  To soften the texture of egg-free ice creams, which otherwise freeze rock solid, David Lebovitz, author of \u201cThe Perfect Scoop,\u201d advised adding a few spoonfuls of alcohol or a liquid sweetener like honey or maple syrup. Adding more sugar also helps the texture, said Nick Morgenstern of Morgenstern\u2019s Finest Ice Cream, but so does simply leaving the ice cream at room temperature \u2014 or better, in the refrigerator \u2014 until soft enough to scoop.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/11/dining/berry-ice-cream/berry-ice-cream-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About a quart", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "berries, heavy cream, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 168}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 271, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "52 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 cups berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries combined)", "2 cups heavy cream", "1/3 cup sugar, plus 2 tablespoons, as needed", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons vodka"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, mash berries with a fork or potato masher until just slightly chunky."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a saucepan over medium-low heat, bring cream to a simmer with 1/3 cup sugar and the salt.
