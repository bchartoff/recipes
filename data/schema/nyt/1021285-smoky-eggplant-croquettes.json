{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smoky Eggplant Croquettes", "description": "By placing whole, unwashed, plain and naked globe eggplants directly onto the stovetop burner grate and letting them burn until charred, hissing and collapsed, you bring a haunting smokiness and profound silkiness to the interior flesh that will have you hooked for the rest of your life. This way of cooking eggplant is a revelation in itself \u2014 easy, yet exciting and engaging \u2014 and requires nothing more of the home cook than a little seasoning at the end to be enjoyed, as is. But biting into a warm, crisp, golden fried croquette with that smoky, silken pur\u00e9e at its center is what restaurant-level complexity and satisfaction is all about. One key ingredient, but 11 steps to prepare it \u2014 that about sums up the difference between home cooking and restaurant excitement.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/02/magazine/02mag-eat/02mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H30M", "recipeYield": "About 16 croquettes", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "eggplant, flour, garlic, lemon, olive oil, panko", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 522}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large globe eggplants (about 2 1/2 pounds total)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 garlic cloves, peeled", "Kosher salt", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "3 whole eggs, beaten with 1/4 cup water", "2 cups panko bread crumbs, ground as fine as freeze-dried instant milk, or plain fine bread crumbs", "Canola, grapeseed or other neutral oil, for stovetop shallow frying", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the whole eggplants directly on the burner grids of the stovetop, and turn the flames to high.
