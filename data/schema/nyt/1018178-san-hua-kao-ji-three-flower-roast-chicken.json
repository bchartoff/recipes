{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "San Hua Kao Ji, Three-Flower Roast Chicken", "description": "This dish is similar to the classic Sichuan tea-smoked duck, which uses Sichuan peppercorn in a gentler way than that usually associated with the cuisine. With very lightly dressed greens, it makes a light summer meal. As a Chinese meal, it is served as a warm or room temperature starter and would pair well with stir-fried greens and plain steamed rice. The chicken has a wonderful delicate texture, thanks to the Chinese poaching technique, which keeps the meat silky and moist.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Chris Buckley"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/15/dining/15JPSICHUAN4/15JPSICHUAN4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, Chinese rice wine, ginger, jasmine tea, sichuan peppercorns, star anise, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 330, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "25 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "669 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons kosher salt", "2 tablespoons Chinese rice wine, like liao jiu or Shaoxing", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon red\u00a0Sichuan\u00a0peppercorns", "1 tablespoon good-quality jasmine tea leaves", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped scallion", "1 tablespoon coarsely chopped peeled fresh ginger", "1 3- to 3 1/2-pound whole chicken", "1/2 cup kosher salt", "5 dried whole red chile peppers, about 3 inches long", "3 tablespoons good-quality jasmine tea leaves", "3 whole scallions, coarsely chopped", "3 1/4-inch-thick slices ginger", "2 whole star anise", "6 bay leaves", "1/4 cup good-quality jasmine tea leaves", "2 whole scallions", "2 1/4-inch-thick slices ginger", "1 whole star anise", "2 bay leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate the chicken: Combine all marinade ingredients in a blender or food processor and pulse into a coarse paste.
