{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Locro de Gallina (Chicken Soup With Squash, Green Plantains and Yuca)", "description": "Derived from a Quechua term for a hearty soup-stew hybrid, locro originated in the Andes mountain range but today encompasses a glut of South American soups that vary from country to country, and household to household. Originally made with varying combinations of squash, corn, beans and potatoes, locro has transformed regionally to include ingredients like poached eggs and thinly shaved brisket. This Bolivian recipe starts with chicken broth seasoned with turmeric, paprika and annatto seeds, and uses squash, plantains and yuca, but feel free to use whatever vegetables you have in your fridge. Make sure to keep the pieces large so they don\u2019t disintegrate into the soup as it simmers; cutting them with your spoon as you eat is part of the experience.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ham El-Waylly"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/09/multimedia/hew-locro-de-gallina-1-27e6/hew-locro-de-gallina-1-27e6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "south american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "butternut squash, chicken soup, garlic, ground turmeric, hot paprika, plantain, rice, whole chicken, yuca", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole (4-pound) chicken (back and neck reserved, if available)", "2 tablespoons neutral oil", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon ground hot paprika", "1/2 teaspoon annatto seeds (optional)", "1 medium yellow onion, finely diced", "8 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 fresh or dried bay leaf", "Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper", "1/3 cup white rice, rinsed", "1 medium yuca (about 1 \u00bd pounds)", "1 medium butternut squash (1 \u00bd to 2 \u00bd pounds)", "2 green (unripe) plantains (about 6 ounces each)", "1 tablespoon dried oregano", "6 eggs (optional)", "1/3 cup roughly chopped parsley leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the chicken into 10 parts: Place the chicken on a cutting board, breast side up.
