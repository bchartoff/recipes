Ms. Koslow prefers grapeseed oil for its high smoke point and clean taste. But to mix things up, you can combine grapeseed oil with a more flavorful oil such as virgin coconut, olive oil, butter, duck fat, or bacon grease. Use 1/4 cup of each. After popping, you can toss the kernels with just salt (they won't need any more fat by way of butter) or a flavorful spice mix. Here, they're tossed with nutritional yeast, which gives them a Parmesan-like umami flavor, along with a little rosemary or kelp powder for depth.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/27/dining/27apperex-cheesy/merlin_139780497_f4b10aa9-d467-452f-b9fa-2d4ec14b3c64-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 12 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods", "keywords": "nutritional yeast, popcorn, rosemary, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 194}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 216, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "83 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup grapeseed or other neutral oil with a high smoke point (such as corn, canola, or sunflower)", "1/3 cup popcorn kernels", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 cup nutritional yeast", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary or powdered kelp seaweed, crushed to a powder", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot set over medium-high heat, heat oil and 3 popcorn kernels.
