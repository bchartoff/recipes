{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Easy Duck Confit", "description": "The name of this recipe may seem laughable. Isn\u2019t confit meant to be an arduous, messy, not-really-easy thing to make at home? Doesn\u2019t it involve large quantities of hot liquid fat and even larger reserves of patience? Surely chefs have a trick to getting those duck legs to be so rich, so luxurious? This version is not traditional, and it is still a time investment for home cooks (the legs are cured for 24 hours, and then cooked for about 3 \u00bd hours more). But by allowing the duck legs to cook in their own rendered fat, rather than adding quarts of extra fat to the pan, you have a recipe that is far less of a pain to both prepare and clean up. And the method is truly simple, with results that are just as outrageously good. The duck lasts for at least 5 days in the refrigerator, and should be reheated in a 350-oven until warm. Then run the legs under the broiler until crisp.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/01/dining/duck-confit/duck-confit-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "duck, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 270}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 bay leaf, crumbled", "8 moulard duck legs (about 4 pounds total), rinsed and patted dry but not trimmed", "Roasted potatoes, noodles or sturdy salad greens for serving", "Bitter salad greens such as arugula, chicory and/or radicchio, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, thyme and bay leaf pieces.
