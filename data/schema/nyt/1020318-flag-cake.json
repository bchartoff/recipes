{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Flag Cake", "description": "Layered with whipped cream, raspberry pur\u00e9e, saltines and fresh fruit, this easy icebox cake balances bright, fresh flavors with tangy cream cheese. The saltines add a nice saltiness, but you can substitute graham crackers or even chocolate wafers if you prefer things on the sweeter side. The addition of cream cheese makes the icebox filling thicker and more stable. And, while the cream firms up, the saltines absorb its moisture, becoming tender and making the cake easy to cut into impressively striped slices.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/24/dining/em-icebox-cake/em-icebox-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings (Makes one 5-by-9-inch cake)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "blueberries, cream cheese, raspberries, saltine crackers, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 486}, "recipeIngredient": ["18 ounces/510 grams fresh raspberries or thawed frozen raspberries", "2/3 cup/135 grams granulated sugar", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "8 ounces/225 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "3 cups/720 milliliters heavy cream, chilled", "48 saltine crackers", "Fresh raspberries and blueberries, for finishing", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the raspberry pur\u00e9e: In a medium saucepan, stir together the raspberries, sugar and salt.
