{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crustless Egg and Cheese Quiche", "description": "If you love quiche, get to know this crustless version, dotted with cheese, mushrooms and herbs (and no fussy pastry to chill or roll). Once you master the perfect dairy-to-egg ratio, you\u2019ll find this recipe to be as much of an ally to the Friday fridge clean-out as it is to a brunch for friends. Pay close attention to the baking time: The center should be a touch wiggly when you remove the quiche from the oven. The end result is a quivering, spoonable custard that melts in your mouth, to be served with a bracing salad. Crisp greens with mustardy vinaigrette, or a citrus laced endive and radicchio number \u2014 anything in that vein will do.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": ""}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/20/dining/sc-crustless-quiche2/sc-crustless-quiche2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, casseroles", "keywords": "cheddar, eggs, gruy\u00e8re, parmesan, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 200}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 407, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "563 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons\u00a0unsalted\u00a0butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 tablespoons fine plain dry bread crumbs", "2 heaping cups/4 ounces stemmed and thinly sliced wild or button mushrooms", "1 cup grated cheese, such as Comt\u00e9, Gruy\u00e8re, Emmental or Cheddar", "1 cup half-and-half or heavy cream", "1 cup whole milk", "4 eggs, lightly beaten", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 1 ounce)", "2 tablespoons finely chopped chives, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees with the rack positioned at the top.
