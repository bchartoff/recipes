{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Han Oak Galbijjim", "description": "This is a home cook\u2019s take on the short-rib stew the chef Peter Cho serves at Han Oak, the beautiful homestyle Korean restaurant in Portland, Ore., that he runs with his wife, Sun Young Park. It is fragrant and sweet, with deep caramelized flavors that come in part from roasting the meat and vegetables separately before combining them in the braising liquid. Cho fries rice cakes before adding them to the stew, but you can just slide them in plain, if you prefer. Either way, the addition of greens at the end gives the dish an exciting brightness, a zip that many galbijjims lack.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/20/magazine/20mag-eat-slide-A0VW/20mag-eat-slide-A0VW-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "meat, one pot", "keywords": "Coca-Cola, gochugaru, kale, radish, short ribs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 562}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds mixed root vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, onions and sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces", "5 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola or vegetable oil", "Kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "4 pounds bone-in short ribs, cut by a butcher into 2-inch pieces", "2 medium-size Asian pears, peeled, cored and diced", "1 large red onion, peeled and diced", "12 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped ginger", "3 cups chicken stock", "1 12-ounce can Coca-Cola", "1/4 cup honey", "1/2 cup soy sauce", "1/4 cup rice-wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean chile flakes), or to taste", "4 cups roughly chopped kale, optional", "1 pound Korean rice cakes, optional", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "3 scallions, trimmed and both white and green parts thinly sliced", "3 radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced", "Sesame seeds, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425.
