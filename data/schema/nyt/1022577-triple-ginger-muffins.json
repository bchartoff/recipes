{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Triple-Ginger Muffins", "description": "A baked good for the true ginger fanatic, these muffins pack some serious spice thanks to the addition of grated fresh ginger, ground ginger and minced crystallized ginger. Molasses, a key ingredient in traditional gingerbread, gives the muffins a beautiful golden hue and helps keep them moist for days \u2014 if they last that long. (Any variety of molasses will work here, but there may be some color variation depending on the brand used.) For larger, bakery-style muffins, use a jumbo muffin pan and bake the muffins for a few extra minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/22/dining/lh-triple-ginger-muffins/merlin_194651865_68bdc280-e309-48e3-b821-2b7a1c3571d4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "12 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch", "keywords": "crystallized ginger, ginger, milk, molasses, muffin", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 692}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/201 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "3/4 cup whole milk", "1/4 cup molasses", "1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger (from a 2-inch piece)", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "3/4 cup/108 grams, plus 3 tablespoons/27 grams minced crystallized ginger"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees and line a standard muffin tin with paper liners."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, butter, eggs, milk, molasses and grated ginger, and whisk until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, ground ginger and salt.
