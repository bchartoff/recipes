{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beans Marbella", "description": "This recipe started as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/dining/chicken-marbella-without-the-chicken.html\">a wisp of an idea</a> in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-veggie\">The Veggie</a>, our weekly newsletter about vegetarian home cooking, inspired by that iconic dish chicken Marbella, made famous in \u201cThe Silver Palate Cookbook.\u201d Instead of chicken, a pot of thin-skinned, creamy beans and their rich cooking liquid form the base, which are then added to a pan of fried garlic and reduced red wine with plenty of olive oil, prunes and olives. They\u2019re then topped with a simple roasted potato salad, dressed with vinegar-soaked shallots, capers and parsley. It\u2019s not an exact replica of chicken Marbella, but it\u2019s a beautiful and satisfying way to enjoy its familiar flavors \u2014 the tangy, briny sharpness of vinegar, capers and olives, set against the sweetness of prunes. You can serve the dish as is, but it\u2019s even more luxurious with some thickly sliced and toasted bread, brushed with olive oil and garlic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao and Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/20/dining/TR-Beans-Marbella/TR-Beans-Marbella-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "beans, capers, olives, potato, prune, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 775}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried beans (preferably thin-skinned, creamy beans like cannellini or great Northern beans)", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing", "3 fresh or dried bay leaves", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and freshly ground pepper", "4 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 cup dry red wine", "1/2 cup halved Castelvetrano olives", "1/2 cup roughly chopped prunes", "1 pound fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and freshly ground pepper", "1 large shallot, minced", "1 teaspoon red wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons chopped capers", "Torn fresh parsley leaves and tender stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start the beans: Rinse the beans then add them to a large, heavy pot and cover with enough cool water to generously immerse (about 12 cups).
