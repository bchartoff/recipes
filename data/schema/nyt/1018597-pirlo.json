{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pirlo", "description": "Like Andrea Pirlo, the celebrated Italian midfielder with whom it shares its name, the drink called Pirlo comes from Brescia, in northern Italy. But I can\u2019t think of an aperitivo hour anywhere where it would not be perfectly at home. My friend Damiano Abeni, also a Brescian, introduced me to the Pirlo in Rome. It\u2019s the easiest thing ever to make: Stripped to its essentials, the drink simply combines Campari with sparkling white Italian wine. But Damiano specifically uses Pignoletto frizzante (\u201cNO PROSECCO allowed,\u201d he wrote to me by email, caps his), and prefers to garnish with half a slice of Sicilian blood orange of the Tarocco variety. He favors 2-3 parts of wine to one part Campari, allowing that one \u201ccan play with the proportions,\u201d and that in warm weather, ice may be added \u2014 but for Damiano, the addition of ice usually means \u201cmore Campari.\u201d Unsurprisingly, he forgoes the club soda \u2014 but you may wish to add some if you like extra fizz (and lower alcohol).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/26/magazine/26drink4/26eat4-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "campari, orange, white wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 18}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 262, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": null, "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "16 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 part Campari", "2-3 parts dry sparkling Italian white wine (preferably Pignoletto frizzante, never prosecco)", "Half an orange slice to garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To a large, balloon-style wineglass, add the Campari and the wine.
