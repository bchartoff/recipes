The cucumber turns nutty in the pan\u2019s brown butter, with a tender exterior that remains crunchy in the middle \u2014 a nice contrast to the silky salmon. Wild salmon, which is costlier than farmed fish, is worth the price for its sweet, smooth texture and brilliant color. Be sure not to overcook the fillets, which should be soft and barely opaque.
