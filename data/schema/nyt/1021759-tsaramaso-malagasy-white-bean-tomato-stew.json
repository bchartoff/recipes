{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tsaramaso Malagasy (White Bean Tomato Stew)", "description": "Jeanne Razanamaria, a cook from Madagascar, transforms three ingredients with some oil and salt into a rich dish that tastes like it has secret seasonings hidden in its depths. Her simple technique of collapsing tomatoes with saut\u00e9ed red onion then simmering both with beans and their cooking liquid concentrates them into a tangy, earthy stew. She shared this recipe with Hawa Hassan for the book \u201cIn Bibi\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d written with Julia Turshen. It works with any dried white bean, large or small, and tastes great on its own or with steamed rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/06/dining/04cookbooksrex-white-beans/merlin_181830831_89593d64-43f8-487a-bac1-6c064744c014-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "african", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, beans, soups and stews, main course, side dish", "keywords": "fall, spring, winter, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, red onion, tomato, white beans", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 270}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound dried white beans, rinsed well and drained (see Tip)", "3 large tomatoes, preferably Roma", "Kosher salt", "1/4 cup canola oil", "1 large red onion, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the beans in a large pot and add enough cold water to cover them by 1 inch.
