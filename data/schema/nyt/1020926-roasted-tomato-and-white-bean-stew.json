{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Tomato and White Bean Stew", "description": "This hearty, flexible stew comes together with pantry ingredients and delivers layers of flavors. Cherry tomatoes, roasted in a generous glug of olive oil to amplify their sweetness, lend a welcome brightness to this otherwise rich dish. Onion, garlic and red-pepper flakes form the backbone of this dish, to which white beans and broth are added, then simmered until thick. While this stew is lovely on its own, you could also add wilt-able greens such as kale, escarole or Swiss chard at the end, and toasted bread crumbs on top. The dish is vegan as written, but should you choose to top your bowl with a showering of grated pecorino or Parmesan, it would most likely work well in your favor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/ch-tomato-white-bean-stew/merlin_170015916_5f8dc24f-2a64-4551-8b7e-f8d7f7506d6c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weeknight, beans, soups and stews, vegetables", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, chicken stock, lemon, parsley, vegetable broth, white beans, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1655}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup roughly chopped Italian parsley leaves and tender stems", "2 teaspoons lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)", "2 (10-ounce) containers cherry or grape tomatoes", "1/4 cup olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons and more for drizzling (optional)", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced", "3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "2 (15-ounce) cans white beans (such as butter or cannellini), rinsed", "1 1/2 cups vegetable or chicken broth, or water", "Flaky salt, for serving (optional)", "Toasted bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
