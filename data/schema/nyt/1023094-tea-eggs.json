Known for their marbled design and savory soy flavor, the eggs are boiled, then cracked and soaked in tea blended with spices. The liquid seeps beneath the cracks to form fine lines all over the eggs while seasoning them. You can also simply marinate them without their shells and end up with a more robust taste. Adjust the seasonings below to your taste, if you like, and then enjoy the eggs on their own with a cup of tea or any way you would enjoy boiled eggs \u2014 in rice bowls, noodles, salads and other vegetable dishes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/13/dining/08korex2-eggs/08korex2-eggs-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT30M", "recipeYield": "12 eggs", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, poultry, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "egg, soy sauce, tea", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 211}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 large eggs", "1/2 cup soy sauce", "2 tablespoons shaoxing wine or dry sherry", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "4 slices peeled fresh ginger", "1 whole star anise", "1 teaspoon whole Sichuan or black peppercorns", "1 teaspoon coarse salt", "3 Chinese tea bags or \u2153 cup loose tea, such as oolong or jasmine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Take the eggs out of the refrigerator to let them warm up a bit.
