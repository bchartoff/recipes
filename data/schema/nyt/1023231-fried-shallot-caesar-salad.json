{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Shallot Caesar Salad", "description": "The dressing here is great on this salad, but it can find a second (and third, and fourth) life in so many other simple meals. Use it as a dip for grilled asparagus and broccolini; slather it on burgers and BLTs; or combine it 50-50 with Greek yogurt and add chopped dill and black pepper to make a fried shallot Ranch dressing for dipping crudit\u00e9s (or chicken wings). Add it to a roast beef sandwich (or just serve it with the roast beef). It\u2019s a great party dip for chips (or anything you\u2019d serve French onion dip with). This recipe calls for making the mayo from scratch, but you can use store-bought mayo as the base to make it even easier.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
