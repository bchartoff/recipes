{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soy-Sauce-Pickled Eggs", "description": "Yusuke Shimoki runs Engawa, a tiny bar in Japan. To accompany his sakes, he occasionally serves soy-sauce-pickled egg yolks, which he cures in a mixture of mirin-sweetened soy sauce and a strip of the dried kelp known as kombu. A recipe for it appeared in The Times in 2015, after Shimoki visited the United States. You can marinate the yolks for as little as 6 hours and as long as a couple of days, but they are perhaps best after 8 or 9 hours, when the yolks become creamy, with a slightly firm skin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/29/magazine/29eat1/29eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H", "recipeYield": "3 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "snack", "keywords": "egg yolks, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 375}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 80, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "2347 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup Japanese soy sauce", "1/4 cup mirin (sweetened Japanese rice wine)", "1 strip kombu, roughly finger-length", "6 fresh egg yolks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine soy sauce, mirin and kombu in a small bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Gently add egg yolks to the soy-sauce mixture, cover and place in refrigerator to cure for six hours, up to two or three days.
