{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kale Tabbouleh", "description": "Here\u2019s the thing about tabbouleh salad: Most of the ones I\u2019ve had invert my preferred proportion of bulgur to parsley. What you usually get is a bowl of tabbouleh studded with bits of parsley. I like a salad that is mostly parsley, studded with grains of tabbouleh.\n\nI pictured a generous ratio of green to tan, but with kale standing in for parsley. It has a hint of parsley\u2019s pleasing bitterness, but is far milder, which means that this tabbouleh salad didn\u2019t have to be just a side dish, one best eaten in small portions. Instead, I could eat a whole bowl of it \u2014 a dream for a raw kale devotee.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/07/dining/07APPE_SPAN/07APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, salads and dressings", "keywords": "bulgur, kale, tomato, fall, halal, kosher, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 302}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 246, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "335 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2/3 cup fine bulgur", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 shallot, finely chopped", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea salt, more as needed", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1 bunch kale, stems removed, leaves finely chopped (5 cups)", "2 large ripe tomatoes, diced (about 2 cups)", "1/2 cup torn mint leaves", "1/2 cup diced radish", "Black pepper, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook bulgur according to package instructions.
