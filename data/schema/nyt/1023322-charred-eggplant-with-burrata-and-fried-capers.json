{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Charred Eggplant With Burrata and Fried Capers", "description": "When summer cooking feels like too much, the simple formula of grilled vegetables served with an herby dressing and a ball of burrata will get you through the season. Here, grilled or seared eggplant is bathed in an herbaceous, lemony caper-infused olive oil for a light dinner or side dish. Salt-packed capers work best, as they are generally larger and have a petal-like shape that opens up when fried, resulting in a crisp shell that is crunchy and salty (but, brined capers work, too). Make sure to dry the capers well before frying to prevent aggressive spitting when they hit hot oil. Fried capers are highly snackable, so consider making a double batch. Serve with bread, flatbread or, for something heartier, pasta.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/14/dining/hm-grilled-eggplant/hm-grilled-eggplant-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, vegetables, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "burrata, capers, eggplant, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 517}, "recipeIngredient": ["Extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup salt-packed or brined capers, rinsed", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds eggplant (about 2 medium or large), trimmed and sliced into \u00bd-inch disks", "1 large handful of parsley, basil or a combination, finely chopped, plus more to serve", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Zest and juice of 1 lemon", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "2 balls burrata (about 1 pound), at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan or skillet, heat \u00bc cup olive oil over medium-high until it shimmers, about 1 minute.
