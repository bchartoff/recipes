{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Chicken Gumbo", "description": "Gumbo is a celebrated Cajun and Creole stew of many variations, often starring meat and seafood, all richly flavored with a toasty roux. The precise origins of the word gumbo are often debated, but it\u2019s likely derived from West African, Central African and Choctaw languages. Okra and roux are fundamental to gumbo; fil\u00e9 powder, or ground sassafras leaves, is sometimes added to help thicken the stew. It is certainly not traditional to make gumbo in a slow cooker, but it works beautifully: Microwaving the roux and precooking the vegetables in a microwave-safe ceramic (check your manual, and never use metal) insert minimizes hands-on time and clean up without sacrificing that deep flavor. This recipe is highly customizable: Add sliced andouille sausage before cooking, or toss in raw shrimp 10 minutes before serving. Use bone-in, skin-on chicken if you prefer, and fresh okra instead of frozen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/07/dining/sdg-slow-cooker-chicken-gumbo/sdg-slow-cooker-chicken-gumbo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H30M", "recipeYield": "5 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "cajun, creole, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, okra, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 527}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup vegetable oil", "8 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "2 celery stalks, finely chopped", "1 white onion, finely chopped", "1 green bell pepper, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt, plus more to taste", "2 fresh or dried bay leaves", "2 teaspoons sweet or hot paprika", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme", "Black pepper", "3 cups chicken stock or broth", "1 1/2 to 1\u00be pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1-pound bag frozen sliced okra (optional)", "Cooked rice, for serving", "Sliced scallions and hot sauce, for topping (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the insert of a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, whisk the flour and oil together until evenly combined.
