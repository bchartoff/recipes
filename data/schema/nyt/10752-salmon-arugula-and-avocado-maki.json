Roll as you advance, keeping the bamboo mat from curling into the roll by pulling it away with one hand. As the roll nears the end, dab some vinegar on the exposed nori edge, so that when the roll is completed, the top edge sticks and seals. Using a clean, sharp knife, slice the roll in half. Then hold the two halves side by side, and trim ends. Make 3 even cuts, cleaning knife after each, to get 8 pieces of sushi. Repeat 5 times with the other nori sheets."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10752-salmon-arugula-and-avocado-maki"}
