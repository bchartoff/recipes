{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon Fried Rice", "description": "It\u2019s always a clever idea to cook extra rice so that you can make fried rice the next night, or the one after that, using various bits and bobs in your fridge. Allowing the rice a day or two to dry out makes it doubly flavorful: Since the grains have less moisture, they\u2019ll absorb even more flavor from whatever liquid you add to them. Plus, the dry grains remain separate, which means more surface area to soak up any seasoning. When it comes to fried rice, anything goes \u2014 leftover meat or fish, or whatever stray vegetables are lurking in your produce drawer or freezer will do. Just make sure you don\u2019t crowd the pan, or your rice will steam instead of crisp.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/05/dining/ss-salmon-fried-rice/merlin_152985264_aba0ad7a-8ed8-4de5-97e6-92fed6effcbd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, grains and rice, seafood", "keywords": "asparagus, broccolini, brown rice, ginger, salmon, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 499}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 549, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1103 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (12-ounce) skinless salmon fillet", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger", "2 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced, whites and greens separated", "1 bunch broccolini (about 8 ounces), trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 bunch thin asparagus (about 1 pound), trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces", "3 cups cooked brown rice (preferably short-grain)", "2 large eggs, beaten", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons dark sesame oil", "Hot sauce or chile-garlic sauce, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice the salmon down the middle lengthwise into 2 pieces.
