{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetarian Mushroom Meatballs With Honey-Ginger Glaze", "description": "These tender, aromatic meatballs are packed with almost a pound of vegetables and a healthy dose of fresh ginger. Rice noodles are the secret to these tender meatballs, keeping them moist while they bake. The shiitake mushrooms provide rich, meaty umami flavor, while the baby bok choy keeps the meatballs delicate and light. These meatballs make a great snack for entertaining, or can form the foundation of dinner when served over brown rice with more steamed bok choy on the side. Leftover meatballs can be frozen and reheated in a 425-degree oven until warmed through, about 15 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/30/dining/kc-vegetarian-meatballs/merlin_168064287_2d5ff0ae-bae9-4b24-87da-ae0624fd5345-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 dozen meatballs", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, finger foods, meatballs, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bok choy, ginger, honey, panko, rice vermicelli, shiitake, soy sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 112}, "recipeIngredient": ["7 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "3 tablespoons honey", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated (about 4 teaspoons)", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/2 ounce dried rice vermicelli noodles, crumbled into small pieces (about 1/4 cup)", "Boiling water, as needed", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "6 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and quartered (about 1 1/2 cups)", "6 ounces baby bok choy, trimmed and chopped into 1-inch pieces (about 2 packed cups)", "2 ounces panko bread crumbs (about 3/4 cup)", "1 large egg", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "Canola oil, for greasing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, combine 6 tablespoons soy sauce with the honey; warm over medium-low heat.
