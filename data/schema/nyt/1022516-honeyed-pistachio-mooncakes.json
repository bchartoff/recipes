{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Honeyed Pistachio Mooncakes", "description": "Mooncakes are pastries timed to the Mid-Autumn Festival, a holiday that celebrates the commencement of the harvest season. Traditionally, they showcased the best ingredients of a region, like sweet lotus seed paste in Guangdong, China, melon seeds in Hainan or pork in Yunnan, but you can stuff mooncakes with whatever you\u2019d like, as long as the fillings are encased in dough and the exterior is aesthetically pleasing. In her forthcoming cookbook, \u201cMooncakes and Milkbread,\u201d the Chinese-American baker Kristina Cho has channeled that spirit by stuffing her mooncakes with blitzed pistachios and honey, a combination commonly found in baklava. The blend is enveloped in a classic Cantonese crust that uses lye water to bump up the pH of the dough, giving it a gentle amber hue, and golden syrup, which lends the cake a chewy, soft bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clarissa Wei"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/08/dining/03MOONCAKEREX1-pistachio-honey-mooncake/merlin_194033367_9230d531-e73c-49ca-b63f-73aa806bfa26-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 small mooncakes", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "cakes, project, dessert", "keywords": "dough, honey, pistachio", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 317}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/300 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/2 cup/110 grams canola oil", "1/2 cup/160 grams golden syrup (such as Lyle\u2019s Golden Syrup)", "1 teaspoon lye water, sometimes known as kansui (see Tip)", "1 large egg", "1 1/2 cups/200 grams roasted unsalted shelled pistachios", "1/4 cup/80 grams honey", "2 tablespoons coconut oil\u00a0", "1 tablespoon cornstarch\u00a0", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, oil, syrup and lye water.

Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and allow the mooncakes to cool completely on the sheet. Before serving, store mooncakes in an airtight container or a resealable bag at room temperature for 1 to 2 days. This step is optional, but the extra time allows the crust to soften and become a little chewier. Mooncakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."}], "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022516-honeyed-pistachio-mooncakes"}
