{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lime, Mint and Rum Tarts", "description": "These small tarts, inspired by a mojito, are the perfect celebratory end to a meal: refreshing, light and boozy. If you don\u2019t have a spice grinder, finely chop the mint for the final step of the curd and then crush it in a pestle and mortar with the rum before adding to the curd. The aim is for the mixture to be as fine as possible, almost like a paste or like pesto, so that it\u2019s fine enough to turn the curd slightly greener, rather than just fleck it with mint. A touch of parsley makes the green even more vibrant. If you want to work ahead, you can make the pastry dough a day in advance. The curd will keep in the fridge for up to a week; the vibrancy of the mint will fade a little, but it will still be fine. Bake the pastry on the day you are serving, though, and serve as soon as possible after the rum is poured over the tart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/08/dining/08BAKING4/08BAKING4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 tarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastries, pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, lime, mint, rum", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 130}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 736, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "75 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "sodiumContent": "199 milligrams", "sugarContent": "42 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/150 grams all-purpose flour (plain flour), more for rolling out dough", "6 tablespoons/80 grams cold unsalted butter, diced", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon/20 grams granulated or superfine sugar (caster sugar)", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon white wine vinegar", "2 tablespoons ice water", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters lime juice (from about 5 to 6 limes), plus the zest of 2 limes, cut in wide strips, avoiding bitter white pith", "2/3 cup/120 grams granulated or superfine sugar (caster sugar)", "1 packed cup/25 grams mint leaves, plus 12 small mint leaves (or regular leaves, shredded just before using) for garnish", "2 tablespoons dark rum, plus 1 tablespoon for serving", "6 parsley leaves", "2 large eggs plus 5 large egg yolks", "2 teaspoons cornstarch (corn flour)", "7 tablespoons/100 grams cold unsalted butter, diced", "1 tablespoon Demerara sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pastry: Place flour, butter, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor.

(If you use a 4-inch cookie cutter, you'll need to roll the dough very thin.) Press down to fill the cups and press the sides so that the pastry rises to the rim of the cup; doing this will help you fill the tarts generously.
