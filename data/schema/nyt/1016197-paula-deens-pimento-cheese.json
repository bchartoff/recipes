The heat from the garlic powder and grated onion cuts through the creaminess of the cheese and mayonnaise, and the pimentos give it an unforgettable punch. Serve it with celery, or spread on your favorite crackers or sandwich bread. It\u2019s a creamy, cheesy crowd-pleaser.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/pimiento-still/pimiento-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, quick, condiments", "keywords": "vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 73}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 257, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "313 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature", "1 cup packed, coarsely grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese", "1 cup packed, coarsely grated Monterey Jack cheese", "1/2 cup mayonnaise, or more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon garlic powder", "3 tablespoons minced pimentos (sweet pickled red or cherry peppers)", "1 teaspoon grated onion", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese until smooth and fluffy.
