With roots in Oaxaca, Mexico, sal de gusano is made from toasted, ground gusano (the moth larvae that feeds on the agave plant), salt and dried chiles, and is traditionally served alongside mezcal. If you\u2019re running low on tequila or mezcal, feel free to use 1 1/2 ounces total of whichever agave-based spirit you have.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/30/dining/24cocktailsrex1/merlin_189797484_15cc1ebf-4733-4a0e-adad-dd95b4313b88-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "mezcal, tequila, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 202}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 ounce mezcal", "3/4 ounce reposado tequila", "3/4 ounce orange liqueur (such as Pierre Ferrand Dry Cura\u00e7ao, Cointreau or triple sec)", "3/4 ounce fresh lime juice", "1/4 ounce <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014441-simple-syrup\">simple syrup</a>", "Ice", "Sal de gusano (worm salt) or kosher salt", "Lime wedge"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the salted half rim, if using: In a small shallow bowl or plate, sprinkle a thin layer of the sal de gusano.
