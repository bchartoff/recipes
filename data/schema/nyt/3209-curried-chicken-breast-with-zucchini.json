{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Curried Chicken Breast With Zucchini", "description": "Here is an unbelievably easy though super flavorful weeknight dish that's bound to become a household favorite. Just toss boneless chicken breasts (chicken thighs would work here, too) and zucchini with curry powder, olive oil, salt and pepper then brown everything over medium heat in a skillet. Empty the pan, then make a quick sauce of shallots, chicken broth, heavy cream, olive oil and butter. Return the chicken and zucchini to the pot and warm through. That's it. Serve it over rice or couscous, or with a side of mashed potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/17/dining/17COOKING-CURRYCHIX-ZUCCHINI1/17COOKING-CURRYCHIX-ZUCCHINI1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight", "keywords": "chicken, curry, zucchini, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 787}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 310, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "588 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Salt to taste if desired", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 zucchini, about 1/2 pound, ends trimmed", "2 teaspoons curry powder", "1 tablespoon butter", "2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots", "1/2 cup chicken broth", "2 tablespoons heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put chicken pieces in a bowl and add 1 tablespoon of the oil, salt and pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim off the ends of the zucchini and cut it into 12 rounds, each about 1/2-inch thick.
