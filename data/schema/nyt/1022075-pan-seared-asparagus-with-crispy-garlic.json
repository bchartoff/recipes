{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Seared Asparagus With Crispy Garlic", "description": "Before asparagus got moved to its own botanical family, Asparagaceae, in the early 2000s, it was part of the lily family along with onions, chives, shallots and garlic. It makes sense then, that asparagus and garlic make such a good duo. When cooked with care, both can be mild and sweet (or pungent and bitter when cooked carelessly). To highlight the best of both ingredients, gently fry garlic into chips for a crispy topping, then use the lightly infused oil to saut\u00e9 the asparagus. Both thin and chubby spears work, as would nearly any other vegetable you like with garlic: broccoli, kale, snap peas, fennel and more.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/01/dining/as-seared-asparagus/merlin_185502606_5f717a8a-3ac3-45c4-8ed3-6b8a7f4e67c0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "asparagus, garlic, olive oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 579}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 bunch asparagus (about 1 pound), ends snapped or trimmed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a paper towel-lined plate next to the stove.
