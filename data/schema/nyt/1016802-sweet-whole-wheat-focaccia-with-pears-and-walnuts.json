There are sweet, nutty and savory flavors at play here, with the rosemary-scented olive oil and pears, and the walnuts tucked into the bread\u2019s dimples.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/16/science/13recipehealthpears/13recipehealthpears-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H50M", "recipeYield": "1 large focaccia, serving 12", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, snack, breads", "keywords": "appetizer, dessert, dairy-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 31}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "288 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon / 4 grams active dry yeast", "1/2 cup / 120 ml lukewarm water", "1 tablespoon / 15 g sugar", "3/4 cup /90 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon / 4 grams active dry yeast", "1 cup / 240 ml lukewarm water", "2 tablespoons / 30 grams sugar", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Scant 3/4 cup / 100 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup / 60 grams fine cornmeal", "2 cups / 250 grams whole wheat flour or durum flour", "1 3/4 teaspoons/ 12 grams fine sea salt", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup / 35 grams chopped walnuts", "1 pound ripe but firm pears, peeled, quartered, cored and sliced in wedges (about 1/2 inch thick at thickest point)", "1 tablespoon / 15 grams sugar", "1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sponge.
