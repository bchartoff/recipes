It\u2019s a perfect holiday cake, or anytime cake, ready to warm you up and get you talking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/04/dining/mp-crunch-cake/merlin_215517648_785ccae8-4c67-48b2-ba34-bade65dbad5a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "14 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "almond, buttermilk, cake flour, sour cream, christmas, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1/4 cup/50 grams plus 2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/35 grams packed sweetened, shredded coconut flakes, toasted and finely crushed in a food processor, plus \u00bc cup left whole for optional topping", "3 cups/384 grams cake flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup/226 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/4 cup/60 grams sour cream or cream cheese, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon almond extract", "1 teaspoon lime juice", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature", "1/4 cup/62 grams unsalted butter", "4 cups/408 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "6 to 8 tablespoons whole milk", "2 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "1/2 teaspoon lime juice", "Chopped almonds (optional), toasted, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
