{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Scallops With Glazed Brussels Sprouts", "description": "The hidden gem in this meal for two is the bacon that starts it all off. It\u2019s crisped in a little olive oil, creating a nice pool of fat to cook both the scallops and the brussels sprouts. When searing scallops, the trick to a great crust and tender insides is to cook them mostly on the first side. A tangy mix of lime juice, maple syrup and Dijon is then splashed in to deglaze the pan, making it easy to scrape up the tasty bits stuck on the bottom. Cold butter is vigorously stirred into the glaze to transform it into a pan sauce. But, draped in that sour-sweet lime butter, it\u2019s the bacon that sings.
