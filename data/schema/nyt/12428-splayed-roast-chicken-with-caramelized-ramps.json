{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Splayed Roast Chicken With Caramelized Ramps", "description": "It may not seem possible to improve on roast chicken cooked in a very hot cast-iron skillet, an easy method that yields a moist, evenly cooked bird. (The thighs, which needs more cooking time, are pressed against the pan, which allows them to cook as quickly as the breast meat.) But here\u2019s a recipe with a clever tweak on that method, one that\u2019s easier than spatchcocking (or butterflying) the chicken, and that makes for a even faster-cooked, juicier bird. Preheat the skillet in a 500-degree oven for about 45 minutes, letting it get blisteringly hot. Meanwhile, take the chicken and snip the skin that connects the legs to the body, splaying the legs open until you feel the joints pop on both sides. Very carefully transfer the chicken to the pan, pressing the legs down into the surface. Ramps, garlic and capers tossed into the pan juices toward the end of the roasting time make for a bright, sweet and salty sauce. A cast-iron skillet is a must here, and if you don\u2019t have one, it\u2019s a worthwhile, and inexpensive, investment.
