Just toss four frozen bananas into a blender and give it a good whirl. If you like soft-serve consistency, eat it right away (and adding a few tablespoons of milk to the blender wouldn't hurt, but it's not necessary). For more traditional scoops, freeze it in an airtight container, and dole out as you would the Ben & Jerry's. Consider adding a spoonful of peanut butter, Nutella or honey; a handful of chocolate chips or almonds; or a 1/2 teaspoon of powdered ginger, cardamom or cinnamon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/24/dining/24COOKING-BANANA-ICE-CREAM1/24COOKING-BANANA-ICE-CREAM1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H10M", "recipeYield": "Four servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "banana, dairy-free, gluten-free, low-fat, vegan, vegetarian, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1101}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 103, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1 milligram", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ripe bananas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the bananas, cut them in 2- to 3-inch chunks and place them in a freezer bag in the freezer for at least 6 hours.
