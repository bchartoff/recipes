{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Savory Mixed-Nut Shortbread", "description": "Inspired by the cocktail nuts served at Union Square Cafe in New York City \u2014 butter-rich, toasty warm and fragrant with rosemary and cayenne \u2014 this no-mixer press-in cookie is a joy to make. You simply melt butter with rosemary and black pepper, stir that into dry ingredients, and then press the dough into a pan. Salted nuts and more fresh rosemary go on top before the whole thing is baked and broken into ragged pieces. Persnickety cookie, this is not. Enjoy on a cheese board, with cocktails or after dinner with tea and dark chocolate. Or pack these in a cellophane bag and tie it with a bow to share as a gift. (The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08COOKIESREX1-NUT-SHORTBREAD/merlin_198252024_2c272bd1-907d-426d-b093-426579b5646c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13 pan (About 8 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "appetizer, dessert", "keywords": "cayenne pepper, christmas cookie, nuts, rosemary, christmas", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 352}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/227 grams salted butter", "1 rosemary sprig, plus 2 tablespoons leaves", "3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "2 1/2 cups/300 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/132 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1 1/2 cups/115 grams mixed, salted nuts (avoid peanuts if possible), lightly crushed with a heavy skillet or mallet"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
