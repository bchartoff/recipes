{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Buttered Stuffing With Celery and Leeks", "description": "Those of you who love stuffing know that it might be the only reason to host Thanksgiving. This version is an updated classic \u2014 no dried fruit, no surprise ingredients, no \u201ctwists\u201d \u2014 just a very buttery, deeply savory stuffing made with garlic, leeks and a lot of celery. The bread is crusty and torn, never cubed (for those crisp, craggy edges), and the whole thing is baked in a baking dish, never inside the turkey (to keep it light and fluffy with a custardy interior and a golden-brown top). All stuffing needs two trips to the oven: once, covered, to cook it through and twice, uncovered, to crisp up the top. You can do the first bake ahead of time if you like, or do one after the other if the timing works out that way.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/13/dining/11Romanrex1/11Romanrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, stuffing and dressing", "keywords": "bread, celery, dry white wine, leek, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1234}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large loaf good, crusty bread, preferably sourdough or ciabatta (about 1\u00bc pounds)", "1/4 cup olive oil", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter", "6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "2 large leeks, white and light green parts, chopped", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "6 celery stalks, thinly sliced, leaves reserved for garnish if available", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken, turkey or vegetable broth", "3 large eggs", "1/2 cup finely chopped parsley", "1/4 cup finely chopped chives", "2 tablespoons finely chopped marjoram, oregano or thyme"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using your hands, tear bread, crust and all, into 1 1/2- to 2-inch pieces.
