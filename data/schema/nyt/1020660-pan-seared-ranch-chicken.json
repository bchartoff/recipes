But don\u2019t reach for bottled ranch. Instead, make your own brighter, tangier version using Greek yogurt. Unlike lemon or vinegar-based marinades, which can toughen meat, yogurt tenderizes even the leanest of chicken breasts. When the chicken is seared in a hot pan, the yogurt-mayo coating forms a flavorful, caramelized crust. (It also makes an excellent marinade for fish, pork, shrimp or sturdy vegetables.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/21/dining/as-ranch-chicken/as-ranch-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, chicken breast, chives, dill, garlic, greek yogurt, mayonnaise, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 202}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup Greek yogurt", "1/4 cup mayonnaise", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives, or 1/2 teaspoon dried, plus more for serving", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill or parsley (or 1/2 teaspoon dried), plus more for serving", "3/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a measuring cup or small bowl, stir together the yogurt, mayonnaise, chives, dill and garlic powder; season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper.
