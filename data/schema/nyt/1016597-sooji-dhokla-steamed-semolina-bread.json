{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sooji Dhokla (Steamed Semolina Bread)", "description": "Dhokla is an irresistible Guajarati Indian snack that is essentially a fluffy, steamed savory bread or cake. They are often made with chana dal, ground chickpeas. But there are dhoklas made with other dried legumes, with rice and with corn, even with semolina (sooji), as in this version. Dhokla has a marvelous light, spongy texture. The batter is spicy with ginger and green chile; more flavors are added by popping mustard seed and curry leaves in oil for the final flourish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/25/dining/25KITCH1/25KITCH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 8-inch dhokla, 6 to 8 servings (about 24 small squares)", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, coconut, ginger", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 21}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 161, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "362 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons/30 milliliters vegetable oil, such as untoasted sesame or grapeseed oil, plus more for greasing pan", "One-inch piece peeled ginger, finely chopped", "1 or 2 small green chiles, chopped", "3/4 teaspoon/6 grams kosher salt, plus a pinch", "1 cup/160 grams fine semolina", "1 teaspoon/8 grams baking soda", "1 teaspoon/8 grams baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon turmeric", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters plain whole milk yogurt", "1 handful fluffy cilantro sprigs, for garnish", "1/4 cup/30 grams freshly grated coconut (or use frozen shredded coconut, defrosted), for garnish", "Minty yogurt chutney, for serving (see recipe)", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters vegetable oil", "2 or 3 small green chiles, slit lengthwise", "1 teaspoon/10 grams black mustard seeds", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds", "8 to 10 fresh curry leaves", "Pinch of asafetida, a.k.a. hing (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set up a steamer large enough to hold an 8-inch cake pan on a rack, with sufficient room above and below.
