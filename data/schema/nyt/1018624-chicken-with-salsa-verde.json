{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken With Salsa Verde", "description": "Though there are a lot of ingredients in this recipe, it's a straightforward chicken saute-and-sauce combination. Brown the chicken -- dark meat is preferable -- then lightly brown the seeds, then soften the vegetables. The tomatillos, if canned, provide enough liquid; if you're using fresh tomatillos you might need to add a little water or stock, but not much. The chicken simmers in the sauce, and lime juice completes the picture. This is traditionally served with a host of garnishes, which I see as optional but fulfilling.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/03/12/dining/chicken-with-salsa-verde/chicken-with-salsa-verde-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, lard, poblano, serrano, tomatillo, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 52}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 352, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "529 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons lard or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn", "4 chicken leg-thigh pieces, each cut in two (or use 8 thighs)", "Salt and pepper", "1 1/2 cups pepitas (green squash seeds)", "1 large onion, chopped", "4 cloves garlic, chopped", "4 medium poblano or other mild green fresh chiles, diced, stemmed, seeded and chopped", "2 Serrano, jalape\u00f1o or other hot green fresh chiles, stemmed, seeded and minced, optional", "1 pound tomatillos (16 to 20), husked and rinsed (canned are O.K.; include their juices)", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "1/4 cup chopped parsley", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano or marjoram leaves", "Lime juice to taste", "Optional garnishes: diced avocado; sliced scallions, radishes, cabbage; lime wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put lard or oil in a large, deep skillet or casserole that can later be covered.
