Today, it\u2019s a popular street food across Germany, although how you enjoy it depends on the vendor and your preferences: The sausages can be served with or without skin, and you can request your currywurst sauce to be scharf (hot) or even extra-scharf. In traditional German currywurst sauces, tomatoes and vinegar provide acidity, sugar or juice lend sweetness and mild curry powder adds spice (although some adventurous cooks add other aromatics and spices, like mustard powder, hot chile or even lemongrass). This recipe, adapted from Alfons Schuhbeck's \u201cThe German Cookbook\u201d (Phaidon, 2018), is a great introduction, not too spiced or too sweet, and can be customized according to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/dining/aw-currywurst/merlin_161590545_8a14d4ba-159d-43dc-b7b3-e0d2de7c3afc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "german", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, sausages", "keywords": "chiles de \u00e1rbol, cinnamon, curry powder, paprika, sausage, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons olive oil", "1 small yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon mild curry powder, plus more for sprinkling", "1 teaspoon ground sweet paprika", "1 (2-inch) cinnamon stick", "1 small dried chile de \u00e1rbol", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes with their juices", "3/4 cup vegetable stock", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar", "Kosher salt, to taste", "6 to 8 fresh bratwurst sausages, knockwurst sausages or hot dogs", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable", "French fries, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the currywurst ketchup: In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium.
