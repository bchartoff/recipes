{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coleslaw", "description": "This classic version of coleslaw is also the simplest, with a light, creamy, tangy-sweet dressing spiked with celery seeds. For the best result, make the coleslaw a few hours ahead and refrigerate it to allow all the flavors to marry and soak into the cabbage. Celery seeds add strong, aromatic, grassy notes, but simply skip them if they\u2019re unavailable. For extra flair, you could add \u00bd cup of your favorite chopped fresh herb, such as parsley, tarragon or dill. Leftovers make a great topping for tacos, hot dogs, sliders and sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/27/dining/kc-coleslaw/merlin_209008497_9bd7fde5-16fb-4076-99db-2ff56d52dbd2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings, side dish", "keywords": "cabbage, celery seeds, mayonnaise, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 330}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup mayonnaise", "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon celery seeds", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 medium head green cabbage (about 2 pounds)", "1/2 medium head purple cabbage (about 1 pound)", "2 carrots, grated on the large holes of a box grater"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a very large bowl, combine mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar and celery seeds.
