Along with molasses, it makes the gingerbread moist, flavorful and a good keeper. The cake\u2019s got a mix of traditional spices \u2014 ground ginger, cinnamon and cloves \u2014 as well as crystallized ginger, which has a soft, chewy texture and adds a bit of heat. If your ginger is hard, steep it in hot water for 30 seconds, drain and pat it dry. The gingerbread is sweet, but not very, so it\u2019s as good with ricotta, yogurt, a swish of cream cheese or even a slice of Cheddar as it is with whipped cream, ice cream or hot fudge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/14/multimedia/09CAKESREX1-gingerbread-1-b665/12CAKES-REX1-gingerbread-1-b665-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 to 16 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "buttermilk, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, make-ahead, molasses, christmas, thanksgiving, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 401}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick baker\u2019s spray or cooking spray, for the pan", "2 1/4 cups/288 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/60 grams whole wheat flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "2 teaspoons ground ginger", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves\u00a0", "2/3 cup/135 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/75 grams packed brown sugar (light or dark)", "5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters neutral oil", "1 large egg, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters unsulfured molasses", "3/4 cup/160 milliliters apple butter", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature", "1/3 cup/45 grams finely chopped crystallized ginger (see Tip)\u00a0", "2 tablespoons sanding sugar, for topping (optional)", "3 tablespoons Swedish pearl sugar, for topping (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
