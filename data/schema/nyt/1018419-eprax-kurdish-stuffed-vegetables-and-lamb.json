{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eprax (Kurdish Stuffed Vegetables and Lamb)", "description": "This recipe for eprax, a multilayered casserole of Kurdish-style stuffed vegetables and lamb chops, comes from Parwin Tayyar in Nashville. To make the dish, sometimes called dolmas, Ms. Tayyar prepares a gently spiced lamb and rice filling, and uses it to stuff a mixture of vegetables, such as squash, tomatoes, potatoes and cabbage. Carefully layered in a pot with a little liquid, the vegetables simmer and steam together on the stove until they're tender. Then the whole dish is tipped out into a messy, delicious pile to be eaten with flatbread, pickles, hummus or a cucumber sauce. It may seem like a complex process, but once all the vegetables are prepped and the filling is ready, things go quickly. The dish is flexible, and what Ms. Tayyar provides is a blueprint: You can stuff any vegetables you have on hand, as long as you remember to stuff them loosely.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/dining/COOKING-EPRAX1/COOKING-IRAQI1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "4 main course servings, up to 10 as part of a larger meal", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, project", "keywords": "bell pepper, cabbage, grape leaves, lamb, onion, rice, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 22}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups Basmati rice", "1 pound ground lamb or beef", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "2 teaspoons black pepper", "2 tablespoons minced garlic", "2 tablespoons minced yellow onion", "1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste", "1 cup diced celery", "1 small tomato, diced", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 tablespoon garam masala", "2 teaspoons paprika", "2 teaspoons curry powder", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 tablespoon fresh finely chopped parsley", "1 large yellow onion, trimmed and peeled", "1 (3-pound) head green cabbage", "20 roughly hand-size grape leaves (from an 8-ounce jar)", "2 bell peppers or large tomatoes, or a combination", "1 large eggplant", "1 russet potato", "4 (3/4-inch-thick) lamb loin chops", "Salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil", "1/2 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch-thick half-moons or semicircles", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 Kurdish flatbread or 4 Indian naan, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the filling: Rinse rice in colander until water runs clear.
