{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Mushroom Skewers in Red Chile Paste", "description": "Fire up the grill and let the aromas of vegetables and chile-marinated mushrooms charred over an open flame permeate the neighborhood. This simple recipe is fun to assemble, and a crowd pleaser, making it ideal for cookouts. Meaty king oyster mushrooms are smothered in a guajillo chile sauce that includes earthy achiote, which stains the mushrooms red. Liquid aminos or soy sauce add saltiness and umami, and maple syrup brings a touch of sweetness. If you don\u2019t have the vegetables below on hand, you can easily swap them out for others that will cook in the same time frame. Serve this as a main dish with your favorite cooked grains or salad, or as a side dish to just about anything.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/01/dining/jr-mushroom-skewers/merlin_188546361_d3a9ab60-84d2-458c-b260-80b18c4e9d51-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, guajillo chiles, mushroom, zucchini, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 231}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 bamboo skewers (each about 8 inches long)", "4 medium guajillo chiles, stemmed, seeded and rinsed", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "Salt and black pepper", "2 large yellow or orange bell peppers, cut into 1-inch dice", "2 large zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch-thick coins", "10 ounces cherry tomatoes (about 20)", "1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon neutral-flavored oil, plus more if needed", "1 tablespoon achiote paste (see Tip)", "1 tablespoon liquid aminos or soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure maple syrup", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "12 ounces king oyster mushrooms (about 10)", "1 lemon, halved", "Flaky sea salt, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If cooking outdoors, prepare a charcoal grill or heat a gas grill to medium-high.
