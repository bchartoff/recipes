{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ginger-Garlic Shrimp With Coconut Milk", "description": "Fresh ingredients and bold condiments do the heavy lifting here, creating a fragrant 20-minute meal that will lure people into the kitchen, wondering what smells so good. Inspired by elements of Indian and Thai curries, the shrimp are coated in ginger, garlic and turmeric, then seared and braised in a combination of coconut milk and soy sauce. Spinach is stirred in for a bit of green, but you can substitute your favorite quick-cooking greens like bok choy or kale and adjust cooking time as needed. Swap the shrimp for scallops or white fish, if you like. Serve with rice, rice vermicelli noodles or naan to soak up the flavorful liquid.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/18/dining/yf-Ginger-Garlic-Shrimp-With-Coconut-Milk/merlin_206514630_4489625f-106e-4a13-869f-6ff3ea8b3524-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "coconut milk, shrimp, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1635}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large garlic cloves, minced or grated", "1 teaspoon minced or grated ginger", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails on or off", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "3 packed cups baby spinach", "1 lime, halved", "1 fresno, jalape\u00f1o or serrano chile, thinly sliced", "2 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced", "1/2 packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped", "Steamed rice, vermicelli noodles or naan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a mixing bowl, mix together the garlic, ginger, turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt, \u00bd teaspoon pepper and the olive oil.
