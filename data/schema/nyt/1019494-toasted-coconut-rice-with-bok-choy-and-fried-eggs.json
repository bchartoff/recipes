{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Toasted Coconut Rice With Bok Choy and Fried Eggs", "description": "Coconut oil toasts rice grains, lightly coats vegetables, and sizzles eggs in this dish, lending its unique tropical taste and richness. You get an extra dose of richness if you leave the egg yolks runny and cut and swirl them into the rice and greens mixture. If you\u2019re vegan, you can fry tofu or tempeh in the coconut oil instead. If you\u2019re gluten-free, you can use tamari in place of the soy sauce. Here, too, feel free to use prepackaged, trimmed haricots verts if you're short on time, or wax beans, in place of the green beans.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/17/dining/coconut-rice/coconut-rice-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, weeknight, grains and rice", "keywords": "bok choy, green beans, jasmine rice, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 196}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 183, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "569 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large eggs", "3 tablespoons coconut oil", "2 cups jasmine or other medium-grain rice (12 ounces), rinsed and drained", "Kosher salt", "8 ounces bok choy", "6 ounces green beans", "Toasted sesame seeds, soy sauce and Sriracha, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Take your eggs out of the fridge so they won\u2019t be ice-cold when you fry them."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high heat.
