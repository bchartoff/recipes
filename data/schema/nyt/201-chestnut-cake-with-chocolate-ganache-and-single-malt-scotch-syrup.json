The milk chocolate ganache tempers the Scotch and mellows the chestnuts, and brings the whole dessert together harmoniously. The cake itself is almost a meringue. Use your best single-malt for this \u2014 a lesser one will make for a good but not great result.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Bill Yosses"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 501, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "91 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "65 milligrams", "sugarContent": "55 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup confectioners' sugar, more for serving", "1 cup almond flour (see note)", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup chestnut flour (see note)", "8 large egg whites", "Pinch cream of tartar", "1 cup lightly packed light brown sugar, sifted", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/4 cup aged single-malt Scotch whiskey", "1 cup walnut halves", "1 15-ounce jar chestnuts packed in syrup, drained (see note)", "Milk chocolate ganache (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/202-milk-chocolate-ganache\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
