They\u2019ll almost remind you of a jelly doughnut, even more so if you use brioche hamburger buns as your bread of choice. (But regular white sandwich bread, challah or any other enriched bread works, too.) You can adjust the sugar in the berries, depending on how sweet they are, and, if you prefer a smoother compote, press the cooked fruit through a mesh sieve once cooled to remove any seeds.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/03/dining/jg-blackberry-stuffed-french-toast/merlin_174838329_cefa524c-d2dd-4571-8714-aa60f4bb1ec7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, main course", "keywords": "blackberry, brioche, french toast, milk, rum, sugar, father\u2019s day, mother\u2019s day, valentine\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 246}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pint/285 grams fresh or frozen blackberries, raspberries or blueberries (about 2 heaping cups)", "1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "Kosher salt", "3 large eggs", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whole milk", "1 to 2 tablespoons dark rum, bourbon or brandy", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "8 slices brioche or white sandwich bread (each about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick)", "Unsalted butter, for frying", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the berries, 1/3 cup/70 grams granulated sugar, the lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan.
