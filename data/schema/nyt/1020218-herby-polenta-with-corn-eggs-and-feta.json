{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herby Polenta With Corn, Eggs and Feta", "description": "Cooking polenta in the oven has turned out to be quite a game-changer for me, and completely contradicts the belief that polenta needs to consistently be attended to. Do try to find coarse cornmeal here rather than the quick-cooking kind, as that style of polenta simply won\u2019t yield the same smooth and creamy result that you\u2019re looking for. You can also swap out the chicken stock for vegetable stock or water if you\u2019re looking for a vegetarian alternative. I like to serve this as a midday brunch with a zesty green salad, as it\u2019s hearty enough to keep you going until dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/29/dining/28ottorex/merlin_154779477_40a4bb19-c6f1-4cf6-9fdd-648e194154b3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "casseroles, grains and rice", "keywords": "cilantro, corn, cornmeal, eggs, feta, polenta, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 563}, "recipeIngredient": ["9 ounces/255 grams frozen corn kernels (about 2 cups), defrosted", "7 ounces/200 grams baby spinach (about 10 lightly packed cups), roughly torn or sliced", "1 cup/150 grams coarse cornmeal", "1 packed cup/50 grams finely grated Parmesan", "5 scallions (spring onions), thinly sliced, 2 tablespoons reserved for garnish", "1/4 cup/20 grams roughly chopped fresh cilantro (coriander), plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped and reserved for garnish", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh dill", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "Salt and black pepper", "2 1/4 cups/530 milliliters whole milk", "2 cups/475 milliliters chicken stock", "3 tablespoons/40 grams unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "5 ounces/140 grams Greek feta, roughly crumbled (about 1 cup)", "8 medium eggs, at room temperature", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit/200 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the corn to a food processor and pulse once or twice, just until roughly chopped.
