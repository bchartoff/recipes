{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pad See Ew", "description": "Built around the satisfying umami of soy sauce, this is an easy Thai recipe to shop for and cook at home. The classic version is made with wide, fresh rice noodles, but Pailin Chongchitnant, a popular Canadian YouTube chef, said that restaurants in Bangkok proudly advertise using spaghetti; in southern Thailand, her family used egg noodles. (In other words, there\u2019s flexibility.) The street-kitchen version of this popular dish \u2014 a close relative of Cantonese beef chow fun \u2014 will always have more of the seared edges that make the dish extra delicious, but cooking it in a wide, heavy pan that holds onto heat gives great results. If gai lan is not available, Ms. Chongchitnant says that broccolini, a hybrid of gai lan and broccoli, or steamed broccoli are good alternatives. (The crunch of the stems is what you\u2019re after here.).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/23/dining/17padthairex2/merlin_203116089_36c661da-aef9-4bb3-a693-0701375b2160-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "noodles, main course", "keywords": "beef, chinese broccoli, rice noodles", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 904}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces sen yai or other dried wide rice noodles", "8 ounces beef, chicken or pork, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "6 gai lan (Chinese broccoli) or broccolini, thick stems trimmed off, or steamed broccoli, cut into 2-inch-long pieces with stems attached", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for cooking eggs", "Thai black soy sauce or Chinese dark soy sauce, to taste", "2 tablespoons oyster sauce", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon fish sauce", "1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the noodles: Place dried noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot tap water.
