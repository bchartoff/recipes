{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fig-Olive Tapenade With Prosciutto and Persimmon", "description": "Adding chopped dried figs to tapenade lends a fruity note that contrasts with the briny Kalamata olives in this thick, garlic-spiked spread. Here, it\u2019s served alongside silky slices of prosciutto and juicy persimmon to echo and round out those sweet-salty flavors. If you\u2019re starting with soft, plump dried figs, you don\u2019t need to soak them first. Just chop them up and add to the food processor with the olives. Leftover tapenade will keep for at least a week or two in the fridge, and makes a terrific condiment for sandwiches, or serve it with roasted chicken or meats.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/23/dining/18apperex2-tapenade/18apperex2-tapenade-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, dried figs, kalamata olives, rosemary, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 381}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup dried figs, stems trimmed", "1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives", "2 anchovy fillets", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, more to taste", "1 small garlic clove, coarsely chopped", "3/4 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more if needed", "Prosciutto, for serving", "Persimmon wedges, for serving", "Toasted country bread, crackers or breadsticks, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place figs in a bowl and cover with boiling water.
