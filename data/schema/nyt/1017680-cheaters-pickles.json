Fresh herbs other than dill, like basil or a bit of mint or chive, can be used. A few slivers of sweet onion are nice, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/02/dining/02DORAWEB7/02DORAWEB7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pickles", "keywords": "champagne vinegar, dill, rice vinegar, vidalia onion, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 116}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 25, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "184 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 English cucumbers", "2 tablespoons sugar", "Handful of ice cubes", "1/4 cup rice vinegar, Champagne vinegar, apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar", "Several pinches of flaky salt, such as Maldon", "Several grinds of black pepper, optional", "2 tablespoons snipped fresh dill, mint or chives, or a mixture, optional", "1/2 Vidalia onion, sliced into thin half-moons, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut off the ends of the cucumbers and use the tines of a fork to draw long stripes down their lengths.
