{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pesto and Mozzarella French Bread Pizza", "description": "Basil is the classic choice for this alternative to red sauce, but blend in any tender, flavorful herbs or greens like parsley, spinach, or arugula depending on what you have around. This pesto recipe doubles easily and freezes well, too: Transfer the finished pesto to an ice cube tray and freeze until firm. Pop the frozen pesto into a resealable bag, and keep it in the freezer for up to three months. Defrost whenever a pasta or pizza craving calls, though you can certainly use store-bought pesto to make things even easier. Fresh mozzarella creates excellent cheese pulls, but feel free to play around with other soft cheeses: A crumbling of feta or goat cheese would make delicious variations.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/19/dining/14FRENCHBREADREX2/merlin_200287170_96ebaea8-7557-4df6-b139-5dd77a1f5302-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pizza and calzones", "keywords": "basil, french bread, mozzarella, pine nuts", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 308}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups lightly packed basil leaves or other tender herbs or greens such as parsley, arugula, baby spinach, or a combination", "1 garlic clove", "1/4 cup pine nuts or almonds", "1/3 cup olive oil", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "1 loaf soft French bread, split lengthwise, insides mostly dug out", "8 ounces mozzarella, low-moisture and part-skim, or fresh (drained and patted dry, if necessary) thinly sliced", "Red-pepper flakes, dried oregano or grated Parmesan, or a combination, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pesto: Heat the oven to 450 degrees with a rack in the middle position.
