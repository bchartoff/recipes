Oranges are not only a great source of vitamin C; they\u2019re packed with other phytochemicals called limonoids that are being studied for their anti-inflammatory, immune-boosting and cholesterol-lowering properties. If you can find blood oranges, you\u2019ll get the added benefits of the anthocyanins in the red pigment.
