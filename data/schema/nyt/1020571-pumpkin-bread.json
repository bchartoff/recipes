{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pumpkin Bread", "description": "Moist and tender, delicately flavored with pumpkin and cinnamon, this humble loaf needs no bells and whistles. If you want to go big, throw in more spices, like nutmeg and cloves, a hearty handful of chopped bittersweet chocolate or a tablespoon of orange zest. Stir in some chopped walnuts or pecans for added crunch, or scatter some pepitas or crushed gingersnaps over the top. My favorite adornment is a simple cream cheese glaze. Mix together four ounces of cream cheese, a couple tablespoons of warm milk, a tablespoon of confectioners\u2019 sugar and a pinch of salt. Drizzle it over the cooled loaf.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/dining/ss-pumpkin-bread/ss-pumpkin-bread-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "1 loaf (about 10 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, breads, cakes, quick breads", "keywords": "brown sugar, pumpkin, sour cream, dessert, side dish, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 421}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/120 milliliters vegetable oil, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 1/4 cups/285 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 (15-ounce) can ((about 2 cups)\u00a0pumpkin pur\u00e9e\u00a0", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 cup/165 grams packed light or dark brown sugar", "2 large eggs", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters full-fat sour cream or plain yogurt", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
