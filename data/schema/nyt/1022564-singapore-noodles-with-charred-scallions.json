{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Singapore Noodles With Charred Scallions", "description": "While this dish is named for Singapore, it was not created there. Many believe it was invented in Hong Kong, in the 1950s or 1960s, by chefs seeking to add a different flavor profile to Cantonese dishes. It is now a much loved dish at cha chaan tengs, a type of cafe in Hong Kong, and at Cantonese eateries across the world. The original features meat, eggs and vegetables, but this vegetarian version showcases charred scallions, which add sweetness. Peppers are often included, but you could use carrots, cabbage, cauliflower or any thinly sliced vegetable that can be cooked in 3 to 4 minutes. The technique of \u201cblooming\u201d the curry powder in the oil ensures that the vermicelli is silky rather than gritty. Use a curry powder that has turmeric listed as one of the first ingredients, as it lends a lovely golden color to the noodles. (You can add \u00bd teaspoon of turmeric powder to a commercial curry powder if you want to ensure a bright hue.)\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/28/dining/HM-Singapore-Noodles-With-Charred-Scallions-reshoot/merlin_195007206_7e39cbe3-a322-4b76-a7e2-c7acad701b90-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "noodles", "keywords": "egg, scallion, turmeric, vermicelli, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1036}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 eggs, lightly beaten", "Kosher salt", "Neutral oil, such as vegetable or grapeseed", "1 bunch scallions (about 8 to 10)", "2 bell peppers (any color), cut lengthwise into \u00bc-inch slices", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon curry powder", "10 ounces rice vermicelli, soaked in warm water for 5 to 10 minutes and drained", "2 tablespoon soy sauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season eggs with \u00bd teaspoon of kosher salt, and whisk well."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large (12-inch) skillet or wok over medium-high, and, once hot, swirl the oil around and pour in the egg mixture.
