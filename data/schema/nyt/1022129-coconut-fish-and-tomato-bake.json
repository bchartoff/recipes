Accompanying the fish are bright bursts of tomatoes which turn jammy under the broiler and relinquish some of their juices to the pan sauce. This sauce is silky enough to coat a spoon and packed with flavor. It pairs well with anything from snapper to flounder and even salmon, so choose the fillets that look best at the market. You\u2019ll want to sop up the sauce with thick slices of grilled or toasted baguette, or spoon it over steamed rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/28/dining/coconutfishrex/merlin_186997626_6bf4dc0b-2582-406b-b4ca-8a64ca49c825-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, seafood, main course", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, coconut milk, fish, sheet-pan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3168}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk", "1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, scrubbed and finely grated", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 tablespoon honey", "Kosher salt", "2 limes", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "4 (6-ounce) fish fillets, such as snapper, haddock, striped bass, fluke, sablefish or salmon, skin on or off", "2 pints cherry or grape tomatoes", "3 tablespoons olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, ginger, garlic, turmeric, red-pepper flakes, honey and 1 teaspoon salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Zest and juice 1 lime directly into the coconut milk mixture.
