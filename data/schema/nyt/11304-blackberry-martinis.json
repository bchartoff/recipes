The original recipe, from ''The Berry Bible,'' suggests vodka, but I find the complexity of the drink enhanced by the gin's juniper-berry accent. I think vodka is dull, actually, but if you like it (most of America seems to), go with God.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jonathan Reynolds"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/23/dining/Blackberry-Martinis/Blackberry-Martinis-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "4 martinis", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "blackberries, gin, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 43}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 482, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "75 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "5 milligrams", "sugarContent": "69 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar", "2 cups blackberries", "1/4 cup berry brandy or cr\u00e8me de cassis", "4 lemon wedges", "Superfine sugar", "1 cup gin (or vodka)", "2 tablespoons Triple Sec", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of the sugar and 1 cup water.
