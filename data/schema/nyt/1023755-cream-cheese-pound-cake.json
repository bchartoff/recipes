For a Barbie-pink dream house finish, prepare this with the optional toppings: raspberry preserves, gently salted whipped cream and a snowy, psychedelic blanket of freeze-dried raspberries. Any toppings should be added right before serving, but if it\u2019s simplicity you\u2019re after, then you can skip them and dust the cake with confectioners\u2019 sugar or nothing at all. The cake, undressed, will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 to 4 days or well-wrapped in the freezer for up to a month.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/28/multimedia/21RISOTTOREX2-cream-cheese-pound-cake-1-53a0/22RISOTTOREX2-cream-cheese-pound-cake-1-53a0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "One 9-by-13-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "christmas, new year\u2019s day, cream cheese, freezer friendly, make-ahead, pound cake", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 340}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups/320 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 1/2 cups/345 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature", "8 ounces/226 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "3 cups/600 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea salt", "5 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup/305 grams raspberry preserves (see Tip)", "2 cups/473 milliliters cold heavy whipping cream", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 1/2 cups/34 grams freeze-dried raspberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 325 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, add the flour and baking powder.
