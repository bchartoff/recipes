{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blueberry Pie", "description": "Perfection is a fool\u2019s mission when it comes to blueberry pie. Sometimes the filling is a little runny. Other times, slightly thick, depending on the blueberries themselves. But this recipe helps even the odds, with the use of arrowroot starch in place of the more typical flour or cornstarch, and an awesome pre-thickening technique picked up from the pastry chef Kierin Baldwin. You could use a different pie crust, but I like the all-butter version below, at least with a pre-baked bottom and an artfully cut top that allows steam to escape.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/06/dining/ss-blueberry-pie/ss-blueberry-pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "arrowroot flour, blueberry, butter, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 403}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups or 300 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon or 3 grams kosher salt", "1 1/4 cups or 285 grams unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes", "8 to 10 tablespoons or 120 to 150 grams of ice water", "1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of water", "8 cups or 1.2 kilograms blueberries, picked over and washed", "1/2 cup or 140 grams raw sugar", "2 tablespoons or 30 grams lemon juice", "2 to 3 tablespoons or 16 to 24 grams arrowroot flour or cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon or 1.5 grams kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the crust, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl or food processor.
