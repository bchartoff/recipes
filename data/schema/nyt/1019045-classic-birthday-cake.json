{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Birthday Cake", "description": "A birthday cake needn't be elaborate. A few layers of tender yellow cake and creamy chocolate frosting will do the trick. In this version of the classic pairing, brown sugar and buttermilk provide a sophisticated flavor to the cake, and sour cream adds a slight tang to the chocolate frosting. It\u2019s worth noting that both the cake and frosting can be made ahead. Just make sure you bring the frosting to room temperature before assembly so that it spreads easily. One note: The buttermilk and brown sugar in the batter means that the cake might appear slightly darker on the outside after baking than your typical yellow cake, but don't worry. The inside will be tender and moist.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/30/dining/30COOKING-CLASSIC-BDAYCAKE/30COOKING-CLASSIC-BDAYCAKE-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 582}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1006, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "112 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "sodiumContent": "574 milligrams", "sugarContent": "78 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick spray or butter for the pan", "1 cup/227 grams (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into 1-inch pieces, plus more, if necessary, for greasing the pans", "3 2/3 cups/471 grams all-purpose or cake flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters buttermilk", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters vegetable oil", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 cups/403 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/110 grams lightly packed light brown sugar", "5 large eggs", "3 large egg yolks", "12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped (chocolate chips are fine)", "8 ounces/227 grams sour cream, room temperature", "2 sticks/227 grams (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Generous pinch of kosher salt", "Lots of sprinkles"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
