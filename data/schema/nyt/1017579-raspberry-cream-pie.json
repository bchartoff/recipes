{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Raspberry Cream Pie", "description": "Here's a pie for the middle of summer, when the raspberries are ripe and dessert should be cool and creamy. Think of it as vanilla pudding in a pie shell, a messily delicious way to showcase the flavor of fresh raspberries.\n\nRuth P. Casa-Emellos, The Times's home economist, developed this recipe in the summer of 1952. It was published as French raspberry pie but later appeared in the recipe booklet \u201cFruit Pies: Delightful Confections Starring Fresh Fruits\u201d as raspberry cream pie. We\u2019ve made the red currant jelly optional. If you choose to include it, you\u2019ll get a gemlike glow and a crust-and-jam combination reminiscent of a homemade Pop-Tart.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/30/dining/raspberry-cream-pie/raspberry-cream-pie-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert, eggs, raspberries, vanilla bean, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 67}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 311, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "39 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "232 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/453 milliliters whole milk", "1 whole vanilla bean", "1/3 cup/42 grams flour", "1/2 cup/100 grams sugar", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "4 egg yolks", "1 whole egg", "1/4 cup/56 milliliters cream, whipped", "1 deep nine-inch pie shell, baked", "1 pint/454 grams raspberries", "6 ounces/169 grams red currant jelly (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a double boiler or heat-resistant bowl set over a saucepan of water, scald milk with vanilla bean.
