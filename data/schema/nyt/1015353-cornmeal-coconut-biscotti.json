Use fine or medium-grind cornmeal and make sure to use fine coconut flakes. I used organic sugar (not brown) for these; the sugar is off-white rather than white, and coarser than regular granulated sugar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/05/science/08recipehealth/08recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "3 dozen biscotti ", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegetarian, dessert, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 24}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 78, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "27 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["125 grams (approximately 1 cup) whole wheat flour", "30 grams (approximately 1/4 cup) all-purpose flour", "125 grams (approximately 3/4 cup) fine or medium-ground cornmeal", "90 grams (approximately 1 cup) unsweetened fine coconut flakes", "5 grams (approximately 1 teaspoon) baking powder", "Pinch of salt", "55 grams (2 ounces) coconut oil", "125 grams (2/3 cup tightly packed) organic sugar", "165 grams (3 large) eggs", "5 grams (approximately 1 teaspoon) vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
