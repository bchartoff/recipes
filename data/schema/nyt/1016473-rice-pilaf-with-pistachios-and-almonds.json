{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rice Pilaf With Pistachios and Almonds", "description": "This dish is inspired by a number of Persian rice pilafs, but it\u2019s simpler, and calls for much less butter than an authentic Persian pilaf. There are sweet and tart flavors at play here, especially if you use barberries, but apricots also have a tart edge to them. Rose water makes the pilaf wonderfully fragrant.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/03/science/04recipehealth/04recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 133}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 343, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "46 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "463 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup basmati rice or purple jasmine rice", "2 cups water or stock (chicken or vegetable)", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, unsalted butter or ghee", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion (optional)", "Salt to taste", "2 teaspoons rose water", "1/4 cup pistachios, coarsely chopped (30 grams)", "1/4 cup almonds, blanched, skinned and coarsely chopped (35 grams)", "1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/4 cup barberries or chopped dried apricots, soaked in warm water for 1/2 hour and drained"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place rice in a bowl in the sink and rinse several times with water, or soak for 30 minutes to an hour.
