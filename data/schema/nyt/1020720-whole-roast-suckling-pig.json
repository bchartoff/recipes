{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Roast Suckling Pig", "description": "A whole roast suckling pig is quite special. No other feast food of the holiday season cooks so easily, and presents so majestically. With its mahogany, crisp skin and its sticky-tender meat, people thrill to be at the party where this is on the buffet. Measure your oven, and be firm with your butcher about the pig\u2019s size, so you can be sure it will fit \u2014 most home ovens can easily accommodate a 20-pounder. Then, just give the pig the time it needs in a low and slow oven for its meat to reach its signature tender, succulent perfection, while you clean the house or do whatever it is you do before a special party. For the last 30 minutes, ramp the heat of the oven all the way up to get that insanely delicious crackling skin.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/22/magazine/22mag-eat-image/22mag-eat-image-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, project", "keywords": "fall, winter, garlic, rosemary, suckling pig, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 232}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small (15- to 20-pound) suckling pig", "20 garlic cloves, peeled", "1/2 cup neutral oil", "Coarse kosher salt", "1 small potato", "1 small apple", "1 lavish bunch each fresh rosemary, sage and bay leaves (still on the branch if you can manage it), for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees.

Take large pinches of kosher salt, and raising your arm high above the pig, rain down the salt in an even, light dusting all over.

Add a little water to the roasting pan along the way if you see the juices are in danger of scorching, and loosely tent the animal with aluminum foil in vulnerable spots \u2014 ears, snout, arc of back \u2014 if you see them burning.
