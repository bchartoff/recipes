{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pepperoni Lover\u2019s French Bread Pizza", "description": "An easy no-cook sauce works as a tangy base for pizzas of all kinds. Draining the tomatoes before seasoning ensures the sauce won\u2019t create any soggy bottoms, no matter what type of crust you build your pizza on. Use an equal amount of crushed or whole peeled tomatoes instead of diced if that\u2019s what you have on hand. Just use your hands to break whole tomatoes up a bit (and drain off any additional liquid). The sauce will keep, tightly covered in the refrigerator, for about 5 days. But feel free to use your favorite jarred marinara in its place. Leftover pizza reheats beautifully in a 350-degree oven until warmed through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dawn Perry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/19/dining/14FRENCHBREADREX3/merlin_200287080_7022dc29-ef0a-47cd-a683-b4acf72f0264-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weekday, weeknight, pizza and calzones, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "french bread, mozzarella, pepperoni", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 411}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, drained", "1 garlic clove, grated", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "A few grinds of black pepper", "1/4 cup olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "1 loaf soft French bread, split lengthwise, insides mostly dug out", "4 ounces mozzarella, low-moisture and part-skim, or fresh (drained and patted dry, if necessary), grated or torn (about 1 cup)", "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "2 ounces sliced pepperoni, quartered (about 1/2 cup)", "Red-pepper flakes or dried oregano, or both, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: Heat the oven to 450 degrees with a rack in the middle position.
