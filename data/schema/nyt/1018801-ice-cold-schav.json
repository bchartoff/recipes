{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ice-Cold Schav", "description": "Nothing revives and refreshes in a heat wave like this ice-cold schav, made with the exceptionally tart herb sorrel. The soup is seasoned at each stage: You salt the sweating shallots, the cooking potatoes, again when you add the sorrel and finally again when all is combined, which seems like a lot of salt. But once the mixture is chilled, the flavors are masked and dulled so it will taste just right. Using the stems of herbs is a habit I've formed in general, but in the case of sorrel I wish it were an herb all on its own \u2014\u00a0that you could just buy sorrel stems. I've seen Instagrammable versions of the soup with the egg cut into pristine wedges and bright green watercress substituted for drab muddy sorrel, but I think the way to go here is without vanity: Scatter well-chopped hard-boiled egg liberally over the drab soup, and follow with the minced stems, also liberally.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/18/magazine/18eat/18mag-18eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "eastern european", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "egg, potato, sorrel", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 273, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "921 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons butter", "1 medium shallot, peeled and finely minced", "1 large russet potato, peeled and trimmed into the shape of a rectangular box, then small-diced.
