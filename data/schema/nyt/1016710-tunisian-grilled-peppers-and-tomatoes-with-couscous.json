The couscous can be served warm or at room temperature.\nThis makes a heavenly summer meal. Reconstitute some couscous and top with this spicy, juicy mix of grilled pepper and tomato salad.  You can serve the couscous warm or at room temperature. The pepper salad is typical of Tunisian grilled salads (mechwya), of which there are many versions (eggplant can be included in the mix). In Tunisia, a spice mix called tabil would be used to season the peppers. I keep the mix on hand, without the dried garlic, but here I\u2019ve given you a mix of spices to use. You can substitute tabil if you have some; the mix will be a little hotter because there is cayenne in the tabil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/05/science/04recipehealth/04recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 35}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 249, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "41 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "479 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large bell peppers, preferably a mix of red, yellow and green or yellow, orange and red (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "2 green Anaheim peppers", "1 pound ripe but firm tomatoes", "1 or 2 garlic cloves, to taste", "Salt to taste", "1/4 teaspoon ground caraway", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "Pinch of cayenne (more to taste)", "1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice, to taste", "2 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, to taste", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "1 to 1 1/2 cups couscous, reconstituted (3 to 4 1/2 cups reconstituted couscous)", "Imported black olives for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Grill peppers over a hot grill or a gas flame, or under a  broiler, until charred.
