But this week while I was buying a nice bunch of beets at the market and another customer asked the vendor to cut off the greens from her beets, I jumped at the chance to get two bunches of free greens. I brought them home, stemmed and cleaned them thoroughly, then blanched them for a minute in salted boiling water. I enjoyed them all week. I made this bruschetta for dinner one night when I was home alone.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/25/science/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for one", "keywords": "beet greens, country bread, eggs, healthy, high fiber, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 386, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "537 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 or 2 eggs", "1 thick slice (1 inch) or 2 thinner slices whole-grain country bread (about 2 ounces)", "1 garlic clove, cut in half", "2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup blanched or steamed beet greens, coarsely chopped about 2 1/2 ounces", "Chopped fresh chives (optional)", "1/2 ounce fontina or Gruy\u00e8re, thinly sliced or grated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Poach the eggs first and set aside in a bowl of warm water."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lightly toast the bread, and rub with the cut side of the garlic clove.
