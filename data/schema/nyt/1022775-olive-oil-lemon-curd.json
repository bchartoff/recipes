{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Olive Oil Lemon Curd", "description": "This dairy-free version of lemon curd is lighter than more traditional, butter-enriched versions, but is just as tart and creamy. The olive oil gives it a complex flavor that can range from herbal and grassy to earthy and mellow, depending on the brand. Mound this lemon curd into a tart, use it as a cake filling, pile it onto a Pavlova, or serve it as is, topped with berries or other fruit. It keeps for at least a week in the fridge and freezes well for up to 1 month. And you can even make it in the microwave (see Tip).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/24/dining/19HANUKKAHrex3/merlin_197671413_bbf746f7-361b-4301-8c48-11eca09d1e59-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "eggs, lemon, olive oil, hanukkah", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 258}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 milliliters freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 4 to 6 lemons)", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs", "1 egg yolk", "2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (from 1 lemon)", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the lemon juice, sugar, eggs, egg yolk, lemon zest and salt in a blender, and blend until smooth, about 30 seconds.
