It is a lovely layer cake that makes economical use of yolks and whites, and it\u2019s nothing like what a New Yorker thinks of as cheesecake. The \u201ccheese\u201d is really an eggy lemon curd piled between layers of cake made sturdy by egg whites. More lemon curd covers the whole cake, its layers visible beneath the slightly translucent jelly. The cake tastes better the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One  layer cake", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 28}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature, more to grease pan", "3 1/4 cups cake flour", "2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "2 cups granulated sugar", "8 egg whites", "1 cup milk", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 1/4 cups granulated sugar", "3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted", "12 egg yolks", "3 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

If layers slide while frosting, push 3 or 4 long wooden skewers through them to hold until cake sets. Cake is best left covered at room temperature overnight."}]}
