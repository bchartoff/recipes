{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Yo Po Mian", "description": "A staple dish from the Shaanxi Province in China\u2019s central northwest, yo po mian literally means \u201coil sprinkled noodles.\u201d It\u2019s traditionally made with biang biang, or hand-torn flat noodles, but wide wheat noodles are used here for a quick weeknight meal. (In a pinch, any dried noodles will work.) This dish packs a lot of flavor, but its preparation is deceptively simple: Noodles and greens are topped with raw garlic and chiles, then hot oil is poured over the top, which coaxes the flavor out of the aromatics. Yo po mian is typically very garlicky, but that\u2019s been dialed back here with just four cloves. (Use more or less, depending upon your personal preference.) You could add ground Sichuan peppercorns for tangy spice, and if you have dark soy sauce, you can substitute it for half of the soy sauce in this recipe, as it will add deep sweetness and rich caramel flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/10/dining/hm-hot-oil-noodles/merlin_187482159_40afa58a-505f-4ba6-af5c-7e88c117b8de-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, noodles, main course", "keywords": "bok choy, garlic, soy sauce, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1633}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "12 ounces dried wide wheat noodles", "4 heads baby bok choy (about 12 ounces), trimmed and sliced lengthwise into 4 pieces", "4 small garlic cloves, peeled and grated", "8 teaspoons soy sauce", "4 teaspoons black vinegar", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste", "2 scallions, thinly sliced", "1 handful cilantro leaves", "8 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
