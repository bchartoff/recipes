{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach-Artichoke Lasagna", "description": "Inspired by the artichoke slice at Artichoke Basille\u2019s Pizza in New York City, this white sauce lasagna is a dreamy multilayered dinner. Frizzling chopped canned artichoke hearts in olive oil reduces their water content, thereby concentrating their earthy, buttery flavor. What binds the dish together is a nutmeg-rich b\u00e9chamel sauce that makes everything taste comforting and familiar. Cottage cheese in place of the more traditional ricotta nixes any potential for the grainy dryness that plagues so many lasagnas. Layering this creamy, saucy wonder in an 8-inch square pan leaves you with the perfect amount of leftovers for when you want some as a snack \u2014 a snacking lasagna, if you will.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/26/dining/EK-spinach-artichoke-lasagna1/merlin_205978074_4b8f8b5a-8508-4d55-9e77-1740c9181a59-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "artichoke, lasagna, spinach, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1536}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup olive oil", "1 (14-ounce) can artichoke hearts, coarsely chopped and well drained", "1 (5-ounce) package baby spinach", "Salt and black pepper", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "4 cups half-and-half (or 2 cups each whole milk and heavy cream)", "Freshly grated nutmeg", "12 dry lasagna noodles (10 to 12 ounces)", "8 ounces cottage cheese (heaping 3/4 cup)", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan (2 ounces)", "1 large egg", "1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese (4 ounces)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
