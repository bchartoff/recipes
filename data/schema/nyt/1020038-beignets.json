{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beignets", "description": "The French might have been the first to deep-fry choux pastry, but it\u2019s in New Orleans that beignets became a true mainstay in bakeries and cafes. This version is relatively easy to make at home: The yeast-leavened dough comes together quickly, is very forgiving to work with and fries up light and airy. The yeast must be fresh and active: Once stirred with warm water and sugar, let the mixture stand for 10 minutes. If the yeast is fresh, it will create a foamy, bubbly layer on top. (If this doesn\u2019t happen, you\u2019ll need to start over with new yeast.) You can cook the beignets in a Dutch oven or deep skillet, no deep-fryer necessary. To obtain the perfect puffs, fry the fritters in batches so they have plenty of room to cook evenly on all sides. Beignets are best eaten hot, buried in a blanket of powdered sugar.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/05/dining/05kc-beignets/merlin_150865437_30e3a845-e17d-4688-a595-ca13cef488bc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H45M", "recipeYield": "About 3 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, snack, finger foods, pastries", "keywords": "active dry yeast, confectioners' sugar, milk, sugar, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 228}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 64, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "30 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters warm water", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters whole milk", "1 large egg", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 1/2 cups/450 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "Vegetable oil, for greasing the bowl and deep-frying", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine yeast, 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and warm water; use a fork to mix well.
