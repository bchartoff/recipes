{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry-Pear Crumble Bars", "description": "Sweet pears and tart cranberries pair perfectly in these treats, which are part bar cookie, and part fruit crisp. Here, both crust and crumble topping are made from the same almond flour-rolled oat mixture mixture, giving it a nutty flavor. Precooking the filling allows the fruit to soften and release some juices ahead of time so the bottom crust stays nice and crisp. The result is a chewy, fruity cookie that just as easily a perfect afternoon snack as it is a paired with some ice cream for dessert. Choose pears that are on the firm side of ripe: Comice and Anjou both work great.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/01/dining/01COOKING-CRANPEARCRUMBLEBAR2/01COOKING-CRANPEARCRUMBLEBAR2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 9x9-inch pan", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 250}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/454 grams pears (2 large), ripe but firm", "2 cups/200 grams fresh cranberries", "1/2 cup/101 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons orange juice", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/220 grams light brown sugar, packed", "1 cup/112 grams almond flour", "1 cup/99 grams rolled oats", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/227 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees and line a 9x9-inch baking dish with parchment paper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare filling: Peel, core and chop the pears into 1/2-inch pieces.
