You must be fearless and ruthless, but conservative. Cut off the top of the less squiggly end, and then cut down along the sides, following the contour of the root and taking as little of the flesh as possible. You will find much of the bottom part comes off more easily than you&rsquo;d imagine. When you&rsquo;re nearly done, use a paring knife to trim out as much of the brown skin as you can &mdash; but don&rsquo;t worry if you leave a few bits. Julienne by hand (you&rsquo;re a better man than I, if you do!) or with the grating disk of a food processor, which will take no time at all. Sprinkle with a little salt and put into a serving bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the mayonnaise in the food processor: Put the egg, mustard, salt, pepper and acid in a food processor (preferably with a small bowl) and turn on the machine.
