{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Seared Pork Cutlets With Green Garlic Salsa Verde", "description": "This recipe amplifies the green in the garlic by stirring it into an herb-filled salsa verde. You can also use regular garlic, though you might want to reduce the amount by half.\n\nI also added garlic chives to the mix just because I saw them at the farmers\u2019 market and figured a little more garlic flavor could only help. (Regular chives are perfectly fine.)\n\nThe sauce, with plenty of chopped parsley and mint, is intense, bright and herbal. It makes a bright counterpoint to rich slices of seared pork. I used butterflied slices of loin that cook very quickly, but you can use bone-in chops if you give them a few more minutes on the fire (or pound them first).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/06/dining/06APPE_SPAN/06APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, green garlic, parsley, pork, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 386}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 613, "unsaturatedFatContent": "36 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "47 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "44 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "610 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup chopped parsley", "3 tablespoons chopped mint", "2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic chives or regular chives", "2 tablespoons finely chopped green garlic", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1/8 teaspoon chile flakes", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "4 eight-ounce boneless pork loin chops, butterflied (1/4-inch thick)", "Black pepper, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the herbs, garlic, lemon, 1 teaspoon salt and chile flakes.
