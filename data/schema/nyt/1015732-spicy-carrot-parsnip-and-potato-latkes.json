Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the oil and when it is hot, take up heaped tablespoons of the latke mixture, press the mixture against the spoon to extract liquid (or squeeze in your hands), and place in the pan. Press down with the back of the spatula to flatten. Repeat with more spoonfuls, being careful not to crowd the pan. In my 10-inch pan I can cook 4 at a time without crowding; my 12-inch pan will accommodate 5.  Cook on one side until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Slide the spatula underneath and flip the latkes over. Cook on the other side until golden brown, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the rack set over a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. The mixture will continue to release liquid, which will accumulate in the bottom of the bowl. Stir from time to time, and remember to squeeze the heaped tablespoons of the mix before you add them to the pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Serve hot topped with low-fat sour cream, Greek yogurt or cr\u00e8me fraiche, or other toppings of your choice such as salsa, chutney or yogurt blended with cilantro, mint, and garlic."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015732-spicy-carrot-parsnip-and-potato-latkes"}
