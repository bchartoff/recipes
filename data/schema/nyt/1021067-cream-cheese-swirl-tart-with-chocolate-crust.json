{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cream Cheese Swirl Tart With Chocolate Crust", "description": "This eye-catching tart nods to a classic fruit-topped cheesecake, but is far easier to put together and starts with a cocoa-and-oat streusel press-in crust, instead of traditional graham crackers. Fruit preserves are folded into the tangy no-bake filling to create swirls. You can serve the tart immediately, or keep it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Using a pan with a removable base allows you to unmold the tart and serve it on a platter, but you could also use a glass or ceramic pan and serve the dish directly from the pan. Serve alone, or top with fresh berries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/06/dining/ejm-cream-cheese-streusel-tart/ejm-cream-cheese-streusel-tart-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch tart (8 to 12 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "almond extract, brown sugar, butter, cocoa, confectioners' sugar, cream, cream cheese, flour, jam, oats, vanilla, christmas, mother\u2019s day, valentine\u2019s day, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 175}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/95 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/40 grams old-fashioned oats", "1/4 cup/55 grams light brown sugar", "3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 cup/115 grams cold unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 1/2-inch/1-centimeter cubes", "6 ounces/170 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "3/4 cup/90 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters cold heavy cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters jam or preserves (such as strawberry, raspberry, blackberry or cherry)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: In a medium bowl, stir the flour, oats, brown sugar, cocoa powder, salt and baking powder to combine.

Use a small offset spatula or the back of a small spoon to swoop across the filling back and forth a few times to lightly swirl the jam into the filling, leaving some large streaks of jam.
