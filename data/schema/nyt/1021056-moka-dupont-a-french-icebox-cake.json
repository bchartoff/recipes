{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Moka Dupont: A French Icebox Cake", "description": "When my Paris friend, Bernard Collet, told me about this cake, a favorite for over 60 years in his family, I was expecting something tall, soft, frosted and fit for candles. I expected a ga\u0302teau but got an icebox cake: four layers of cookies held together with four layers of frosting. The cake, originally a back-of-the-box recipe, was created for a French tea biscuit called Th\u00e9 Brun, but I could never find them, so I used Petit Beurre cookies. Lately I can\u2019t find them either, so I use old-fashioned Nabisco Social Teas. You can use whatever cookies you\u2019d like, but they should be plain, flat, square or rectangular. Depending on the size of your cookies, you might need fewer of them; depending on how big or small you make the cake, you might need to juggle the number of layers or the amount of frosting. It\u2019s a recipe made for improvisation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/10/magazine/10-mag-eat/10-mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, butter, egg, icebox cake", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 652}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1/2 cup/100 grams plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 large, very fresh egg (preferably organic, since it will not be cooked)", "3 ounces/85 grams bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters hot espresso (made fresh or with instant espresso powder)", "64 Nabisco Social Tea Biscuits (from 1 12-ounce package), or other plain, preferably flat cookies", "Grated chocolate, for decoration"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Before you start assembling the cake, decide on the size you want.
