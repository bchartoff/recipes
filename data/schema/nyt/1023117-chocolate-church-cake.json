{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Church Cake", "description": "Layer cakes are formative for Southerners: They grace wedding tables, shiva gatherings, quincea\u00f1eras, baptisms and funerals. Because of this \u2014 and because layer cakes may be as close as some will ever get to a holy experience \u2014 they\u2019re often called church cakes. This chocolate one is a perfectly moist and stacked rendition of a pudding cake, with just the right amount of richness from the frosting. This formula needs no alterations, but there\u2019s no sense in breaking the tradition of Southern bakers, who personalize recipes as a point of pride. Add pulverized praline to the center, or cinnamon or instant-coffee granules to the batter. Don\u2019t be afraid to make it your own. To make it a true church cake, serve it to those you hold in the highest regard, for celebrations or to simply indulge in the good glory of company.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lisa Donovan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/08/dining/ld-church-cake/ld-church-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch layer cake", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "buttermilk, cocoa powder, heavy cream, layer cake, unsweetened chocolate, easter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1300}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/350 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 cups/325 grams heavy cream", "8 ounces/225 grams unsweetened chocolate", "6 ounces/170 grams unsalted butter", "1 teaspoon vanilla paste or extract", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 cup/120 grams unsweetened cocoa powder, dark (Dutch-processed) if available, plus more for pans", "3 1/2 cups/700 grams granulated sugar", "2 3/4 cups/365 grams all-purpose flour (see Tip)", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt", "3 large eggs, beaten", "1 1/2 cups/350 grams buttermilk, preferably cultured whole buttermilk", "3/4 cup/145 grams canola or other neutral oil", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the frosting: In a large saucepan, bring sugar and cream to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally.

You can refrigerate the cake in between frosting each layer to ensure that your frosting is set and firm so that your next layer will be propped up properly. If the frosting is too soft, the next layer will just flatten the filling. Frost the outside of the cake with the remaining frosting, letting it chill as you go if needed. Use an offset spatula or butter knife dipped in hot water and wiped clean to smooth and shine the finished cake. This cake keeps and is best served at room temperature for up to 2 days. It holds remarkably well in the refrigerator for up to one week and can be served cold."}], "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "hasPart": {"@type": "WebPageElement", "isAccessibleForFree": "False", "cssSelector": ".recipe"}, "publisher": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Organization", "name": "NYT Cooking", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com", "alternateName": ["nytimes cooking", "New York Times Cooking"], "image": [{"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoRed.svg", "height": 31, "width": 168, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}, {"url": "https://static01.nyt.com/applications/cooking/4c5221e/assets/SiteLogoBlack.svg", "height": 24, "width": 131, "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "ImageObject"}], "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/", "https://www.facebook.com/nytcooking/", "https://www.instagram.com/nytcooking/", "https://twitter.com/nytfood", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rIOwTqDuWkFj87HZYRFOg"]}, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023117-chocolate-church-cake"}
