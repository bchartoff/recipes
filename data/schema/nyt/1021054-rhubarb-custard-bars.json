{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rhubarb Custard Bars", "description": "Imagine lemon bars, but made with a tangy rhubarb curd instead of citrus, and you\u2019ll get a sense of this sweet-tart confection. The rhubarb curls on top make it pretty, but they don\u2019t add much in terms of flavor, so feel free to skip Step 5. With their crisp crust and soft topping, the bars are at their absolute best when served within a day of baking. But you can store leftovers in the fridge for up to five days. They\u2019ll get a little soggy, but the flavor will still be excellent.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/06/dining/01appetite-rhubarb/merlin_171960135_baba2429-ba96-47c8-9bb9-025c189d41fc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 (9-inch) square pan", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 813}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup/65 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3/4 cup/170 grams cold unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), cut into 1-inch pieces", "10 ounces rhubarb, sliced (2 1/2 cups), plus 1 slender red stalk for the top", "1 1/4 cups/250 grams granulated sugar", "4 large eggs", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (1 to 2 lemons)", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon finely grated orange or lemon zest", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees and line a 9-by-9-inch pan with parchment paper, leaving two edges long so they overhang the pan by at least 1 inch.
