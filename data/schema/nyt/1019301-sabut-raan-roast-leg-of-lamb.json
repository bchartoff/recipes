{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sabut Raan (Roast Leg of Lamb)", "description": "This recipe for a whole roasted leg of lamb comes from the cookbook author Sameen Rushdie, who wrote \"Indian Cookery,\" the classic published in Great Britain in 1988. On Sundays, after a matinee at the Metro Cub Club in Bombay, the Rushdie family often sat down to a special lunch of roast lamb. In this version, the yogurt marinade turns into a rich sauce as it mixes with the braising liquid in the oven. Ms. Rushdie still turns to the dish as the centerpiece of a dinner party, because it can be set up ahead of time and cooked in the oven. The leg is trimmed of all fat, so it\u2019s important to keep it moist: For the first couple of hours of cooking, keep it covered, with some water in the pan, then uncover and let the surface brown a little at the end.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/16/dining/16rushdierex/merlin_137836392_22d8ef4e-9b9a-480e-ad70-64b66cdaee0b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H45M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, meat, roasts", "keywords": "leg of lamb, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 83}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon poppy seeds", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds", "10 cloves", "15 black peppercorns", "1 cinnamon stick", "2 cardamom pods", "1 bay leaf", "6 garlic cloves, peeled", "3 inches ginger, peeled", "2 teaspoons salt", "8 ounces full-fat yogurt (1 cup)", "1 leg of lamb (4 pounds), bone-in, all fat trimmed", "1 large white onion, roughly chopped", "4 tablespoons clarified butter", "1/2 cup fried onions, for garnish", "1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro, for garnish", "1/2 lemon cut into thin slices, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small, dry saucepan over low heat, toast poppy seeds, coriander seeds, cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon, cardamom and bay leaf until they release their aromas.
