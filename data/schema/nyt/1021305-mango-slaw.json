{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mango Slaw", "description": "There is absolutely nothing new about coleslaw, but there is something slightly intriguing about coleslaw with mangos. Often, when we think of coleslaw, we think of it as a side for fish and chips, barbecue or heavy, mayonnaise-drenched cabbage. But just think about the cool, crunchy sweetness of the cabbage, carrots and mango, paired with the spicy kick of jerk chicken. What\u2019s a better combination? You also don\u2019t have to serve it as a side: It can be tucked into a sandwich or wrap. One of the best things about this recipe is that all the ingredients are readily available, and there are many shortcuts you can take, like using a bagged mix. Who wants to ruin their knuckles on a box grater, or break out the food processor?", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/30/dining/mp-mango-slaw/mp-mango-slaw-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, slaws, side dish", "keywords": "cilantro, cole slaw, mango, fourth of july, kwanzaa, labor day, memorial day, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1943}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (8-ounce) bag coleslaw (about 3 cups)", "2 large, slightly firm mangoes (about 1 3/4 pounds), peeled, pitted and thinly sliced (about 2 cups)", "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice", "1 tablespoon honey or agave syrup", "1/4 teaspoon celery salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine all ingredients.
