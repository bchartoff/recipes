This allows them to absorb moisture and softens them, so that the bread is wonderfully moist, and the seeds won\u2019t be hard on your teeth when you bite. Soaking the seeds also breaks down phytic acid and protease inhibitors, which allows the nutrients   to be more readily absorbed by the body. This is a two-day recipe, as you must allow time for soaking the seeds overnight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/03/science/03recipehealth/03recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5H15M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 59}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 266, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "279 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["25 grams sunflower seeds (approximately 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon)", "25 grams sesame seeds (approximately 2 1/2 tablespoons)", "25 grams flax seeds (approximately 2 1/2 tablespoons)", "25 grams rolled oats (approximately 1/4 cup)", "25 grams pumpkin seeds (approximately 2 tablespoons)", "180 grams water (approximately 3/4 cup) plus about 60 grams additional water", "170 grams bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour (approximately 1 1/3 cups)", "170 grams lukewarm water (approximately 3/4 cup less 2 teaspoons)", "4 grams dry yeast (approximately 1 teaspoon)", "250 grams whole-wheat flour (approximately 2 cups) or   125 grams bread flour and 125 grams whole-wheat flour", "12 grams sea salt (approximately 1 1/2 teaspoons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix seeds together with 180 grams of water in a medium mixing bowl; cover with plastic wrap and and let soak overnight in the refrigerator."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine 170 grams bread flour or all-purpose flour, 170 grams lukewarm water, and yeast in bowl of a standing mixer and mix together until well combined.

Have 1 cup water ready in a small cup or a glass. (If you have a large pizza stone, you can bake both loaves at once. If you have a standard home pizza stone, bake one loaf at a time and place the other loaf in the refrigerator to slow down the fermentation.) Dust a pizza peel or flat baking sheet lightly with flour, semolina or cornmeal and   place one loaf on top. Using a razor blade or a moistened bread knife, make a 1/2-inch deep horizontal cut down the middle of loaf from one end to the other, or if the loaves are round make 2 slashes across top. Slide loaf onto pizza stone and close oven door. Wait 30 seconds, then open oven door quickly and pour water onto the sheet pan on the bottom of the oven to create steam. After 5 minutes take the sheet pan out of the oven. Bake for a total of 30 to 35 minutes, until loaf is dark brown and sounds hollow when you tap the bottom. Transfer loaf to a wire rack to cool completely for 45 minutes.   Repeat with   other loaf."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016472-whole-wheat-seeded-loaves"}
