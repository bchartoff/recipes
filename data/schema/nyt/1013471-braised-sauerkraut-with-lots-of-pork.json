{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Braised Sauerkraut With Lots of Pork", "description": "Two classic mixed braises always come to mind at this time of year. One is cassoulet, based on white beans and a blend of goose, duck and pork. The better alternative for my purposes was choucroute garnie, a vat of simmering sauerkraut that serves as a nice bed on which to mix and match a variety of pig parts.\n\nThe beauty of a choucroute is that it lets you use whatever pork products you like or have on hand. A couple of hours later, the meat is cooked through while the sauerkraut has absorbed all the porky, smoky flavors, utterly transforming from pickled and puckery into something brawny in flavor and meltingly soft, especially if you add a couple of apples to bring out the cabbage\u2019s sweeter nature.\n\nPigs\u2019 feet are not necessarily traditional in choucroute, but they add excellent flavor and body to the mix. If you are like my husband and prefer to eat your meat with a knife and fork (and I know that he is not alone in that department), you can always leave them out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/braised-sauerkrait-pork/braised-sauerkrait-pork-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "country rib, sauerkraut, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 67}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 738, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "43 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "1625 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds pork rib tips or country ribs, rinsed and patted dry", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 pigs\u2019 feet, halved lengthwise (have your butcher do the cutting), rinsed and patted dry", "2 cups not-too-dry white wine", "2 bay leaves", "1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "4 bratwurst, smoked or unsmoked", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 medium onions, halved and thinly sliced", "3 tart apples, peeled, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1 fat garlic clove, finely chopped", "3 pounds sauerkraut, rinsed and drained", "2 large carrots, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 large smoked pork chop", "Boiled potatoes, for serving", "Chopped fresh parsley, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
