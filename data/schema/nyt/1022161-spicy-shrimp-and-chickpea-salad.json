{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Shrimp and Chickpea Salad", "description": "This warm salad of garlicky shrimp and herby chickpeas comes together in just 15 minutes and requires very little effort. Canned chickpeas, Fresno chiles, parsley and red onion get a quick marinade in a creamy citrus dressing while the shrimp cooks in a little garlic and olive oil. Fresno chile adds a little heat, but if you\u2019re sensitive to spice, you can remove the membranes and seeds before adding the chile to the salad. Make the dish your own by adding arugula, or swap the parsley for cilantro or the shrimp for scallops. Serve warm with a hunk of crusty bread, and enjoy leftovers straight from the fridge the next day with a squeeze of lime or lemon juice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/03/dining/yf-Spicy-Shrimp-and-Chickpea-Salad/merlin_186367128_e9f5e0f5-0dbc-4dd8-bfde-a9bb4ce52026-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "chickpea, fresno pepper, jalape\u00f1o, salad, shrimp", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2115}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium lemon, zested and juiced", "1 lime, zested and halved", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "5 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1/2 small red onion, diced (about 1/4 cup)", "1 Fresno chile or jalape\u00f1o, cut into thin coins or seeded and diced", "1 packed cup parsley leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped", "2 large garlic cloves, grated or minced", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined, patted dry"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large serving bowl, combine the lemon zest and juice, lime zest and mustard.
