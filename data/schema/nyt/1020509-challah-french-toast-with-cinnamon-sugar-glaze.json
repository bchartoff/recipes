{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Challah French Toast With Cinnamon-Sugar Glaze", "description": "Thick slices of soft challah bread make for superior French toast, with a plush, custardy center and golden, crisp edges. This version has extra egg yolks for added richness, and a dash of cardamom for spice. Cinnamon-sugar is sprinkled on top of the challah slices as they cook, caramelizing and glazing them (though you can skip this step, if you want). If you want to work ahead, soak the challah slices in the custard mixture the night before, storing everything in the fridge, then add a few extra minutes onto the cooking time to make sure the centers are cooked through.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/dining/mc-challah-french-toast/mc-challah-french-toast-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, breads", "keywords": "cardamom, challah, challah bread, cinnamon, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 116}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups whole milk", "1/2 cup heavy cream or half-and-half (or use more milk)", "4 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (optional)", "3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "Pinch of salt", "1 loaf challah bread (about 1 pound), cut into 1 1/4-inch slices", "4 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Maple syrup", "Cherry or other jam", "Whipped mascarpone or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "Berries", "Sliced bananas", "Chopped pineapple chunks", "Mini chocolate chips"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together milk, cream, eggs and egg yolks, vanilla, lemon zest (if using), 1/2 teaspoon cardamom and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange challah slices in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet.
