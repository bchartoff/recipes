Deer becomes venison, and then becomes dinner. Rabbit is served as lapin \u00e0 la moutarde, or pappardelle et coniglio, or conejo en mole -- more elegant phrasing perhaps, but rabbit stew all the same.\n\nTraditional rabbit stews are usually rather painstaking. A perfect Mexican mole sauce, I was told by an octogenarian cook in Oaxaca, the world capital of mole sauce, is a full day's work -- pounding, crushing, roasting, mixing and simmering. In any culture, the work is worth the delicious final product.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "Four to five servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weekday", "keywords": "chicken broth, rabbit, spices, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 8}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 553, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1063 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon bacon fat", "1 2 1/2-pound rabbit, cut into 7 pieces", "1 medium onion, minced", "4 cloves garlic, minced", "1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste", "2 cups chicken broth", "8 dried ancho chilies, soaked in 2 cups boiling water for 30 minutes", "1 cup drained, stewed whole tomatoes", "1/4 cup sesame seeds, toasted", "1 tablespoon oregano", "2 whole cloves", "2 whole allspice", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "9 cloves garlic, peeled", "1/4 cup ripe banana", "2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs", "1/2 ounce bitter chocolate, melted", "1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large heavy casserole, warm the bacon fat.
