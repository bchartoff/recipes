{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peppermint Stripe Cookies", "description": "Inspired by a series of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/155990/study-for-cite-brushstrokes-cut-into-twenty-squares-and-arranged-by-chance\">brushstroke paintings</a><span> by Ellsworth Kelly, these sugar cookies are meant to be lined up in a tight grid, painted with bold red stripes and arranged randomly. To paint on cookies, they must be first coated with royal icing and allowed to dry, preferably overnight. Luster dust and petal dust, colored powders used in cake decorating, are mixed with peppermint extract (or lemon extract, if you prefer) as a medium. (The dusts are available from cake-decorating stores, craft stores or online.) Make sure the peppermint extract you use is primarily alcohol, which evaporates immediately, leaving the pigment behind, and not primarily peppermint oil, which might stain the cookies. Flat, soft art brushes work best to apply the color, and a plastic paint tray with wells is best for mixing them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/dining/ss-peppermint-cookies/merlin_163737039_887f876e-3127-4a9c-8590-72d919233775-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 2 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, egg whites, peppermint extract, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 574}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/245 grams unsifted confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more if needed", "2 egg whites (or 2 tablespoons meringue powder and 4 tablespoons water)", "A few drops of glycerin, if desired to create more of a sheen (optional)", "1 <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020651\">recipe Basic Sugar Cookies</a>, dough flavored with 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract (omit the vanilla extract), cut into 3-inch squares and cooled", "Red and pink petal dust and luster dust"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the royal icing: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, combine the confectioners\u2019 sugar, egg whites and glycerin, if using.

Mix the petal dust and luster dust with enough peppermint extract to make a very loose \u201cwash\u201d and, using brushes of different widths, make continuous brushstrokes in a few different widths across the entire surface. If you run out of pigment as you\u2019re brushing, dip the brush again, and continue the line, allowing the brush texture to show in places. When dry, rearrange the cookies on a platter so the lines no longer match up.
