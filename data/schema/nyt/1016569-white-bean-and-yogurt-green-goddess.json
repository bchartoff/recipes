It has that creamy appeal that ranch dressing also has, with the heady flavor and fragrance of fresh tarragon, which is the key to its flavor. The base is modeled on the bean and yogurt salad dressing base that the Sodexo chef Lisa Feldman has introduced to school lunch programs. Serve it as a dip with spring vegetables like artichokes and asparagus or with crispy salads.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/10/science/10recipehealth/10recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 cup, about 6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 45}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 81, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "150 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small garlic clove, halved, green shoot removed", "1/2 cup cooked white beans, drained and rinsed if using canned beans", "1/2 cup whole milk or 2 percent Greek yogurt or regular yogurt", "1 ice cube, if using Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Process garlic in a food processor fitted with a steel blade until minced garlic is adhering to sides.
