It is based on a popular Indian snack called pakora. I much prefer the nutty, crisp chickpea flour coating to other flour-based batters, and those who cannot tolerate wheat will be very happy with it. You can find chickpea flour in Mediterranean markets and Indian markets.

It\u2019s important that the oil be hot enough that the vegetables will cook quickly without absorbing much oil. Use a deep-fry thermometer, and make sure to bring the oil back up to temperature between batches. Whisk the batter, which will have separated. Working in batches so that you don\u2019t crowd the pan, dip the vegetables in the batter to coat thoroughly, and carefully place in the hot oil. It should take less than two minutes to achieve a golden brown crust. Carefully remove from the oil using a deep-fry skimmer, tongs or a spider, and drain on paper towels, then transfer to a baking sheet. Keep warm in a 200-degree oven while you continue to cook the remaining vegetables. Serve once all the vegetables have been cooked."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014062-chickpea-batter-fried-vegetables"}
