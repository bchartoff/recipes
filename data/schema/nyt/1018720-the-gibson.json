{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "The Gibson", "description": "As with many classic cocktails, numerous origin stories have attached themselves to The Gibson like barnacles, and the truth is uncertain. One thing is clear, however: <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018721-pickled-cocktail-onions\">the pickled onion</a> hasn\u2019t always been part of the Gibson legend. The recipe in my 1933 edition of The Savoy Cocktail Book is essentially a formula for what many would call a 50/50 martini \u2014 half gin, half dry vermouth, with a faint spritz of lemon essence. Nonetheless, we now tend to regard The Gibson as a martini in which a cocktail onion is swapped in for the usual olive \u2014 and that\u2019s the version of the story I\u2019m sticking with in this recipe. Play with the proportions to your taste, but, as usual, I recommend that you don\u2019t stint on the vermouth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rosie Schaap"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09drink/09drink-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "gin, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 124, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "4 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 oz.
