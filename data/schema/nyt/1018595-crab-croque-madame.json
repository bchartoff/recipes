{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crab Croque-Madame", "description": "Every Francophile has eaten a croque-monsieur, which is essentially a hot ham and cheese sandwich, the top spread with a layer of b\u00e9chamel sauce and grated cheese, then grilled until golden and bubbly. You can get one in any caf\u00e9, where it is eaten from a little plate, either at a small table or standing at the bar, using a knife and fork. A croque-madame is exactly the same, with a fried egg on top. Why is it madame when it has an egg? No one knows. I decided to make a version with crab meat, which I thought would be novel, until I discovered it had already been invented, many times over. It seems there already exists the crab toastie, an American open-face snack made with English muffins. And crab toasties are well known in the British Isles as well. I pushed mine in a slightly creole direction, adding cayenne, tarragon and chives.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/01/dining/01KITCH-SUB/01KITCH-SUB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, sandwiches", "keywords": "cheddar, crab meat, eggs, gruy\u00e8re, ham, toast, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 106}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 403, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "968 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Unsalted butter", "6 slices rustic country bread, about 1/2 inch thick, or day-old white bread,\u00a0sliced 3/4 inch thick", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "2 cups whole milk, heated", "Salt and pepper", "Pinch of grated nutmeg", "1/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 pound cooked crab meat", "1 teaspoon paprika", "Pinch of cayenne", "Pinch of smoked Spanish piment\u00f3n dulce or chipotle powder", "1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons snipped chives, plus more for garnish", "1 teaspoon chopped tarragon", "6 thin slices ham or prosciutto cotto", "4 ounces grated white Cheddar or Gruy\u00e8re cheese, about 1 1/2 cups", "6 small eggs", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.
