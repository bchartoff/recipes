Its salty, chewy character is just one of the exciting bits about this grain bowl. Other highlights include crisp mushrooms, which roast alongside the halloumi; dollops of olive-studded yogurt; and whatever bright and crunchy herbs and vegetables you like or need to use up. To easily enjoy the full range of textures in each bite, instead of simply piling each element on top of the grains, layer them as if you are building nachos. It\u2019s a small tweak, but one that makes for an even more satisfying bowl of grains.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/20/dining/as-roasted-mushroom-grain-bowl/merlin_213230274_1d9c89ae-4388-4b4c-8db8-e47f24defbc3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cremini, farro, grain bowl, greek yogurt, halloumi, kalamata olive, make-ahead, pearl barley, scallion, sour cream, white mushrooms, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 464}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound cremini or button mushrooms, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1 bunch scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths", "8 to 9 ounces halloumi, torn into bite-size pieces", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "1 cup pearled barley or farro", "1 cup Greek yogurt or sour cream", "1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and coarsely chopped", "1 lemon", "1 1/2 to 2 cups thinly sliced raw vegetables (such as brussels sprouts, celery, fennel, cucumbers and radishes)", "1/3 cup torn mint, dill or watercress"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
