{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Butternut Squash Pasta With Spinach", "description": "Here\u2019s a vegetable-filled pasta bake that comes together in under an hour. The most time-consuming part of this recipe is prepping the squash. You can buy precut squash, or cut it yourself: Trim the ends so that it can stand up flat. Use a sturdy vegetable peeler to remove the skin. Cut off the bulbous part from the neck. Scoop the seeds out of the bulbous part. Half the squash lengthwise, then cube it. If you\u2019re sensitive to heat, leave out the jalape\u00f1os, or remove the seeds before slicing into rounds and placing on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/08/dining/yf-butternut-squash-pasta/merlin_177593400_7ce5ec26-fc80-4c53-ba83-a8428b5ab3f4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "butternut squash, jalape\u00f1o, mozzarella, parmesan, penne, spinach, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 5804}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving", "1 medium butternut squash (about 2 1/2 pounds), peeled, seeds removed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 6 cups)", "1 tablespoon ground cumin (see Tip)", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed", "1 pound penne or other tubular pasta", "1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth (or water)", "3/4 cup grated Parmesan", "3 packed cups baby spinach", "1 (8-ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, torn into bite-size chunks", "1 jalape\u00f1o, sliced into rounds", "1/3 cup flat-leaf parsley and tender stems, roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large covered pot of heavily salted water to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, in a 12-inch ovenproof skillet with high sides and a tight-fitting lid (or a Dutch oven), heat the oil over medium-high until shimmering.
