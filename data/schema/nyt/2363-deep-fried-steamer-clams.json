When it is quite hot (365 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer) add about one quarter of the clams and cook, stirring so that they brown evenly, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. As the clams brown and become crisp, scoop them out with a perforated kitchen spoon onto absorbent paper towels. Add another batch of clams. Continue cooking until all the clams are crisp and browned."}]}
