{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Basic Polenta", "description": "Polenta is basically cornmeal mush, and it can be made with any kind of cornmeal, ground coarse, medium or fine. (You don\u2019t need bags marked \u201cpolenta.\u201d) As with most ingredients, though, the better the cornmeal you start with, the better your result in the kitchen. The trick is cooking the polenta for a sufficient amount of time. You must allow the cornmeal to swell and become fully cooked. That way, you emphasize the sweet corn flavor and don\u2019t end up with something bitter and lame. Yes, it takes a long time. But it\u2019s worth it \u2014 and you can fry the leftovers tomorrow night in a snap.\n", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/14/dining/basicpolenta/basicpolenta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "cornmeal, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 601}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 100, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "62 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and pepper", "1 cup medium or fine cornmeal", "Butter ", "Parmesan for soft polenta, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For firm polenta use 4 cups water; for soft polenta use 5 cups water.
