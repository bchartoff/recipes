{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grits and Shrimp", "description": "This recipe, adapted from the chefs David Chang and Joaquin Baca of Momofuku Noodle Bar, came to The Times in 2006. Here, the yolk from soft egg bleeds into a bed of grits. A bit of chopped bacon adds smokiness, while the chopped scallion lends brightness. You'll want to use good quality grits here over cornmeal or polenta, as both Mr. Chang and Mr. Baca suggest. The result is luxurious and creamy, without any cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/dining/Stone-ground-grits/Stone-ground-grits-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 main course servings or 4 starters", "recipeCuisine": "asian, southern", "recipeCategory": "brunch, quick", "keywords": "eggs, grits, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 234}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 740, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "1373 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups chicken or pork stock", "1 cup stone-ground grits", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup chopped bacon", "4 tablespoons butter", "12 medium-to-large shrimp, peeled", "2 poached (or warm-bath-cooked) eggs", "1/4 cup chopped scallion"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat stock in saucepan over medium heat.
