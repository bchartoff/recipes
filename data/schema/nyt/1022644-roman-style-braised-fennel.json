{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roman-Style Braised Fennel", "description": "Fennel is a crunchy, assertively anise-flavored vegetable that mellows and sweetens when cooked. Here, the vegetable is prepared in the style of carciofi alla Romana, or braised whole artichokes, which is a simple preparation of simmering them in aromatic olive oil until incredibly tender. The braising liquid is infused with bright lemon, fragrant garlic and fresh herbs, which impart the fennel and shallots with layers of flavor. This versatile side dish can be served warm or at room temperature, and leftovers can be chopped and tossed with spaghetti and Parmesan for an easy meal. The unused fennel stalks can be chopped and saut\u00e9ed as part of a vegetable soup, and the fronds can be used in place of dill to make gravlax.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/15/dining/kc-roman-style-braised-fennel/merlin_197633025_50fdbc80-4fbd-460c-a981-e295c52f6543-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "fennel, olive oil, shallot, thanksgiving, vegetarian, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 202}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "8 ounces shallots, peeled and thinly sliced", "Salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "3 pounds medium fennel heads, trimmed of stalks and bulbs quartered through the core\u00a0", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "1 oregano sprig", "6 parsley sprigs plus 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 12-inch high-sided skillet, melt butter over medium.
