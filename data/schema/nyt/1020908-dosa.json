{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dosa", "description": "Many diners in the United States know dosas as the crisp, oversize folds served at South Indian restaurants. But those dosas have a large extended family: dosas from Karnataka made with grated cucumber; dosas from Tamil Nadu made with pearl millet flour; and dosas from Kerala made with jaggery. There are lacy-edged dosas and cakelike dosas, delicate dosas that crumple like hankies, and fat, deeply pocked dosas that break where they\u2019re creased. If you\u2019ve never made dosas at home, a good place to start is this simple rice and urad dal batter. Traditionally, the batter relies on a wild fermentation that flourishes in warm kitchens, but many cooks hack this, reaching for packets of dosa mix or adding yeast to ensure that the fermentation kicks off properly. A powerful blender is crucial to getting a fine, smooth batter. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready when it\u2019s very foamy and smells a little sour.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/tr-dosa/merlin_169211751_0af7ce84-e264-43c2-b26e-ad3baef00cc7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "20 to 25 dosa", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "snack, breads, grains and rice", "keywords": "basmati rice, fenugreek, instant yeast, jasmine rice, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 58}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups basmati or jasmine rice", "1 cup urad dal (split black gram)", "1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds", "1/2 teaspoon instant yeast", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "Ghee, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, mix the rice, dal and fenugreek.
