{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaghetti With Clams", "description": "For me, spaghetti with clams has to be ''white,'' which is to say without a tomato in sight -- and actually the first time I ate it this way was not in Italy but in one of my favorite Italian restaurants in New York, Da Silvano. This was a very long time ago, and I've been hooked ever since. I have specified amounts for a single portion here, because I feel cooking food you love is never something that should be reserved for company. Besides, this is quick and easy to make, and it's important sometimes to give yourself the treat of the perfect supper alone.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/09/dining/09COOKING-CLAMSPAGHETTI2/09COOKING-CLAMSPAGHETTI2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, pastas", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, clams, pasta, seafood", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 617}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 825, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "92 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "782 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "8 to 12 littleneck or other small clams in the shell, scrubbed", "1/4 pound spaghetti", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 to 1 clove garlic, minced", "1/2 dried red chili pepper or 1/4 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes", "1/3 cup Noilly Prat or other vermouth or white wine", "1 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
