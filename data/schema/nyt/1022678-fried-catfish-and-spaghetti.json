{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Catfish and Spaghetti", "description": "Spaghetti in a hearty tomato sauce accompanies this tender, flaky fish, coated in crisp cornmeal in this Southern dish. It\u2019s often paired with potato salad, and linked to the Deep South and the Midwest. But the recipe developer Millie Peartree grew up eating it in New York, where her mother, Millie Bell, who is from Savannah, Ga., would serve it as part of Friday night fish fries. This recipe calls for catfish, but whiting or flounder would also work well. Just make sure to look for a cornmeal that\u2019s not extra fine for the crispiest fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/22/dining/mp-fish-spaghetti/merlin_195504750_11058cf5-8dec-48c8-a656-c651004106c0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "pastas, seafood, main course", "keywords": "catfish, spaghetti, tomato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup buttermilk", "1 teaspoon yellow or Dijon mustard", "2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 teaspoons black pepper", "2 pounds catfish fillets, cut crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips", "6 cups vegetable oil, for frying", "1 1/2 cups fine cornmeal", "1/2 cup all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound ground beef or turkey, or ground Italian sausage", "1 cup chopped onion (from 1 medium onion)", "1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper (from 1/2 medium pepper)", "1 teaspoon seasoned salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 (15-ounce) cans tomato sauce", "1 (15-ounce) can crushed tomatoes with their juices", "1/4 cup low-sodium or unsalted chicken stock", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce", "1 tablespoon Italian seasoning", "1 teaspoon parsley leaves, chopped, plus more for serving", "1 teaspoon basil leaves, chopped, plus more for serving", "1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt", "1 pound dry spaghetti"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Marinate the catfish: In a medium bowl, mix together buttermilk, mustard, salt and pepper.
