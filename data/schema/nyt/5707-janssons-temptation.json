{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jansson's Temptation", "description": "Jansson's Temptation was not created in Sweden at all, but in this country, Craig Claiborne found. The splendid dish, which is not unlike a casserole, is made with potatoes that have been cut into julienne strips and blended with anchovy fillets or sprats, plus cream and onions.\n\nAs the story goes, it was named after a 19th-century Swedish religious leader, Erik Janson, who brought his followers from Sweden to America and founded a community called Bishop Hill in Illinois. Janson preached staunchly against the pleasures of the flesh and appetite but had a weakness - a particular potato-and-anchovy dish. He was discovered devouring the dish so ravenously that it ruined his reputation. Claiborne said the story is probably apocryphal (even the spelling of the name is different).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Craig Claiborne"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 or more servings", "recipeCuisine": "scandinavian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 256, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "478 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 or 6 Idaho potatoes, about 2 pounds", "1 can, 3 1/2 ounces, anchovy fillets or sprats (available where fine imported foods are sold)", "1 1/2 cups thinly sliced onions", "Freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 1/2 cups heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
