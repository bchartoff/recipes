{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sosis Bandari (Spicy Sausages and Onion)", "description": "Sosis bandari means \u201cport sausage\u201d and refers to the ports in the south of Iran, home of this delicious street food. The classic preparation combines fragrant sausages and onion cooked in a rich tomato sauce with a couple of key spices, including some type of heat. You can use any dried or fresh chile that you have on hand. This recipe calls for beef hot dogs, or franks, which are a suitable substitute for the fragrant sosis, the sausages traditionally used in this sandwich. Other versions, like this one, include creamy potatoes and green bell pepper to add bulk and to flavor the spicy and savory sausages. Serve sosis bandari as a sandwich filling on a French bun or similar type of sandwich bread, or eat it straight from the pan with bread on the side for scooping. Either way, you\u2019ll want plenty of napkins and something cold to wash it all down.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/05/dining/ND-sosis-bandari-spicy-sausage-onion/ND-sosis-bandari-spicy-sausage-onion-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "frankfurters, onion, potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 172}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "2 medium gold potatoes (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed", "12 ounces beef hot dogs (about 6), cut into 1/3-inch slices diagonally", "1 large yellow onion, quartered and thinly sliced\u00a0", "1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne or preferred ground chile, or to taste", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "6 French or submarine sandwich rolls, split and lightly toasted", "1/2 cup flat or curly parsley leaves\u00a0", "Mayonnaise, yellow mustard, sliced sour dill or other pickles, sliced tomatoes, shredded iceberg or romaine lettuce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium pot of well-salted water to a boil.
