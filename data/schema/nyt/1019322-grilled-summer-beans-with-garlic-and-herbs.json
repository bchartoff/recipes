{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Summer Beans With Garlic and Herbs", "description": "Green beans don\u2019t number among the vegetables we normally grill \u2014 eggplants, onions, peppers, zucchini \u2014 but there\u2019s something about the high, dry heat of the fire and the gentle scent of smoke that heightens their snap and natural sweetness. But how do you grill a vegetable so slender it seems doomed to fall between the bars of the grate? The secret is to use a meshed grill basket, which lets enough fire through to char the beans and enough smoke through to perfume them. The New York chef Missy Robbins grills Romano beans (a.k.a. flat or pole beans), whose shape maximizes the surface area exposed to the fire. If unavailable, substitute conventional green beans or haricots verts. The Italian inspiration for this dish is evident in the garlic, basil, mint and extra-virgin olive oil, but grilling the beans over a wood fire, instead of boiling, is uniquely and distinctly American. If necessary, you can use charcoal rather than wood; a gas grill is fine if that's what you have.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/04/dining/04woodrex2/merlin_139044186_4ab5c93c-4d18-43ec-9974-71a0c5fd35da-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, vegetables", "keywords": "basil, garlic, mint, parsley, romano beans, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 59}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 162, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "326 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3 to 5 cloves garlic, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon", "1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "2 pounds Romano beans (a.k.a. flat or pole beans) or other summer green beans, ends snapped and strings removed", "Sea salt and ground black pepper", "Leaves from 3 sprigs fresh basil", "Leaves from 3 sprigs fresh mint"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "\u00a0Build a hot wood fire in your grill.\u00a0(You can do the same with charcoal.\u00a0If you\u2019re using a gas grill, place a few hardwood chunks\u00a0under the grate over one or two of the burners.\u00a0Heat one burner on high heat and additional burners on medium heat, adjusting the heat as necessary.)
