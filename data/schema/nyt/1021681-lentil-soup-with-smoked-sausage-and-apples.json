{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lentil Soup With Smoked Sausage and Apples", "description": "Flavored with apple, sausage and mustard, t</span>his slightly creamy lentil soup strikes a nice balance between delicate and hearty. Small green lentils, or French lentils or lentils du Puy, are khaki-colored legumes that have a peppery flavor and keep their shape when cooked instead, which gives this soup an appealing texture. You can also use black lentils or easier-to-find brown lentils, but keep in mind that brown lentils will fall apart as they cook, creating a thicker stew. This soup takes only a few minutes to throw together, and most of the time is spent in hands-off simmering time, putting it within reach for a weeknight. It\u2019s never necessary to soak lentils, as they cook relatively quickly.
