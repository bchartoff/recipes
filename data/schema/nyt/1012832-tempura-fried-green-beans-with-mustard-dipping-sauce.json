{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tempura-Fried Green Beans With Mustard Dipping Sauce", "description": "The recipe for these irresistible green beans came to The Times from Jimmy Bradley, the chef and owner of the Red Cat in Manhattan. He fries green beans in a tempura batter, then serves them \u2014 hot, crunchy, with plenty of salt \u2014 aside a sweet-and-spicy mustard sauce. You\u2019ll find them on the bar, eaten as meals in themselves, and at most tables running back through the room as appetizers or side dishes. They are Buffalo chicken wings for people with good art on the wall and a capacity for avoiding, as A.J. Liebling wrote, the fatal trap of abstinence. You simply can\u2019t eat just one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/11/dining/tempura-fried-green-beans/merlin_147141264_225c0498-d37d-4efa-abfd-5cb1768289d5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, one pot", "keywords": "appetizer, club soda, green beans, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 175}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1003, "unsaturatedFatContent": "60 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "89 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "66 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1140 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 egg whites", "3 cups flour", "2 3/4 cups club soda", "About 6 cups canola oil, for frying", "1/4 cup Dijon mustard", "2 tablespoons honey", "2 teaspoons light soy sauce", "1 teaspoon hot sauce", "1 pound green beans, trimmed", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form.
