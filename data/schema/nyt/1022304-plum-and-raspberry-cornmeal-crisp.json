{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Plum and Raspberry Cornmeal Crisp", "description": "This summery fruit crisp has a bit of a savory edge thanks to crunchy cornmeal in the topping and pinches of salt. Plums and raspberries are a wonderfully sweet-tart pair, but you can use any fruit you like. Simply use a little less sugar if your fruit is particularly sweet. You can also prepare this dessert ahead to enjoy later: Make the topping (Step 3) and freeze it for up to one month. If traveling or bringing this dessert to make elsewhere, mix the dry topping ingredients in a bag and pack the remaining ingredients separately to assemble and bake at your destination.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/19/dining/ya-plum-and-raspberry-cornmeal-crisp/ya-plum-and-raspberry-cornmeal-crisp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "cornmeal, plum, raspberries", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 182}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 packed cup/100 grams light brown sugar", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "Pinch of kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "6 medium plums, chopped into 1-inch pieces (about 4 cups)", "8 ounces fresh raspberries (about 2 cups)", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 cup/128 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup/75 grams medium-grind cornmeal", "1/2 packed cup/100 grams light brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), softened", "Ice cream or whipped cream (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the filling: In an 8-inch square baking dish, combine the light brown sugar, flour and salt.
