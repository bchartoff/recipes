{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Creamy Herb Sauce", "description": "This cozy pasta is the perfect place to use up any hard-stem herbs like sage, thyme or rosemary that are languishing in your fridge. Add the herbs and a cinnamon stick to a pot of heavy cream. As they bubble together, the cream takes on a surprising but subtle herbaceousness. Use it to sauce pasta noodles and winter greens. If you don\u2019t have the herbs listed, leave them out or swap in marjoram or bay leaves, or even dried chile, lemon peel, garlic, shallot or leeks. The method of infusing cream with flavorings, then using it to sauce pasta, is open to adaptation.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/14/dining/AS-Creamy-herb-pasta/merlin_194303349_4a9bf683-ee76-4140-a206-c18571b88b78-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "heavy cream, herbs, pasta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 445}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups heavy cream", "3 sage leaves", "3 sprigs thyme or oregano", "1 small rosemary sprig", "1 cinnamon stick (or a grating of nutmeg)", "Black pepper", "1 pound linguine, fettuccine or another long noodle", "1 bunch dark leafy greens, such as kale, mustard greens, broccoli rabe or mature spinach, stems removed and cut or torn into 2- to 3-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
