{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nuitcap", "description": "A modern and decidedly French-slanted nightcap, the Nuitcap combines Cognac, blanc vermouth and a drinker\u2019s choice of bitter, herbal liqueur: Salers, g\u00e9n\u00e9py or Suze. Salers makes for a drier cocktail, while g\u00e9n\u00e9py leans sweeter and more herbal. Suze shifts the drink toward the more bitter \u2014 and bright yellow \u2014 side. A final splash of soda water is kept to a modest 1 ounce, diluting the drink, but not so much that it moves into spritz territory.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/22/dining/17dinnerrex1-nuitcap/merlin_199233654_aca2f765-50ae-4965-8c76-378c74b841fd-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "blanc vermouth, Cognac, orange liqueur", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 81}, "recipeIngredient": ["Ice", "1 ounce Cognac", "1 ounce blanc vermouth", "1/2 ounce Salers, g\u00e9n\u00e9py or Suze", "1/4 ounce orange liqueur, such as Pierre Ferrand Dry Cura\u00e7ao, Cointreau or triple sec", "1 ounce soda water, to top", "1 orange wedge or lemon peel, to garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a mixing glass with ice, and add the Cognac, vermouth, Salers and orange liqueur.
