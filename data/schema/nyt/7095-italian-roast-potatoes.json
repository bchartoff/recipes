Just cube the potatoes (don't bother to peel) and tumble them into a pan. Pour on the olive oil, sprinkle the oregano, peel the garlic cloves (you don't even have to do that if you're pushed for time), mix everything together and stick the dish in the oven. Serve alongside some lamb chops and a simple salad, or just the salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/16/dining/16COOKING-ROASTEDPOTATOES1/16COOKING-ROASTEDPOTATOES1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "garlic, olive oil, oregano, side dish, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 696}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 412, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "728 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds waxy potatoes (about 6 medium), such as Red Bliss, unpeeled and cut into 1-inch cubes", "12 cloves garlic, peeled", "2 teaspoons dried oregano", "1/4 to 1/2 cup olive oil", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
