Brian Noyes opened Red Truck bakery in 2008 on the eastern edge of Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah Valley, where plentiful local produce was part of the draw. A dose of aged apple brandy (he uses a local product, Catoctin Creek) keeps the sweetness in check, but bourbon or any aged brandy will do the job. For a nonalcoholic version, simply omit the brandy from the sauce, and swap in apple juice or cider in the cake batter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/03/dining/1applejackrex2/1applejackrex2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "apple brandy, applejack, cream cheese, egg, flour, heavy cream, pecan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 101}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream, at room temperature", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters applejack or apple brandy, plus more to taste", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "Nonstick cooking spray", "2 cups/400 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1/4 cup/55 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "2 1/2 cups/320 grams unbleached all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters whole milk", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters applejack or apple brandy", "1 cup/120 grams coarsely chopped pecans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the caramel sauce: This calls for close attention; don\u2019t wander off, but do use the time to measure out the ingredients for the cake.
