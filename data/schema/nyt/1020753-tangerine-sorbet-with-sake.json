{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tangerine Sorbet With Sake", "description": "Even people who don\u2019t want dessert can manage a bowl of fruit sorbet. This one is exceedingly easy, and makes a perfect ending to any meal. Made with fresh tangerine juice and a small amount sugar, the sorbet mixture needs a bit of alcohol to keep it from freezing solid. A little sake does the trick here, while a splash of sake at serving time adds interest. If you\u2019re not a fan of sake, use flavorless vodka in the base, and a citrus-infused vodka or citrus liqueur to finish. The alcohol gives the sorbet a softer consistency, but you can omit it if you wish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/03/dining/03tanisrex3-sorbet/merlin_166405122_0e7a5915-0f6c-4960-8d8f-ba57f7d11607-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, ice creams and sorbets", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, sake, tangerine juice, dessert, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 144}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups freshly squeezed tangerine juice, with pulp, from about 4 pounds tangerines (about 12 large)", "3/4 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 cup sake, plus more for serving", "Citrus leaves, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put tangerine juice, confectioners\u2019 sugar and 1/2 cup sake in a blender and whiz briefly to combine.
