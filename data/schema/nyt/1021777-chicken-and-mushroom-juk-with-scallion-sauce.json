{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken and Mushroom Juk With Scallion Sauce", "description": "Originally created to soothe an upset stomach, this nourishing Korean porridge has become popular as a satisfying meal no matter how you feel. The simplest juk is made with just rice and broth, but here, the addition of chicken turns the porridge into a hearty one-pot dinner. Start by poaching a whole chicken, which creates a rich chicken stock as well as juicy, tender meat. Simmer rice in the homemade broth until it breaks down, forming a creamy porridge, then add thinly sliced mushrooms for an earthy flavor. Finish with a tangy ginger-scallion sauce, which brings brightness. (You can also prepare juk in a pressure cooker with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021778\">this recipe</a>, which uses boneless, skinless chicken thighs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/20/dining/kc-stovetop-juk/merlin_182444709_38fa1c63-32a5-4c6e-9faa-7dd575a8c3a6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, poultry, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "chicken, ginger, scallion, short grain rice, spinach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 788}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup short-grain rice (about 7 1/2 ounces)", "1 whole (3 1/2- to 4-pound) chicken", "5 trimmed scallions, 3 halved crosswise and 2 finely chopped (about 1/3 cup)", "5 garlic cloves, crushed", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "3 ounces white button mushrooms, very thinly sliced (about 1 packed cup)", "1 small carrot, peeled and chopped into 1/4-inch pieces (about 1/2 cup)", "3 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "2 tablespoons white vinegar", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 ounces baby spinach (about 2 packed cups)", "Any combination of soy sauce, chile oil and hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a bowl, combine rice with enough water to cover by 2 inches.
