{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Cooker Chicken Tinga Tacos", "description": "Tinga is a Pueblan dish of braised chicken or pork in a chipotle, tomato and onion sauce, traditionally served on crisp tostadas and finished with toppings like crema, avocado and shredded lettuce. Some versions braise the meat directly in the sauce, while <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021734-tinga-de-pollo-chicken-with-chipotle-and-onions\">others</a> call for chicken or pork that\u2019s already been cooked to be warmed in the sauce. (Some variations include chorizo, too.) The dish is widely popular because it\u2019s affordable and versatile, and tastes complex even though it is easy to make. For this slow-cooker adaptation, the bulk of the cook time is hands-off braising. Fresh corn is not traditional in tinga, but it\u2019s delicious, adding pops of sweetness and a flavor that echoes the corn tortillas or tostadas. Add one chipotle for a mild spice level or three for a more intense result.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/31/dining/sd-Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Tinga-Tacos/sd-Slow-Cooker-Chicken-Tinga-Tacos-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, tacos, main course", "keywords": "chicken thigh, chipotles in adobo, corn, crushed canned tomatoes, onion, slow cooker", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2114}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1 cup crushed tomatoes, preferably fire roasted (about 9 ounces)", "5 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "1 to 3 chipotle chiles, minced, plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce (from 1 can chipotle chiles in adobo sauce)", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1 fresh or dried bay leaf", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 white or red onion, thinly sliced", "Coarse kosher salt", "Kernels cut from 2 small ears fresh corn (about 2 cups) or 10 ounces frozen, thawed corn", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "Juice of 1/2 lime (about 2 teaspoons), plus more to taste", "8 corn tortillas or tostadas", "Mexican-style crema or sour cream, for serving", "Sliced avocado, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the chicken thighs, crushed tomatoes, garlic, chipotle chiles and adobo sauce, tomato paste, vegetable oil, bay leaf, oregano, cumin and half the onion.
