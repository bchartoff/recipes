{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Confit Leeks With Lentils, Lemon and Cream", "description": "Leeks slow-cooked in olive oil star in this hearty vegetarian main of lentils, lemon and herbs. These confit leeks are roasted and softened without browning, slowly releasing their flavor into the oil. The mixture could be spooned over baked potatoes or roasted chicken, but the lentils give the dish heft and bite, and the leek cream makes it extra special. If you can\u2019t find French lentils, you can easily substitute other green or beluga lentils, or pearl barley or other grains. Serve this dish warm or at room temperature, and eat alongside some roasted potatoes for a complete meal, if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/21/dining/21Ottorex1/merlin_186367179_ceae7c52-ee8e-44f2-89ef-7447b2045ab7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "extra virgin olive oil, french green lentils, leek, lemon juice, spring, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1351}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 medium leeks (about 2 1/2 pounds/1 kilogram), trimmed and washed, white and light greens cut into 2-centimeter-thick rounds (about 6 cups/620 grams)", "10 garlic cloves, peeled", "10 fresh thyme sprigs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/200 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil", "3/4 cup/150 grams dried French (Le Puy) lentils, washed", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/100 milliliters heavy cream (double cream)", "2 1/4 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "5 tablespoons/75 milliliters fresh lemon juice (from 2 medium lemons)", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley leaves", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh dill leaves", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh tarragon leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 180 degrees Celsius/350 degrees Fahrenheit."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If necessary, soak and carefully rinse the leek rounds in a large bowl of water to get rid of any excess grit.
