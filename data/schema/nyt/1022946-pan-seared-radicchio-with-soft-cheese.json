{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Seared Radicchio With Soft Cheese", "description": "Is there a vegetable more perfectly sized for two people than a single head of radicchio? Not much bigger than a softball and wonderfully bitter, radicchio tastes otherworldly when seared briefly in a skillet, gaining a roasted kale-like savoriness while maintaining most of its crunch. A funky, strong-flavored soft cheese like Camembert or taleggio melts gloriously in the hot pan and, with a bit of sherry vinegar and honey, creates a makeshift dressing. This easy but luxurious recipe proves that you don\u2019t need much for a stellar appetizer: just a pan, a few ingredients and a hunk of crusty bread to sop up the salty, bittersweet juices.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/09/dining/04fortworex-radicchio-cheese-honey/04for-tworex-radicchio-cheese-honey-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "for two, quick, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "camembert, honey, radicchio, sherry vinegar, valentine\u2019s day, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 215}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 head radicchio (8 to 10 ounces)\u00a0", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Salt and black pepper", "4 ounces Camembert, Brie or taleggio cheese, cut into wedges or large chunks", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon honey", "Crusty bread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Quarter the radicchio head lengthwise and slice the hard white core off of each piece, then cut each quarter in half crosswise.
