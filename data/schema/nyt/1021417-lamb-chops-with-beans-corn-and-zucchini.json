A delightful accompaniment is a seasonal vegetable stew of fresh green beans, corn and summer squash. For the best marriage of flavors, cook the vegetables until rather soft. The chops get no sauce; the vegetables are finished with a little gremolata, in this case a mixture of parsley, scallions and lemon zest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/16/dining/11Tanisrex2-lamb/merlin_176678610_abbd30ca-141a-4c91-837c-131216876f6e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, main course", "keywords": "corn, garlic, green beans, lamb, rosemary, sage, zucchini, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 118}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds lamb chops (you\u2019ll want 2 or 3 chops per person)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 or 3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced", "1/4 cup roughly chopped rosemary", "1/4 cup roughly chopped sage", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 pound zucchini and summer squash, diced in large cubes", "2 cups corn kernels (from 2 large ears)", "1/2 pound green beans, or a mix of green beans and Romano beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch lengths", "3 scallions, finely sliced, both white and green parts", "1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley, leaves and tender stems", "Zest of 1 lemon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Generously season lamb chops with salt and pepper, garlic, rosemary and sage.
