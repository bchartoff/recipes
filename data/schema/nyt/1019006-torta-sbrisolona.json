The dough is quickly mixed in a food processor \u2014 whir just until you\u2019ve got a bowl full of morsels; you don\u2019t want a smooth dough \u2014 and then you pinch off nuggets of the dough and press them lightly into the pan. It\u2019s as if you were baking a pan full of streusel.\u00a0 You can cut the big cookie into individual pieces or put it out whole and let everyone break off chunks \u2014 messy, but fun.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/26/dining/26cooking-torta/26cooking-torta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "Make about 16 individual cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "almond flour, yellow cornmeal, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 45}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 127, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "38 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup (102 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup (50 grams) almond flour", "1/3 cup (57 grams) yellow cornmeal", "1/3 cup (67 grams) sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "5 1/2 tablespoons (77 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into small chunks", "1 large egg yolk, lightly beaten", "1/3 cup (50 grams) unblanched whole almonds, very coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to 325 degrees.
