{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Frijoles Borrachos (Drunken Beans)", "description": "The method of cooking beans with beer originated in northern Mexico (Monterrey is the country\u2019s brewery capital), then traveled with the cowboys on cattle drives. It\u2019s easy to imagine a cauldron of beans simmering over a fire, the cook tossing in bits of meat from the grill, then pouring in beer to cover the beans, which might have been more convenient than water.

Abrams, 1986) </span><span>by Patricia Quintana, the food of northern Mexico is often associated with grilled meats, but it is also epitomized by spicy beans like frijoles charros (or </span><a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017495-simple-pinto-beans\"><span>cowboy beans</span></a><span>) and drunken beans. Bacon (or Mexican chorizo or other fatty meats) provide a rich base in which to cook vegetables like onions and peppers, while the beer makes the beans brighter and sharper but not boozy. Eat a bowl with grilled meats, flour tortillas or solo.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/17/multimedia/as-drunken-beans-jgmc/as-drunken-beans-jgmc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, main course, side dish", "keywords": "bacon, beer, jalape\u00f1o, make-ahead, pinto beans, plan-ahead, poblano, serrano", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 360}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried pinto beans", "5 slices thick-cut bacon, thinly sliced crosswise", "1 large yellow or white onion, coarsely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, chopped", "2 jalape\u00f1o, serrano or poblano peppers, seeded and coarsely chopped\u00a0", "Handful of cilantro sprigs, stems finely chopped and leaves left whole", "2 medium to large tomatoes, coarsely chopped", "Salt\u00a0", "12 ounces light or dark Mexican beer (1 bottle or can)\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, cover the beans with plenty of water and soak for 8 to 12 hours.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "When ready to cook, in a large Dutch oven or pot, add the bacon, set over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, 5 to 8 minutes.
