{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken M\u2019Hammer", "description": "M'hammer is a classic way of preparing tagine in Morocco in which roasted chicken legs are doused in a savory and lightly sweet sauce made of onions, paprika, cumin and turmeric. M\u2019hammer, which means both reddish and grilled in Moroccan, refers to the ingredients as well as the way the dish is cooked. A generous amount of paprika is used in the marinade, giving it a brownish red color, and the chicken legs are cooked in the sauce, then charred under the broiler. Keep in mind that the color of your sauce will vary depending on the provenance and freshness of your spices. Serve this tagine with your side of choice: Bread would be the most traditional way to enjoy this deeply comforting dish, but couscous, rice or steamed greens would also work beautifully.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nargisse Benkabbou"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/15/dining/nb-chicken-tagine-mhammer/nb-chicken-tagine-mhammer-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken leg, ground cumin, ground turmeric, sweet paprika, yellow onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 128}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil\u00a0", "3 garlic cloves, grated", "2 teaspoons sweet paprika", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric\u00a0", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "4 chicken leg quarters (about 2 1/2 pounds total)", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 large yellow onions, cut into \u00bc-inch pieces", "1/2 cup vegetable or chicken stock\u00a0", "1 tablespoon toasted sliced almonds, optional\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the marinade: To a large mixing bowl, add the olive oil, garlic, paprika, cumin, turmeric, salt and black pepper and stir until well combined.
