{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Candied Fruitcake", "description": "I discovered that candied fruit likes getting soused with currants or dates, and that it isn't fussy about the medium: sherry, rum or Cognac all make it happy. And the trick to baking with it is simple: use the good stuff and use it judiciously. Fold just enough diced peel and choice cherries into a batter with chopped dates and spice and watch the tone and texture lighten up. No one would dream of calling this fruitcake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Rentschler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/19/dining/19COOKING-FRUITCAKE/19COOKING-FRUITCAKE-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cake, candied fruit, dessert, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 15}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 305, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "214 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups chopped pitted dates", "1/4 cup chopped candied citron (more for decorating)", "1/4 cup chopped candied orange peel (more for decorating)", "1/4 cup chopped candied lemon peel (more for decorating)", "1/4 cup candied cherries (more for decorating)", "1/2 cup hot brewed coffee, preferably espresso", "1/4 cup Cognac", "12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature (more for greasing pan)", "3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon ground mace", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 cup dark brown sugar", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 large eggs", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine dates and candied fruit in a small bowl; pour coffee and brandy over them, and stir to combine.
