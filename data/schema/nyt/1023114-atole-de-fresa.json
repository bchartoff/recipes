Dry masa harina, which is easier to find than fresh, is used here to thicken and flavor the drink, so be sure to use a good-quality variety. This recipe is finished off with strawberries for an even sweeter version with a pink hue. Freeze-dried strawberries blended to a powder or ripe in-season strawberries will give just the right amount of sweet fruity flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/06/dining/jr-atole-de-fresa/jr-atole-de-fresa-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4\u00a0servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "masa harina, soy milk, strawberries, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups unsweetened plant-based milk, plus more as needed", "2/3 cup raw turbinado sugar, or 5 ounces piloncillo (grated or broken into small pieces)", "Pinch of salt", "2/3 cup dried masa harina", "2 cups hot water", "6 tablespoons strawberry powder (made from blending freeze-dried strawberries) or 4 ounces fresh, in-season strawberries", "1 teaspoon dehydrated beet powder, for color (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the milk, sugar (or piloncillo) and salt in a small pot and over medium-low.
