The highlight of the condiment is belacan, fermented shrimp paste, which lends an aromatic pungency. This popular hot sauce, accented with makrut lime leaf, is slung over noodles, stuffed into fried mackerel, or used as a dip for crispy prawn crackers. This recipe is adapted from food writer Sharon Wee\u2019s cookbook, \u201cGrowing Up in a Nonya Kitchen.\u201d Ms. Wee, who is Peranakan (an ethnic group with mixed Malay, Chinese and European heritage), said in her book that no Peranakan woman \u201cwould be worth her salt if she could not concoct this at home.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clarissa Wei"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/26/dining/21SINGAPOREREX2-sambal-belacan/merlin_200287422_86dbe898-26ca-49f1-8a6e-4a36c9c11ff3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "Makes about 1/4 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 46}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 ounce/15 grams <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Belacan-Shrimp-Paste-Product-Malaysia/dp/B00X95VKXO\">belacan</a>, also known as dried shrimp paste (about \u00bc-inch slice; see Tip)", "3 Holland chiles or other fresh red chiles", "1 fresh makrut lime leaf, stem and rib removed", "1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more to taste", "Salt (optional)\u00a0", "2 calamansi limes or 1 regular lime, quartered\u00a0\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Belacan has an intense aroma, so it is best to open a window or turn on the stove\u2019s exhaust fan to its highest setting when toasting it.
