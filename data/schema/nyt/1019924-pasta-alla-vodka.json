Adding pancetta brings a salty smokiness, but if you leave it out, you\u2019re still in for a quick and flavorful dish. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious, the pasta is delightful with Caesar salad or garlic bread, but it\u2019s also satisfying enough to take centerstage. Put on some Puccini, open up a bottle of red and you\u2019re guaranteed a more relaxed dining experience than the one you might get at the local red-and-white checkered-tablecloth joint.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/dining/ch-pasta-alla-vodka/merlin_145792752_fabec26c-908c-4f71-8c84-2b145849da43-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "crushed canned tomatoes, pancetta, pasta, vodka, fall, spring, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1266}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 562, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "691 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 pound rigatoni or penne pasta", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "4 ounces diced pancetta, optional", "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "3/4 cup vodka", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes", "Freshly ground black pepper", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "1/4 cup grated Grana Padano or Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh oregano", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped Italian parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (2 heaping tablespoons kosher salt to about 7 quarts water).
