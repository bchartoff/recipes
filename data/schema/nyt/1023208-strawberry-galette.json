{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Galette", "description": "A strawberry galette served with a side of fresh whipped cream or ice cream is a spring salve that is just as soothing to prepare for oneself as it is to share with others. Inspired by the baker Alice Medrich\u2019s yogurt-butter pie dough, the dough in this recipe includes almond flour for a flaky, subtly nutty crust that comes together without much fuss. This dough is very forgiving and works well with the rustic charm of a galette. It\u2019s OK if the edges of the crust crack and some juices leak. Even out-of-season strawberries would work, as there\u2019s just enough sugar here to coax them back to life. Make sure you give the galette enough time to rest before slicing into it, so that the juices have time to set.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Naz Deravian"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/20/dining/nd-strawberry-galette/merlin_206514768_d6616c67-27f9-44ef-afd0-c1506bf54c20-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "almond flour, strawberries, yogurt, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 506}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/120 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/2 cup/50 grams almond flour (from blanched, skinless almonds, not almond meal)", "8 tablespoons/113 grams very cold unsalted butter", "1/4 cup/60 grams cold plain whole yogurt (not Greek)", "1 tablespoon ice-cold water, plus up to 3 tablespoons more, if needed", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon yogurt or water (for the egg wash)", "1/2 to 3/4 cup/100 grams to 150 grams granulated sugar", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 1/2 pounds stemmed strawberries (about 5 cups), sliced", "3 tablespoons cornstarch", "Small pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whisk the all-purpose flour and the almond flour in a large bowl, then set aside.
