Pack it in a lunchbox with celery and crackers for your kids. Or, zip it up with a dash or two of Tabasco and some mashed garlic, spoon it into a bowl surrounded by good potato chips and serve it with cocktails to the adults. It will keep for at least five days in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/dining/clark-cheddar-scallion-dip/clark-cheddar-scallion-dip-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, snack, dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, cheddar, mayonnaise, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 631}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 332, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "338 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ounces cream cheese (at room temperature), cubed", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1 scallion, thinly sliced", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste", "Black pepper, to taste (optional)", "1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika", "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice, as needed", "1/2 cup sharp Cheddar, finely grated", "1 small garlic clove, mashed to a paste (optional)", "Hot sauce to taste (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the cream cheese, mayonnaise, scallion, salt, pepper (if using) and paprika in a bowl and mix and mash well with a fork or spatula until smooth.
