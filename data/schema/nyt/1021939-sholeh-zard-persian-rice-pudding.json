{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sholeh Zard (Persian Rice Pudding)", "description": "This cozy dessert from Sara Mardanbigi and Edgar Rico, the owners of Nixta Taqueria in Austin, Texas, is a take on sholeh zard, a loose, heavily spiced Persian rice pudding Ms. Mardanbigi grew up eating. It also borrows influence from the Mexican arroz con leche of Mr. Rico\u2019s childhood. Their take is warm and smoky with black cardamom and saffron, velvety from egg yolks and butter, and has a savory finish. It calls for arborio rice instead of the usual basmati to add a slight chew, and strawberry powder instead of rosewater to provide similar floral notes with a punch of acid.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/03/dining/26ricepuddingrex1/26ricepuddingrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "arborio rice, freeze-dried strawberries, heavy cream, pistachio, saffron", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 609}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup arborio rice, unrinsed", "3 cups whole milk", "1 cup heavy cream", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean (see Notes)", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 black cardamom pod (see Notes)", "1 tablespoon ground turmeric", "2 saffron threads, preferably Persian, ground then stirred into 1 tablespoon water", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes", "2 large egg yolks", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 cup freeze-dried strawberries, finely ground", "1/2 cup coarsely chopped roasted salted pistachios", "Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring 4 cups of water to a hard boil in a Dutch oven or other large pot over high heat.
