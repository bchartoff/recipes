{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef Stew With Prunes", "description": "Braised dishes like this beef stew may feature green, orange, yellow or red vegetables but their most appetizing color is brown, the shade of brown whose glossy darkness shouts intensity and richness. The key to achieving that glorious color and flavor is sufficient browning of the meat. Don't rush. The good thing is, this savory-sweet stew can almost be ignored while it is cooking and can be made in advance, the night \u2013 or even two \u2013 before you serve it. Couscous makes a great accompaniment, as does saffron rice, because those bring out the color of the stew. Plain crusty bread is another great option. This is simple cold weather food at its most appealing.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/20/dining/20COOKING-BEEFPRUNESTEW1/20COOKING-BEEFPRUNESTEW1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "beef stew meat, prune, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 679}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 612, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1134 milligrams", "sugarContent": "27 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "2 pounds lean boneless beef, preferably chuck, in 2-inch cubes", "Salt and pepper to taste", "1 onion, peeled and chopped", "3 plum tomatoes, stemmed and chopped (canned are fine)", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika, more to taste", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 bay leaf", "1 cup chicken stock", "1 cup dry red wine", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1 cup pitted prunes", "1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or other vinegar, or to taste", "Chopped parsley leaves for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a deep skillet or casserole that can be covered over medium-high heat, and add oil.
