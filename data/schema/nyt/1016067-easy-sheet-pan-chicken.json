{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Easy Sheet-Pan Chicken", "description": "Crisp-skinned and very juicy, this is a more sophisticated version of the crumb-coated, oven-fried chicken dishes of childhood. In addition to bread crumbs, the chicken is slathered with two kinds of mustard plus fresh thyme and minced garlic, which makes it deeply flavored, bright and complex. And because it calls for only one pan, clean up is minimal. While the recipe calls for bone-in drumsticks and/or thighs, if you prefer boneless white meat, feel free to substitute it, reducing the cooking time by 5 to 10 minutes. Serve this with potatoes  \u2013 either sweet or white \u2013 and your favorite green vegetable or salad. It\u2019s weeknight cooking at its finest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/31/multimedia/clark-roasted-chicken/clark-roasted-chicken-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, poultry", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1454}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 861, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "61 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "59 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "879 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons whole-grain mustard", "2 teaspoons chopped thyme leaves", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "3 pounds bone-in chicken thighs or drumsticks (or a mixture), patted dry", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "2/3 cup plain dried bread crumbs", "Olive oil, for drizzling"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
