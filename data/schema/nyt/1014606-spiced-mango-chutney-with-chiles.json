{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiced Mango Chutney With Chiles", "description": "Chutneys are often made with unripe or dried fruit; they always include vinegar, sugar and spices. This recipe, with ripe fruit, offers a two-toned flavor: sweet and tropical offset by sultry spices and the heat of chilies. It\u2019s welcome in a grilled-cheese sandwich, stirred into mayonnaise or yogurt for a quick dip or spread, or alongside any curry or daal.\n\nThere are thousands of varieties of mangoes, but two are predominant. The Tommy Atkin is green, blushed with rose, and as large as a softball. The champagne mango, the size of a large peach, is pale gold, with a floral flavor. I prefer the champagne, which tends to be less fibrous and has an impossibly lovely scent, but any mango is a boon. The fruit is full of such promise.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Cathy Barrow"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/20/dining/20TROPICAL2/20TROPICAL2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "5 half-pint jars (5 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "mango, onion, raisins, spring, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 58}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 441, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "27 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "30 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 pounds mangoes, about 9 Champagne or 6 Tommy Atkins", "1 cup, or 7 ounces, golden raisins (or dried cranberries, cherries or apricots)", "1 cup apple cider vinegar", "1 cup, or 7 ounces, brown sugar", "1/2 cup finely minced onion", "1/4 cup peeled, finely minced fresh ginger", "1 teaspoon yellow mustard seed", "1 teaspoon coriander seed", "6 cardamom pods, seeds extracted", "6 Kaffir lime leaves", "1 4-inch Chinese long red hot chile, or to taste", "1 4-inch serrano chile, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel and dice the mangoes to yield 5 cups, or 2 pounds 4 ounces."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a rack or a folded kitchen towel in a large pot, fill with water and bring to a boil.
