{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tom Yum Soup With Tofu and Vermicelli", "description": "Tom yum is a hot and sour soup from Thailand with lively notes of lemongrass, makrut lime leaves and galangal. There are many variations of this iconic soup, including tom kha (coconut milk and dominant galangal notes), tom yum pla (fish) and tom yum gai (chicken). This version is vegetarian, hence not traditional, but it is reminiscent of tom yum koong nam khon, a creamy version that uses canned evaporated milk. (Use coconut milk if you prefer). Tom yum is often moored by nam prik pao, a staple Thai chile paste of roasted chiles, shrimp paste and fish sauce, but in this recipe, a combination of soy sauce, lime, garlic and sambal oelek provides a similar umami kick. The addition of vermicelli and tofu is also unconventional, but it turns this soup into a hearty, quick and comforting weeknight dinner.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/05/dining/hm-HM-tom-yum-noodle-soup/merlin_194895192_f6466260-e7fd-4c56-bfdf-014b032233a6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "thai", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "lemongrass, makrut lime leaf, sambal oelek, silken tofu, soup, vermicelli, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 971}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces rice or mung bean vermicelli", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons lime juice (from 1 lime)", "1 tablespoon sambal oelek", "1 garlic clove, grated", "1 stalk lemongrass, cut into 2-inch sections and crushed", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger or galangal, peeled and finely sliced", "2 makrut lime leaves, finely sliced", "4 cups vegetable stock", "4 to 6 shiitake mushrooms (4 ounces), stemmed and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "6 cherry or grape tomatoes, halved", "1 16-ounce package silken tofu, broken into 5 or 6 large chunks", "2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 cup evaporated milk (optional)", "2 scallions, finely sliced", "Handful of cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the vermicelli in room temperature water for 10 minutes, until they have softened.
