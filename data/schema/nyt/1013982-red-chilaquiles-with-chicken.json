{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red Chilaquiles With Chicken", "description": "Chilaquiles is a sort of top-of-the-stove tortilla casserole. In its simplest form, it consists of a freshly made salsa into which you stir fried tortillas. Sometimes eggs are added, and sometimes chicken as well. The salsa can be red or green; even thick black beans may be used. I favor microwave-toasted tortillas, but if you don\u2019t have the time, use baked tortilla chips. Serve this right after you\u2019ve stirred in the tortilla chips, because if they\u2019re not fried, they will quickly become soggy.
