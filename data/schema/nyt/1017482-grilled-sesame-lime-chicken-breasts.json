{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Sesame Lime Chicken Breasts", "description": "Brining chicken breasts in a soy sauce and fish sauce marinade flecked with lime adds flavor and helps retain moisture while they are on the grill. Chicken breasts do particularly well when pounded into an even thickness and cooked quickly over a hot fire, which chars the exterior but keeps them juicy inside. But if you or anyone in your clan would prefer dark meat to white, this recipe will also work with boneless, skinless thighs, though you might have to add a minute or so to the cooking time. Or use a combination of breasts and thighs. Serve these with a <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015023-cucumber-salad-with-asian-flavors\">cucumber salad</a> and <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013779-grilled-eggplant-salad\">grilled eggplant</a> in the heart of summer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/27/dining/grilled-sesame-lime-chicken2/grilled-sesame-lime-chicken2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, barbecues", "keywords": "chicken breast, fish sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 942}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 323, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "755 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["<span></span>", "4 (6-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 teaspoons Asian-style fish sauce", "1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeled and grated", "3 garlic cloves, grated", "2 limes, as needed", "2 tablespoons peanut oil, more for grill", "Sesame oil, as needed", "Coarsely chopped cilantro, for garnish", "Thinly sliced red or green chilies, seeded, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place chicken breasts between two sheets of parchment or plastic wrap.
