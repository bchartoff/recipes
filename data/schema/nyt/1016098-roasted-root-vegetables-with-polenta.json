{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Root Vegetables With Polenta", "description": "In this comforting, perfect winter dinner I roast the vegetables and make the polenta in the oven at the same time. To accommodate the temperature requirements of each element of the dish, I use a slightly higher temperature than I usually use for polenta and I roast the vegetables at a lower temperature for longer. I top the polenta with a ladleful of marinara sauce, and spoon the vegetables on top. You could serve the polenta with only the roasted vegetables as well, so I have made the marinara sauce optional.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/04/science/04recipehealth/04recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, winter, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 280}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 264, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "859 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large carrots (3/4 to 1 pound), peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces (quarter at the fat ends, cut in half at the thin ends, then cut in thick slices)", "1 large parsnip (about 1/2 pound), quartered, cored and cut in 3/4-inch pieces", "1 medium-size fennel bulb, quartered, cored and cut in 3/4 inch pieces", "1 medium or large red onion, cut in large dice", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "Chopped fresh rosemary, thyme or sage, about 2 teaspoons (optional)", "1 cup polenta", "1 quart water", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan (optional but recommended)", "1 batch marinara sauce (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
