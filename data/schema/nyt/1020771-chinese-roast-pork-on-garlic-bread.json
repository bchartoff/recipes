{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chinese Roast Pork on Garlic Bread", "description": "Chinese roast pork on garlic bread is one of the great New York sandwiches, a taste of the highest peaks of Catskills cuisine: thinly sliced, Cantonese-style char siu married to Italian-American garlic bread beneath a veil of sweet-sticky duck sauce. It\u2019s been around since the 1950s, a favorite of the summertime borscht belt crowd. You can make the sandwich with store-bought char siu if you like, but I prefer the homemade variety because I can make it with fancy pork from the farmers\u2019 market. It\u2019s also juicier and more flavorful. Then, layer the meat onto garlic bread, and add a drizzle of duck sauce \u2013 for that, I use leftover packets from Chinese takeout orders or make my own with apricot preserves cut through with vinegar. Some people add a slash of hot mustard; others fresh pickles, or coleslaw. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate assimilation crossover food,\u201d the food writer and erstwhile restaurant critic Arthur Schwartz told me. \u201cThat sandwich is a symbol of acculturation.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/19/magazine/19mag-eat/19mag-eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weeknight, sandwiches", "keywords": "garlic, honey, pork, pork butt, pork shoulder, scallion, soy sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 214}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds boneless pork shoulder or butt", "1/4 cup honey", "3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce", "2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, dry sherry or sake", "2 tablespoons hoisin sauce", "1 tablespoon oyster sauce", "1 teaspoon five-spice powder", "2 jarred red fermented bean curd cubes, plus 1 tablespoon of the liquid from the jar (optional)", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened", "8 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "4 large sub rolls, not too crusty or firm, or Italian- or French-style bread, cut into 4 (6-to-8-inch) sections, split lengthwise", "1/2 cup apricot jam", "Red- or white-wine vinegar, to taste", "Chinese mustard, for serving", "1 bunch scallions, trimmed and sliced on an angle (about 1 cup), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the pork into 1-by-4-inch pieces (each about the size of a stick of butter)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the marinade: In a large bowl, whisk together the honey, soy sauce, wine, hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, five-spice powder and, if using, the bean curd and its liquid.
