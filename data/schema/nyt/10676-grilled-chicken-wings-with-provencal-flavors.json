Start them over indirect heat, away from the hottest part of the grill. Cook them there, more or less undisturbed, until most of their fat is rendered and they\u2019re just about cooked through.\n\nThis takes only 10 or 15 minutes, especially if you cut the wings into sections first (more on this in a second). At this point they\u2019ll be pale and not especially appetizing, but move them over to the hot part of the grill, brown them under a watchful eye, and they\u2019ll turn gorgeous.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/wingsvideo-still/wingsvideo-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken wings, fresh herbs, dairy-free, nut-free, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 30}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 109, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "135 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme, oregano or marjoram leaves", "1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves", "1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh lavender leaves, optional", "1/4 cup roughly chopped parsley", "Extra virgin olive oil", "8 chicken wings, cut into three sections, smallest section reserved for stock", "8 bay leaves, cut in half", "Lemon wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start a gas or charcoal grill; fire should be moderately hot and rack about 6 inches from heat source.
