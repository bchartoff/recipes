{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gyeran Bap (Egg Rice)", "description": "Gyeran bap is a lifesaving Korean pantry meal of fried eggs stirred into steamed white rice. In this version, the eggs fry and puff up slightly in a shallow bath of browned butter. Soy sauce, which reduces in the pan, seasons the rice, as does a final smattering of salty gim, or roasted seaweed. A dribble of sesame oil lends comforting nuttiness, and runny yolks act as a makeshift sauce for the rice, slicking each grain with eggy gold. (You can cook the eggs to your preferred doneness, of course.) This dinner-for-one can be scaled up to serve more: Just double, triple or quadruple all of the ingredient amounts, using a larger skillet or repeating the steps in a small one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/12/magazine/12mag-Eat-web/12mag-Eat-web-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner, easy, for one, lunch, quick, snack, grains and rice, main course", "keywords": "brown butter, egg dish, rice, sesame oil, soy sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1873}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 large eggs", "1 teaspoon soy sauce", "1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil", "1 cup steamed white rice, preferably short- or medium-grain", "1 (5-gram) packet roasted, salted seaweed, such as gim (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat.
