Fresh green herbs brighten up the salty feta, and sumac gives it another layer of flavor and a gorgeous pop of color. Choose a feta in brine over vacuum-packed, if you\u2019ve got the option. Feta varies a lot in salt content, so you won\u2019t see a measured amount of salt here; just taste the dip and add a bit if you think it needs it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/04/dining/ya-herby-feta-and-sumac-dip/ya-herby-feta-and-sumac-dip-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "6 servings (about 1 1/4 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "feta, greek yogurt, herbs, lemon, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 293}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup full-fat Greek yogurt", "3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (about 130 grams)", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions, plus more for serving", "2 teaspoons dried sumac, plus more for serving", "Salt, to taste", "Olive oil, for serving", "Pita chips or crudit\u00e9s, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the yogurt, feta and lemon juice to the bowl of a food processor.
