{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vegetable Tofu Curry", "description": "This one-pot vegetarian meal comes together quickly and leftovers keep for days. Creamy coconut milk is made up of fat and liquid from pressed coconut meat and this recipe delivers its full range of flavors. When you melt the solids from a can of coconut milk and keep cooking until the liquid evaporates, the oil eventually separates out and delivers toasty nuttiness. Here, onion \u2014 any kind \u2014 tenderizes in that tasty fat, and curry powder becomes more fragrant in it. Tofu soaks up the curry sauce while vegetables steam over the mixture, then everything gets stirred together. Experiment with whatever vegetables you have on hand, cooking them until tender.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/22/dining/21beginner-rex10/merlin_208168485_3ca79d37-0cbf-46c4-8a91-5a9a7e380360-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, curries, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "broccoli, coconut milk, curry powder, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 987}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 broccoli heads, 8 ounces green beans or 2 cups frozen peas, or a combination", "1 (14- to 16-ounce) container firm tofu", "1 (13.5-ounce) can coconut milk", "1 medium onion, chopped", "Salt and pepper", "1 tablespoon curry powder, plus more to taste", "Cooked rice or other grains or noodles, for serving", "Hot sauce, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using broccoli, trim the ends of the stems and discard, then cut the stems off near the base of the florets.
