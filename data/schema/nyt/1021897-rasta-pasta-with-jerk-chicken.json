{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rasta Pasta With Jerk Chicken", "description": "Comforting and spicy in just the right way, Rasta pasta is popular in Jamaican communities across New York and beyond. This version gets its spice from jerk seasoning and a single Scotch bonnet. The bell peppers and green onions add not only texture, but a sweet crunch and brightness. You could swap salmon or shrimp for the chicken, or use fettuccine or rigatoni instead of the penne, if you like; just mind the cooking time. You could even halve the heavy cream, or substitute coconut milk for more depth of flavor. Feel free to refrigerate any leftovers, and either reheat or eat them cold the next day. This is a dish that gets better with a little time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Millie Peartree"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/11/dining/mp-rasta-pasta/merlin_183521775_ac3a7f41-6c1d-4955-aba2-661a693fb66b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas, main course", "keywords": "bell pepper, chicken breast, green onion, jerk seasoning", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 973}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons jerk seasoning", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 teaspoon smoked paprika", "2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound penne pasta", "3 bell peppers, preferably a mix of colors, thinly sliced", "4 green onions, sliced, plus more for garnish", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 cup jerk seasoning", "2 fresh thyme sprigs", "1 Scotch bonnet pepper, pierced, not sliced (optional)", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1/4 cup vegetable or chicken stock", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chicken: In a medium bowl, combine jerk seasoning, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic powder and smoked paprika.
