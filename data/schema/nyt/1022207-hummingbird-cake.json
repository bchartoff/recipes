{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hummingbird Cake", "description": "This super-simple tropical cake contains a hefty amount of mashed bananas and crushed pineapple. Often associated with the American South, where it is believed to have adopted a cream cheese frosting, it most likely originated in Jamaica, where it was called a Doctor Bird Cake. (\u201cDoctor bird\u201d is the nickname of Jamaica\u2019s national bird, the red-billed streamertail hummingbird.) Some say this cake is sweet enough to attract even hummingbirds, while others say the name derives from how bananas, a key ingredient in the cake, resemble the bird\u2019s beak. The end result tastes similar to banana bread, but with the moistness and flavor of a spice-filled carrot cake.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/07/dining/vl-hummingbird-cake/vl-hummingbird-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "snack, cakes, dessert", "keywords": "banana, cream cheese, jamaican, layer cake, pecan, pineapple, kwanzaa", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1332}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick baking spray", "3 3/4 cups/480 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams overripe mashed bananas (about 3 bananas)", "1 packed cup/220 grams dark brown sugar", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/240 milliliters vegetable oil", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "2 (8-ounce/227-gram) cans crushed pineapple in juice (about 1 3/4 cups)", "3/4 cup/85 grams chopped toasted pecan halves", "2 (8-ounce/226-gram) packages cream cheese, at room temperature", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature", "7 1/3 cups/905 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "4 teaspoons vanilla extract", "Heaping 3/4 cup/85 grams toasted pecan halves, for garnish", "Dried pineapple rings and edible flowers, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
