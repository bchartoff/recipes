{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eggplant Parmesan Pasta", "description": "The unassuming eggplant is the star of this comforting weeknight pasta that manages to capture the flavors of traditional eggplant Parmigiana without the fuss of frying, layering and baking. Cubed eggplant is browned with onion and garlic until golden, then simmered in a quick pantry-friendly tomato sauce until meltingly tender. Mezze rigatoni, fusilli and shells all do great jobs of capturing the thick sauce. The pasta is finished with slivers of fresh mozzarella that soften and offer cool, creamy bites, and a final sprinkling of a Parmesan bread-crumb topping offers familiar moments of crunch to contrast the creamy sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/05/dining/kc-eggplant-parmesan-pasta/kc-eggplant-parmesan-pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "eggplant, pasta, tomato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1632}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "3/4 cup panko bread crumbs", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion (from 1 small onion)", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 1/2 pounds eggplant, peeled and cut into \u00bd-inch cubes (8 cups)", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, crushed with your hands in a bowl", "1 basil sprig, plus \u2153 cup coarsely chopped basil leaves", "1/4 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 pound short pasta, such as mezze rigatoni, fusilli or shells", "2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano", "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced and at room temperature"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a high-sided large (12-inch) skillet with a lid, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium.
