Served over toast, they make for a simple yet indulgent breakfast, or anytime snack. This dish is inspired by a recipe in \"Roast Chicken and Other Stories.\" In the book, Simon Hopkinson writes that his version was inspired by Edouard de Pomiane\u2019s \"Cooking in 10 Minutes.\" Hopkinson bakes fresh tomatoes in garlicky, minty cream for half an hour. The version below, with canned tomatoes, woody herbs and a hint of cinnamon, is there for you when fresh tomatoes aren\u2019t \u2014 and, like de Pomiane's approach, takes closer to 10 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/dining/AS-creamed-tomatoes-on-toast/merlin_149237013_a38dcb9c-5b39-4230-9244-da2292b2d5c8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, weekday, vegetables", "keywords": "canned tomatoes, cinnamon stick, heavy cream, sourdough, main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 96}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "672 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup heavy cream", "2 fresh thyme or oregano sprigs, or 1 fresh or dried bay leaf", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "4 slices sourdough or rustic country bread, toasted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small saucepan, bring the cream, thyme and cinnamon stick to a simmer over medium-low heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "As cream comes to a simmer, drain the tomatoes (no need to rinse), discarding the juices.
