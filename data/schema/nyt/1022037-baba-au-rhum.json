{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baba au Rhum", "description": "A classic French dessert, baba au rhum is a syrup-soaked, soggy, boozy delight. The dough here is intentionally soft and sticky, for a light, tender result. Be sparing in adding flour, incorporating just enough to make it manageable, or refrigerate the dough, then work with it. (Chilled dough is easier to handle.) This recipe yields a dozen babas, but you can bake them all and soak only as many as you intend to serve. You can freeze any baked, unsoaked babas for up to 2 months, then prepare them a day in advance and keep them in an airtight container at room temperature.\u00a0Any leftover syrup keeps indefinitely in the fridge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/07/dining/02Tanisrex-baba/merlin_185804565_0b54b8bb-90a7-4361-8d25-ecb91d4403b5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "12 small babas", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "cakes, quick breads, dessert", "keywords": "cardamom, cinnamon, flour, golden raisins, honey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 275}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons active dry yeast", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "4 large eggs, beaten", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/2 cup/113 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), softened, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "1/2 cup/80 grams golden raisins, soaked in hot water and drained", "1/2 cup honey", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 (2-inch) cinnamon stick", "3 whole cloves", "3 green cardamom pods", "Zest of 1 large orange, removed in strips with a vegetable peeler", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters dark rum, brandy or whiskey, plus more for serving", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: Put yeast and sugar in a medium bowl and stir in \u00bc cup lukewarm water.
