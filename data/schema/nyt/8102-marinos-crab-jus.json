The beer will foam, and when the foam dies down, continue to boil for 1 more minute. Add the beer and butter to the garlic mixture and mix well. Arrange the crabs in layers in their cooking pot and cover with the beer mixture. Shake the pan to get the liquid into the crabs. Bring to a boil, quickly lower the heat and simmer the crabs for 7 minutes, shaking the pan to jolt the juice out of the crabs. Do not overcook or the meat will get mushy. Remove the crabs. Serve with linguine below."}]}
