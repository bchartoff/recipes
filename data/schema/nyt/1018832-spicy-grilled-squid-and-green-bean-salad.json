{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Grilled Squid and Green Bean Salad", "description": "Everyone loves calamari, but grilling is an easy, delicious alternative to frying. Grill the squid whole, then slice it into rings to serve warm or at room temperature, dressed with an assertive vinaigrette \u2014 in this case, with ginger, hot pepper, sesame oil and scallions. Cooking over hot coals adds a smoky note, but a stovetop grill works well, too. Any size squid may be prepared this way, but meaty larger squid works best. And, if grilling isn't a possibility, whole squid can also be broiled or roasted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/12/dining/12kitchen1/12kitchen1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, cilantro, green beans, jalape\u00f1o, scallion, squid, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 51}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 283, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "21 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "670 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound large squid, whole bodies (tubes) and tentacles, cleaned\u00a0(about 8)\u00a0", "Salt and pepper", "3 to 4 tablespoons peanut oil or other vegetable oil", "2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil", "3 tablespoons lime juice or rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce or 2 teaspoons finely chopped anchovy", "1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 jalape\u00f1o chile, seeds removed to lessen heat if desired, chopped or thinly sliced", "1 red Fresno chile, seeds removed to lessen heat, chopped or thinly sliced", "1 pound tender green beans or Romano beans, ends trimmed (topped and tailed)", "1/2 cup slivered scallions, both white and green parts", "1 small bunch cilantro, leaves and tender stems roughly chopped, plus a few sprigs reserved for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse squid with cold water, drain and pat dry.
