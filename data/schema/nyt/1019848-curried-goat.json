{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Curried Goat", "description": "To Hazel Craig, the mother of the pastry chef Jessica Craig, it\u2019s not Christmas without curried goat, a hearty, spicy dish that\u2019s often served during the holidays in Hazel\u2019s native Jamaica. The star ingredient here is the Jamaican curry powder blend. It\u2019s worth making your own to maximize the dish\u2019s depth and complexity, and the recipe here makes extra (which can be used in any kind of stew or braise). Hazel insists that the best way to prepare goat is not to brown the meat first, but to cook everything all at once in the same pot. \u201cWhen you heat everything up together,\u201d she said, all the flavor \u201cgets locked in there.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/19/dining/19jamaicanrex3/merlin_147982983_dc2e1113-2ae5-4afe-a79f-24ba5990276d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT14H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "goat, lawry's seasoned salt, russet potatoes, scotch bonnet chile, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 62}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 339, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "565 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons cumin seeds", "4 tablespoons coriander seeds", "2 tablespoons ground turmeric", "1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds", "1 tablespoon ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon garlic powder", "2 teaspoons onion powder", "2 teaspoons ground allspice", "3 pounds boneless goat meat, such as shoulder or leg, cut into 2-inch cubes", "1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil", "1 large white onion, sliced", "6 garlic cloves, minced", "1 Scotch bonnet chile, sliced, seeds removed", "3 fresh thyme sprigs", "2 teaspoons Lawry\u2019s Seasoned Salt, plus more if needed", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "3 medium russet potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1-inch pieces", "Cooked white rice, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the Jamaican curry powder: In a skillet, toast the spices over low heat, gently shaking the pan, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
