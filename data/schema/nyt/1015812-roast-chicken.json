{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Chicken", "description": "With an ingredient list just four items long (chicken, olive oil, salt, pepper), the genius of this bare-bones roast chicken is in its technique. To make it, thoroughly preheat a cast-iron skillet before sliding into it a seasoned bird, breast side up. In under an hour you\u2019ll get a stunner of a chicken, with moist, tender white meat, crisp, salty chicken skin, and juicy dark meat all done to a turn. If you don\u2019t already have a cast-iron skillet large enough to hold a whole chicken, this recipe is a good enough reason to invest in one.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/05/dining/mb-simplest-roast-chicken/mb-simplest-roast-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "cast iron, roast chicken, skillet, whole chicken, passover", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 7258}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 673, "unsaturatedFatContent": "34 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "51 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "50 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "949 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole chicken, 3 to 4 pounds, trimmed of excess fat", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a cast-iron skillet on a low rack in the oven and heat the oven to 500 degrees.
