{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chard and Sweet Corn Tacos", "description": "These sweet and spicy tacos can be filled with chard of any color, or other greens like beet greens or amaranth. I used Swiss chard for these tacos, but other greens like beet greens or amaranth will work. I don\u2019t recommend strong-tasting cruciferous greens like kale, though. You can use green chard, red chard or rainbow, and do include the stalks if they\u2019re nice and wide. Don\u2019t skimp on the garlic. As for the salsa, you can choose between fresh or cooked tomato salsa, or use a salsa verde made with tomatillos. They all work well. A quarter cup of filling is plenty for each taco.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/19/science/18recipehealthb/18recipehealthb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 tacos, serving 4", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, tacos", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegetarian, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 117}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 generous bunch Swiss chard (about 3/4 pound)", "Salt to taste", "1 medium white, red or yellow onion, sliced", "3 large garlic cloves, minced", "Kernels from 2 ears sweet corn", "Freshly ground pepper", "8 warm corn tortillas", "1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco or feta (but not too salty a feta)", "Salsa of your choice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil while you stem chard and wash leaves in 2 rinses of water.
