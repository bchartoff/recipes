Here, Moroccan seasonings mingle for a bright balance of flavors: sweetness comes from dates and onions, and heat and spice from ginger and cumin. This tagine is traditionally accompanied only by warm whole wheat pita or Arab flatbread. But, if you wish, serve with buttered couscous or even mashed potatoes. Roasted parsnips or wilted mustard greens would harmonize well, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/07/dining/07KITCH_SPAN/07KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "moroccan", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "lamb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 337}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 732, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "33 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "43 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "55 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "991 milligrams", "sugarContent": "23 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large lamb shanks, about 4 1/2 pounds\n", "Salt and pepper\n", "6 garlic cloves, minced\n", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger\n", "1 tablespoon paprika\n", "2 teaspoons ground cumin\n", "2 tablespoons butter\n", "1 large onion, sliced, about 2 cups\n", "Small pinch saffron\n", "1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper", "1 tablespoon tomato paste\n", "1 2-inch piece cinnamon stick\n", "2 teaspoons dried ginger \n", "1/2 cup chopped dates of any kind, plus 24 whole Medjool dates\n", "1/2 cup golden raisins, soaked in hot water to soften for 30 minutes and drained\n", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds\n", "Cilantro sprigs, for garnish\n"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim shanks of excess fat, then season generously with salt and pepper.
