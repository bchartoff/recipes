{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Butternut Squash With Lentils and Feta", "description": "The secret to making winter squash taste even better is to bump up its sweetness by roasting it, then pair it with sweet and sour ingredients, like this pomegranate molasses and honey dressing. Thinly slicing the squash speeds up roasting time, and, if you have access to precooked lentils, feel free to add them here. You can also substitute other soft, creamy cheeses for the feta, such as goat or sheep\u2019s milk cheeses. Olive oil can leave a bitter aftertaste in emulsions, so, if you prefer to avoid it, use a neutral oil like grapeseed. Serve as a fall side, or alongside warm slices of generously buttered sourdough toast as a light meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nik Sharma"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/dining/ns-butternut-squash-salad/merlin_175270455_ed02bf8d-d53d-49e1-a2a6-f0f3211b0ac7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "butternut squash, feta, lentils, pomegranate molasses, fall, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2275}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup black or green lentils", "1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "Kosher salt", "1 (1-pound) butternut squash", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "1/4 cup crumbled feta", "4 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons roasted, salted pumpkin seeds", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil or grapeseed oil", "2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses", "1 tablespoon honey", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, toasted", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
