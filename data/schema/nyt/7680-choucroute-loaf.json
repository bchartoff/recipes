Paired with sauerkraut, the dish winks at real choucroute and in some ways is even more delicious. For finicky kids, provide a side dish of mashed potatoes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/09/dining/recipes-choucrouteloaf/recipes-choucrouteloaf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner, times classics", "keywords": "apple, beef, pork, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 238}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 391, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "506 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "1 onion, chopped", "1 tart apple, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "1/4 pound smoked ham, minced", "1 1/4 pound mixture of ground chuck, pork and veal", "1 cup rye bread crumbs", "4 tablespoons prepared horseradish", "1 tablespoon grainy Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves", "1 teaspoon caraway seeds", "1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper", "2 eggs, lightly beaten", "1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
