{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Sweet Potatoes", "description": "For consistently soft and sweet roasted sweet potatoes, start with small or medium sweet potatoes because they tend to be less starchy. Halve them lengthwise, season and oil generously, then arrange cut-sides down. Their skins shield the flesh from drying out, while the cut sides caramelize from contact with the hot pan. Most importantly, put the sweet potatoes into the oven before heating it; according to Harold McGee, the author of \u201cOn Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen\u201d (Scribner, 2004), the more time the potatoes spend between 135 and 170 degrees, the more starch molecules convert to sugar, which means sweeter sweet potatoes. Eat any way you like: slathered with butter or other toppings, on its own alongside meats or tofu, or sliced for green or grain salads.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/09/multimedia/as-roasted-sweet-potatoes-1-0703/as-roasted-sweet-potatoes-1-0703-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "fall, winter, sweet potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 296}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 small or medium sweet potatoes (8 to 10 ounces each), scrubbed then halved lengthwise", "2 tablespoons neutral oil (such as canola or grapeseed), plus more as needed", "Salt\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a sheet pan with parchment or foil.
