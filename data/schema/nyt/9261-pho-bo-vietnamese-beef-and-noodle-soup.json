They sometimes form the bulk of salads and soups and are often used as wrappers, seasonings and condiments. Here, a pile of fresh herbs are served alongside this classic Vietnamese beef soup, so diners can add to taste. Basil, cilantro and mint are critical, but chervil, lovage, parsley, shiso, dill, marjoram and other tender herbs work, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/12/dining/12COOKING-PHOBO1/12COOKING-PHOBO1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "pastas, soups and stews", "keywords": "beef stock, sirloin, vermicelli, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 271}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 698, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "1905 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound thin rice noodles (labeled \"vermicelli\" or \"rice sticks\")", "8 cups rich beef or chicken stock", "4 star anise", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 1-inch chunk peeled fresh ginger", "1 onion, quartered (don't bother to peel)", "4 cloves", "1 pound boneless sirloin, tenderloin or round (chicken may be substituted), cut into 16 thin slices", "2 tablespoons fish sauce (nam pla or nuoc mam, available at Asian markets) or soy sauce", "Freshly ground black pepper to taste", "Salt to taste", "2 limes, cut into wedges", "8 scallions, minced", "Several Thai or other chilies, stemmed, seeded and minced", "A heaping plate of mixed herbs, washed and dried: basil, cilantro and mint are most important, but chervil, lovage, parsley, shiso, dill, marjoram and other tender herbs are all appropriate."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak rice noodles in hot water to cover."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, combine stock, star anise, cinnamon, ginger, onion and cloves in saucepan; turn heat to high.
