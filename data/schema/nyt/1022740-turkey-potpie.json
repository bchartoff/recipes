{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Potpie", "description": "No one knows when people started making pies, but they were common in medieval Middle Eastern and European cooking. \u201cThe Oxford Companion to Food\u201d speculates that the English word may come from the word \u201cmagpie,\u201d because magpies collect random items in the way a pie often houses varied ingredients. It\u2019s appropriate, then, that this pie is here to accommodate your Thanksgiving leftovers: turkey, of course, but also leftover roasted squash or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms in place of peas, chop up half a rutabaga instead of carrot and celery, or a stray leek or shallot instead of onion. Any fresh soft herbs can go in the biscuit topping. For an even simpler version, use canned biscuits arranged on top of the filling as the crust, or defrosted puff pastry with a vent cut in the middle. For a more assertive flavor, use the larger amount of mustard.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/15/dining/sd-turkey-pot-pie/merlin_196956828_3c1aa39f-6e00-4830-a8a5-8c66c238891c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course", "keywords": "celery, peas, potpie, thanksgiving leftover, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 608}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small chunks", "1/4 cup thinly sliced chives", "1/4 cup chopped, lightly packed fresh soft herbs, such as parsley, dill or tarragon", "3/4 cup buttermilk", "5 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 small red or yellow onion, chopped", "Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "6 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 small or medium carrot, peeled and chopped", "2 celery ribs, including leaves, chopped", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "2 cups chicken or turkey broth or stock", "2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce", "Juice of \u00bd lemon (about 1 generous tablespoon)", "1 1/2 cups chopped or shredded cooked turkey or chicken", "3/4 cup frozen peas", "Black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the biscuit dough: In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.
