{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Prepared Horseradish", "description": "Homemade prepared horseradish tastes fresher than store-bought varieties and is a surprisingly versatile condiment that will keep, refrigerated, for about three months. Start with fresh horseradish, which should be chilled to preserve its punch, and a box grater, a hand grinder or a food processor. Horseradish is potent, so make sure to keep the windows open or wear glasses to protect yourself from the fumes when handling the raw ingredient. Whisked into vinaigrettes, drizzled over poached fish or stirred into mayonnaise for a brighter egg salad sandwich, a spoonful of prepared horseradish wakes up whatever you're cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/dining/08horseradishrex1/08horseradishrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american, jewish", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, condiments", "keywords": "horseradish, vinegar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 37}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 120, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "2 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "958 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh horseradish root", "1/2 cup white vinegar", "1 cup cold water, plus more as needed", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel the horseradish and cut out any dark veins.
