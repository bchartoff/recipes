{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Paul Carmichael\u2019s Curried Rice", "description": "I ate a version of this rice as an accompaniment to a few deep-fried paddles of Australian crab, sitting at the kitchen counter of Paul Carmichael\u2019s excellent Momofuku Seiobo in Sydney. It tasted of a world far away, of Mr. Carmichael\u2019s childhood in Barbados, in the Lesser Antilles, where influences of Africa, India, China and Britain combine in the food: the grains fried in butter scented with murky yellow curry powder, warm and fragrant, and flavored with fiery minced habanero and a salty punch of soy and oyster sauces. I sighed when I finished and asked for a recipe. I\u2019ve been messing with it ever since. Please note: You\u2019ll end up with more curry paste than you\u2019ll need to season the rice, even if you season aggressively. Refrigerate the extra to make the dish a second time (it keeps well), or to enliven ground meat for a Caribbean-ish version of sloppy joes, even just to improve a bowl of instant ramen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/magazine/19mag-eat-slide-IH4N/19mag-eat-slide-IH4N-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings, plus additional curry paste", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice", "keywords": "butter, curry leaves, curry powder, habanero, oyster sauce, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 258}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper", "3 tablespoons curry powder", "2 teaspoons canola or other neutral oil", "5 fresh curry leaves", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 shallots, peeled and diced", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus additional as needed", "1 1/2 tablespoons oyster sauce, plus additional as needed", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1 to 2 habanero chiles, seeded and minced", "3 cups cooked white rice, cooled", "2 limes, 1 juiced and 1 quartered"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a large skillet over medium heat, and add to it the black pepper and white pepper.
