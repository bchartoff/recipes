{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cold Candied Oranges", "description": "Slowly poaching fresh, firm seedless oranges in a light sugar syrup is a simple yet magical kind of alchemy. You still end up with oranges, yes, but now they are glistening jewels \u2014 cooked but juicy, candied but fresh, bitter but sweet \u2014 that make an uncommonly elegant and refreshing dessert after a heavy winter meal. These cold candied oranges keep up to a month in the refrigerator, and any that are left over can be delicious with thick yogurt in the morning, or beside a cup of mint tea in the afternoon. But in every case, they are most bracing and most delicious when super cold.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/26/magazine/26mag-eat-02/26mag-eat-02-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 candied oranges", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, vegan, dessert, orange, sugar, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 856}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 firm, juicy, seedless oranges with thin skins (recently I\u2019ve been using Cara Cara oranges), no bigger than a baseball", "6 cups granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a stainless-steel pot of water to a boil.
