{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Master Recipe for Biscuits and Scones", "description": "Southern biscuits and British scones can seem intimidating: both have the kind of mystique that can discourage home bakers.  But the point of them is to be truly quick and easy \u2014 unlike yeast-raised bread and rolls, they are thrown together just before a meal and served hot, crisp on the outside and soft in the center. And what's more, they are essentially the same recipe: all that separates them is a bit of sugar and an egg.\n\nThe genius of this particular recipe is not in the ingredients, but in the geometry. Slicing a rolled-out slab of dough into squares or rectangles is infinitely simpler than cutting out rounds \u2014 and there's less chance of toughening the dough by re-rolling it and adding more flour. The recipe immediately below makes biscuits, and the notes at the bottom of the recipe have instructions for altering the dough to make scones.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/26/dining/26biscuit/26biscuit-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 biscuits or scones", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, quick", "keywords": "biscuits, scones, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 365}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 331, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "182 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "1/4 pound (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cubed", "1 cup heavy cream", "3 tablespoons melted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
