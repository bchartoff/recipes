{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Gnocchi With Tomato and Red Onion", "description": "Inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016452-italian-bread-salad-panzanella\">panzanella</a>, the beloved Tuscan bread salad, this dish swaps out stale bread for pan-fried gnocchi. The plump, crusty dumplings do a surprisingly good job at soaking up the summery combination of tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and olive oil, while still maintaining their crisp edge. Shelf-stable gnocchi work best, as they are sturdier and crisp up well, but you could use frozen gnocchi, taking extra care not to move them around too much in the pan so they don\u2019t break apart. Top with a sharp cheese such as Parmesan, pecorino or ricotta salata, for a hit of saltiness, if you like. This meal is best eaten immediately while the gnocchi remains crispy, but it can sit for up to 30 minutes, giving the flavors time to mingle. (However, don\u2019t let it sit too long, as the gnocchi will turn mushy.)\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/07/dining/hm-tomato-gnocchi/merlin_204847857_105fb099-f53c-4988-a9c3-352df2bf7415-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, main course", "keywords": "gnocchi, red onion, tomato, healthy, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1640}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 to 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 (17-ounce) package shelf-stable (or frozen) potato gnocchi", "1 1/2 pounds tomatoes (any variety)", "1/2 red onion, thinly sliced", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "Handful of chopped parsley, plus more for serving", "Handful of torn basil, plus more for serving\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large (about 12-inch), well-seasoned cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high;\u00a0add 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
