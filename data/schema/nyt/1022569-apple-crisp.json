Choose a variety of apples, then adjust the amounts of sugar and lemon juice to strike the right tangy balance for the filling. Or customize your crisp by using your favorite spices and nuts. The dessert tastes particularly comforting hot out of the oven, with the caramelized apple juices bubbling around the nutty cookie-like clusters, but it\u2019s just as good cold for breakfast the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/22/dining/21Korex1-crisp/21Korex1-crisp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dessert", "keywords": "apple, cobbler, crumble, and crisp, pecans, rolled oats, walnut, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1881}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/71 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons packed brown sugar", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, cardamom or nutmeg, or a combination", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "6 tablespoons/84 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 cup/116 grams chopped pecans or walnuts, or a combination", "1/4 cup/28 grams old-fashioned rolled oats", "1 to 4 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, cardamom or nutmeg, or a combination", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 pounds apples, preferably firm, with a mix of tart and sweet-tart (8 to 10 apples)", "1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the topping: Rub together the flour, both sugars, the spice and salt in a medium bowl.
