{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Chicken Thighs With Lemon, Thyme and Rosemary", "description": "The ease and deliciousness of this recipe, from the chef Nancy Silverton's cookbook \"Mozza at Home,\" deserves to be emphasized. Though you need several hours of refrigeration to allow the chicken skin to dry out, which makes it crisp, you can be flexible about it; do what\u2019s convenient. No matter what, just be sure to pat the skin dry with paper towels. You may also find the final run under the broiler unnecessary. Use your judgment. And also consider swirling in a good splash of white wine or chicken stock to the juices in the baking dish before spooning them on the chicken.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/dining/28ENTERTAIN3/28ENTERTAIN3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken thighs, garlic, lemon, rosemary, gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1486}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 537, "unsaturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "628 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 chicken thighs, bone in and skin on", "1 medium onion, peeled, quartered vertically and sliced 1/4-inch thick vertically", "1 cup peeled garlic cloves (about 40)", "1 lemon cut in 1/4-inch-thick slices, seeded", "15 fresh thyme sprigs", "4 (3-inch) rosemary sprigs", "2 tablespoons kosher salt, or to taste", "2 teaspoons ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken thighs dry and place, skin side up, in a single layer on a baking sheet.
