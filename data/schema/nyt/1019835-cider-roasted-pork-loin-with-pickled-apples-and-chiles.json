{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cider-Roasted Pork Loin With Pickled Apples and Chiles", "description": "Roasting a pork loin on a bed of apples, onions and cinnamon moistened with cider gives the meat a caramelized sweetness and spicy perfume. The roast browns on top while the apples and onions collapse into a meltingly tender, golden heap beneath it. Then, to offset all the soft richness, bright and tangy pickled apples and chiles are served alongside. It\u2019s a dish that\u2019s both company worthy and cozy, as perfect for a Sunday supper, spooned over mashed potatoes or polenta, as it is served to guests alongside an elegant gratin. Keep some extra apple cider on hand to add to the pan if it dries out and starts to burn. Just a splash or two should do it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/19/dining/19apperex1/19apperex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "boneless pork loin, fennel seeds, hard cider, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 337}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 397, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "762 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup cider vinegar", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1/4 teaspoon allspice berries", "1/4 teaspoon coriander seeds", "Pinch kosher salt", "1 large tart apple, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "2 small jalape\u00f1os, seeded and thinly sliced", "1 (2 1/2 to 3-pound) boneless pork loin (not tenderloin)", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary, plus more rosemary sprigs for garnish", "2 teaspoons fennel seeds, coarsely crushed", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 large, tart apple, halved, cored, and sliced into 1/4-inch slices", "1 onion, halved and cut into 1/4-inch slices", "3 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "1 cinnamon stick, broken in half", "1/2 cup chicken stock, more as needed", "About 1 cup (8 fluid ounces) hard apple cider or chicken stock, more as needed", "1 tablespoon butter, cubed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the pickled apples, in a small pot, combine 1/4 cup water with vinegar, sugar, allspice, coriander and salt.
