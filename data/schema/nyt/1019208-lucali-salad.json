{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lucali Salad", "description": "Mark Iacono sometimes serves a version of this salad at Lucali, his candlelit church of pizza in Brooklyn. It\u2019s what he calls a \u201cbottom of the bowl\u201d salad, reminiscent of what\u2019s left after a long\u00a0Sunday\u00a0dinner with family, with tomatoes, black olives and red onion deeply marinated in a vinegar-heavy dressing. He layers these above and below cold, crisp lettuce, adds a final drizzle of dressing and serves the salad with a meatball on top of it. But it goes as well plain alongside a pizza or under a sausage that\u2019s been simmered in sauce, with stuffed shells or lasagna or eggplant Parm. You don\u2019t need fancy tomatoes or lettuce with bona fides, just strong vinaigrette and enough time to allow the tomatoes to bleed out in it before you assemble the salad and serve.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/04/magazine/04mag-eat1/04mag-eat1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "black olives, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 615}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 521, "unsaturatedFatContent": "45 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "54 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "684 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 smallish tomatoes, halved and cut into fifths", "1/2 smallish red onion, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 rib celery with leaves, ideally from the heart, chopped", "18 canned, pitted black olives, plus 2 tablespoons olive brine", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon lemon pepper", "1/3 cup olive oil", "1 teaspoon red-wine vinegar", "1 head iceberg lettuce, outer leaves and brown bits removed, roughly torn", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 cup red-wine vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the tomatoes, red onion and celery in a large bowl.
