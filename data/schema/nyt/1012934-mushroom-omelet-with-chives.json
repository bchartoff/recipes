{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom Omelet With Chives", "description": "Mushrooms are the most versatile of ingredients, with a meaty texture and a rich, deep flavor ideal for vegetarian dishes. When raw, they\u2019re elegant and delicious; when cooked, they become substantial. They are as welcome in a classic French omelet as they are in an Asian stir-fry. Mushrooms also are a nutritional bargain. Two ounces of sliced white mushrooms \u2014 about a cup \u2014 contain only 15 calories, and they are among the best dietary sources of B vitamins. Best of all, there are just so many mushroom dishes to try. This savory omelet is great for dinner or for brunch. If I\u2019m making it for two, I make one large omelet in a 10-inch pan. It\u2019s just as easy as making two individual omelets, and both servings are ready at the same time.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/12/14/health/14recipehealth_600/14recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, quick", "keywords": "eggs, mushroom, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 161}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 388, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "509 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 shallot, minced", "1/4 pound white or cremini mushrooms, rinsed briefly and wiped dry", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 to 2 garlic cloves (to taste), minced", "2 teaspoons minced flat-leaf parsley", "4 eggs", "1 tablespoon minced chives", "2 teaspoons low-fat milk", "3 tablespoons grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim off the ends of the mushrooms, and cut into thick slices.
