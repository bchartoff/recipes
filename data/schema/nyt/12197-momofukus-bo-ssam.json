{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Momofuku's Bo Ssam", "description": "This is a recipe to win the dinner party sweepstakes, and at very low stakes: slow-roasted pork shoulder served with lettuce, rice and a raft of condiments. The chef David Chang serves the dish, known by its Korean name, bo ssam, at his Momofuku restaurant in the East Village and elsewhere. He shared the recipe with The Times in 2012. Mr. Chang is known as a kitchen innovator, but his bo ssam is a remarkably straightforward way to achieve high-level excellence with little more than ingredients and time. Simply cure the pork overnight beneath a shower of salt and some sugar, then roast it in a low oven until it collapses. Apply some brown sugar and a little more salt, then roast the skin a while longer until it takes on the quality of glistening bark. Meanwhile, make condiments \u2013 hot sauces and kimchi, rice, some oysters if you wish. Then tear meat off the bone and wrap it in lettuce, and keep at that until everything\u2019s gone.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/15/magazine/15eat1_span/15eat1_span-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "totalTime": "PT13H", "recipeYield": "6 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "main course, pork", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2763}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1115, "unsaturatedFatContent": "45 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "69 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "71 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "1684 milligrams", "sugarContent": "34 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 whole bone-in pork butt or picnic ham (8 to 10 pounds)", "1 cup white sugar", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon kosher salt", "7 tablespoons brown sugar", "2 1/2 cups thinly sliced scallions, both green and white parts", "1/2 cup peeled, minced fresh ginger", "1/4 cup neutral oil (like grapeseed)", "1 1/2 teaspoons light soy sauce", "1 scant teaspoon sherry vinegar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste", "2 tablespoons fermented bean-and-chili paste (ssamjang, available in many Asian markets, and online)", "1 tablespoon chili paste (kochujang, available in many Asian markets, and online)", "1/2 cup sherry vinegar", "1/2 cup neutral oil (like grapeseed)", "2 cups plain white rice, cooked", "3 heads bibb lettuce, leaves separated, washed and dried", "1 dozen or more fresh oysters (optional)", "Kimchi (available in many Asian markets, and online)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the pork in a large, shallow bowl.
