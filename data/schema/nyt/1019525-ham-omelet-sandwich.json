A thin, flat omelet layered with even thinner slices of ham is stacked between slices of buttered soft white bread, then cut into triangles. You can, of course, add cheese, but its beauty is in its simplicity. And, besides, going without cheese makes the sandwich as tasty at room temperature as it is when warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/dining/ko-ham-omelet-horizontal/ko-ham-omelet-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 sandwich", "recipeCuisine": "chinese, japanese", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, sandwiches", "keywords": "egg, pain de mie, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 42}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 112, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "8 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "190 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large eggs", "1/4 teaspoon sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened\u00a0", "2 slices Asian milk bread, pain de mie or other soft white bread", "1 ounce deli-thin sliced ham (1 slice)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, beat eggs, sugar and salt with a fork until blended but not frothy."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Divide the butter in half and spread on each slice\u00a0(1/2 tablespoon each).\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the remaining teaspoon butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat.
