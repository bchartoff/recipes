{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-fried Rice With Amaranth or Red Chard and Thai Basil", "description": "This is another Thai-influenced dish, spiced with sriracha and featuring the beautiful green vegetable amaranth. Amaranth is a beautiful green with small red and green leaves that grow, bush-like, off medium-thick stems. I get it from Asian vendors at the farmers\u2019 market, where I can also find Thai basil. I cut away the very tough ends but use the more tender parts of the stalks. A good substitute here would be red chard, whose stems can be diced and included in the stir-fry. You could also use beet greens, but I\u2019d omit the stringy stems. I spiced this Thai-influenced stir-fry with sriracha, but that spicy chili sauce is optional.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/17/science/17recipehealth/17recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, kosher, vegetarian, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 351, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "626 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 to 5 cups cooked rice (white or brown, medium-grain preferred), either chilled or at room temperature", "3 eggs", "2 teaspoons plus 2 tablespoons peanut, canola, rice bran or grape seed oil", "2 to 3 teaspoons minced garlic (to taste)", "2 to 3 teaspoons minced fresh ginger (to taste)", "1 bunch amaranth, thick stem ends cut away, the rest coarsely chopped (about 4 cups), or red chard, leaves torn from stalks, stalks diced", "2/3 cup chopped Thai basil", "1 bunch scallions, sliced, white and dark green parts separated", "1 to 2 tablespoons soy sauce, to taste", "1 tablespoon sriracha sauce (optional)", "1/4 teaspoon ground pepper", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Beat one of the eggs in a bowl and season with a pinch of salt.
