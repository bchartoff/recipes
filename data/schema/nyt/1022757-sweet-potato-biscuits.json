{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potato Biscuits", "description": "Chunks of baked sweet potato enhance warm, tender and flaky biscuits, which also get a savory lift from sliced scallions. To achieve distinct biscuit layers, an integral characteristic of this quick bread, keep your butter cold and work quickly when folding. You can chill the dough in between steps if needed to keep the butter solid, because cold, hard butter will help the dough maintain its layered structure in the oven. Serve the biscuits piping hot right out the oven, broken open and slathered with a generous smear of the spiced honey butter. The sweet potato can be baked in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The spiced honey butter can be prepared up to a week in advance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/16/dining/YK-sweet-potato-biscuits/merlin_197626104_28fa2dc7-74a2-4b77-a7c7-0a3030d27308-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H10M", "recipeYield": "12 biscuits", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "side dish", "keywords": "biscuit, buttermilk, honey, scallion, sweet potato, fall, kwanzaa, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 458}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium sweet potato (11 to 14 ounces), scrubbed", "4 cups/526 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 cup/170 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes", "2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced (1/3 cup)", "1 1/4 cups buttermilk", "1/2 cup/114 grams unsalted butter, room temperature", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "2 tablespoons honey"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the biscuits: Heat oven to 375 degrees.
