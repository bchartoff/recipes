{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry and Ice Cream Sandwiches", "description": "This summertime snack is a spin on the Italian treat, brioche con gelato, which is typically served in hotter months for breakfast. This ice cream sandwich is made with actual bread \u2014 rather than cookies \u2014 landing this dessert in the not-too-sweet category. Griddling or grilling the buns with a butter-sugar finish adds a bit of caramelized sweetness. These are best eaten immediately, so have guests at the ready for assembling. The combination of still-warm bread, melting ice cream and strawberries is bliss.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Laurie Ellen Pellicano"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/21/dining/lep-strawberry-ice-cream-sandwiches/merlin_188069937_308af533-e491-4515-a7eb-7a9ea116a031-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, snack, finger foods, ice creams and sorbets, dessert", "keywords": "brioche, ice cream, strawberries, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 223}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pint/12 ounces strawberries, washed, hulled and roughly chopped", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling", "4 to 6 slider buns or dinner rolls, preferably brioche (see Tip)", "1/4 cup salted butter, melted", "Amaro Montenegro, for drizzling (optional)", "1 pint vanilla or strawberry ice cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If grilling, heat the grill.
