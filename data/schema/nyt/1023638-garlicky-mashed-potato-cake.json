{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlicky Mashed Potato Cake", "description": "If you like the creaminess of mashed potatoes but not the uniform texture, try this potato cake, which is like a cross between hash browns and a classic mash. Made with fluffy baked russet potatoes and flavored with garlic, browned butter and tangy sour cream, the cake is cooked on the stovetop, then transferred to the oven, where it takes on a crispy, golden brown crust. Make sure your nonstick skillet is oven-safe, or use a very well-seasoned cast-iron skillet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Claire Saffitz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/10potatoesrex3-cake/merlin_214833936_4fc3699a-c308-49a3-ba03-fe9f63b120ed-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "brown butter, garlic, russet potatoes, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 971}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 pounds russet potatoes (about 6 medium-large), scrubbed", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Pinch of ground nutmeg", "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon finely chopped chives"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 425 degrees.
