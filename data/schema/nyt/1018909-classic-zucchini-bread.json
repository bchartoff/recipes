{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Classic Zucchini Bread", "description": "A quintessential quick bread, zucchini bread blurs the line between breakfast and cake, making it acceptable for both. This version is on the sweeter side, the vegetal flavors mellowed by brown sugar, cinnamon and a bit of browned butter. While not always necessary, squeezing excess water from the zucchini will prevent the batter from being too wet while keeping the end result moist. Since this recipe makes two loaves (if you\u2019re going to grate all that zucchini, might as well make it count), know that one will freeze excellently for at least a month. The recipe can also be halved with great success.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/25/dining/25COOKING-ZUCCHINIBREAD1/25COOKING-ZUCCHINIBREAD1-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "2 loaves", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick breads", "keywords": "nutmeg, zucchini", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 325}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 308, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "38 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "251 milligrams", "sugarContent": "18 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["\u00bd cup/113 grams unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan", "3 \u00bd cups/447 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons cinnamon", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 \u00bc teaspoons baking powder", "1 \u00bc teaspoons baking soda", "\u00bd teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (or \u00bc teaspoon ground nutmeg)", "4 large eggs", "\u00be cup/165 grams light brown sugar", "\u00be cup/151 grams sugar", "\u00be cup/180 milliliters canola oil", "1 \u00bd pounds zucchini, unpeeled and grated on a box grater (about 3 medium zucchini)", "4 tablespoons demerara or turbinado sugar (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
