{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peaches and Cream Pie", "description": "This recipe is inspired by the fruit and cream pies at <a href=\"https://www.briermerefarms.com/\">Briermere Farms</a>, in Riverhead, N.Y., a <span>fruit farm and bakery on the North Fork of Long Island</span>. Here, a press-in graham cracker crust is swapped in for the traditional pastry crust, but otherwise the recipe stays true to the signature pie, with a giant mound of fresh sliced peaches concealing a lightly sweetened whipped cream filling beneath. Cream cheese acts as a stabilizer in the whipped cream, allowing you to assemble the crust and filling in advance \u2014 but once you add the peaches, the pie is best served within the hour. Perfectionists take note: This pie is a little messy, but that\u2019s part of its charm. If you can\u2019t find ripe, juicy peaches, this recipe is equally delicious made with fresh strawberries or blueberries. The quality and ripeness of the fruit is more important than the variety.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/28/dining/lh-peaches-and-cream-pie/merlin_174838560_2a08f587-d2fe-46f6-837f-219b54e0da19-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H40M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "butter, cinnamon, confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, peach, peach pie, sugar, vanilla, whipping cream, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1412}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/3 cups/160 grams graham cracker crumbs (from about 10 or 11 graham cracker sheets)", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted", "2 ounces/60 grams cream cheese, at room temperature", "1/2 cup/60 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted", "1 cup/240 milliliters cold heavy whipping cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 pounds/900 grams ripe yellow peaches (5 to 7 peaches)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
