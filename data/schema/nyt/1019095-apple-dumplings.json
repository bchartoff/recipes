All-butter pastry, rolled out and wrapped casually around a brown sugar and currant-stuffed apple, looks rustic and adorable and tastes even better. No pie plates, double crusts, or fancy crimping to worry about. And, they are already portioned perfectly. Serve them warm with scoops of vanilla ice cream or swirls of cr\u00e8me fraiche.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/12/dining/12COOKING-APPLEDUMPLINGS/12COOKING-APPLEDUMPLINGS-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastries, pies and tarts", "keywords": "dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 82}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 634, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "71 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "38 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "23 grams", "sodiumContent": "494 milligrams", "sugarContent": "32 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 cup/227 grams (2 sticks) cold, unsalted butter, cut into pieces", "6 to 8 tablespoons ice water\u00a0", "1 large egg, lightly beaten", "Turbinado sugar, for sprinkling", "1/3 cup/73 grams light or dark brown sugar", "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "6 small baking apples (like McIntosh, about 5\u00bd ounces each), peeled", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus more for greasing the baking dish", "1/4 cup/35 grams currants or raisins (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, pulse a few times to combine the flour, sugar, and salt.
