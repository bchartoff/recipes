Carefully add boiling water to come almost all the way up the sides of the cups. Bake until the centers of the puddings reach 190 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 55 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes. Run a thin flexible knife along the upper inside edge of each pudding to loosen it. Hold a small plate firmly over a custard cup, invert the cup and plate, then remove the cup. Repeat with the remaining cups. Serve warm, paired with something slightly acidic, like apple slices in simple syrup with lemon juice."}]}
