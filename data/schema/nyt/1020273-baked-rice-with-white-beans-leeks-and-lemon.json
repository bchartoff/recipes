{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Rice With White Beans, Leeks and Lemon", "description": "Baking is a fail-safe, hands-off method for making perfect rice every time. Add roasted leeks, lemon peel, almonds and white beans, and it becomes a company-worthy vegetarian dinner inspired by prasorizo, the classic Greek rice-and-leek dish. Finished with Parmesan and fresh herbs, it's an excellent one-pan meal, but it would also be great served alongside grilled fish, shrimp or chicken. If you like, you can make it even more filling by adding other vegetables like tomatoes, zucchini or broccoli florets with the leeks and almonds, or stir in spinach, arugula or sliced snap peas after it comes out of the oven in Step 4. Omit the Parmesan and it\u2019s vegan, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/05/dining/as-baked-rice-with-leeks/merlin_155855103_a95d2583-334e-4700-81b6-98e27d3ceeb4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "greek", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, casseroles, grains and rice", "keywords": "almond, basmati rice, leek, parmesan, white beans, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 725}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 leeks (about 2 pounds), trimmed, white and pale green parts sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1 lemon", "1/4 cup raw almonds", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 cups uncooked basmati rice", "1 (15-ounce) can white beans (such as cannellini or great Northern), rinsed", "2 1/2 cups boiling water", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving", "1/4 cup thinly sliced or chopped basil, chives, mint or fennel fronds, plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
