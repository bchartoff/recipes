Good scallops need little more than a squeeze of lime, but sliced chile pepper and a handful of cilantro bring brightness to this easy summer dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/09/dining/Ceviche-Style-Scallops/Ceviche-Style-Scallops-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 serving", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, cilantro, red onion, scallops, serrano chili, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 37}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large scallops", "Thinly sliced red onion", "Thinly sliced fresh Serrano or Thai chiles", "Salt and pepper", "Fresh lime juice", "Cilantro leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Slice the scallops into thin rounds and arrange them in an even layer on a plate.
