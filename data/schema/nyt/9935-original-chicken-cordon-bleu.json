It's also far easier to make than you may think. A chicken breast is pounded thin (we've been known to cheat by using pretrimmed cutlets), then wrapped around a slice of smoked ham and a bit of Swiss cheese, and secured with toothpicks. The roulade is coated in egg and bread crumbs, then pan-fried until golden brown, and a simple white wine cream sauce finishes it off.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Molly O'Neill"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/01/dining/01COOKING-CHICKEN-CORDON-BLEU1/01CHICKEN-CORDON-BLEU1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken breast, ham, Swiss cheese, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 261}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 537, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "52 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "801 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large boneless and skinless chicken breast halves (about 1 1/2 pounds)", "4 thin slices smoked ham", "2 ounces Swiss cheese, cut into 4 equal \"fingers\"", "1/4 cup flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon pepper", "1 large egg, beaten", "3/4 cup fresh bread crumbs", "1/4 cup unsalted butter", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons chicken stock", "3/4 cup white wine, heavy cream or additional chicken stock"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Lay the chicken breasts between pieces of wax paper and use a mallet to pound them to 1/4 inch to 1/8 inch thick.
