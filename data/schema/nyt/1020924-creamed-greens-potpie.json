{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamed Greens Potpie", "description": "This one-skillet, vegetarian pot pie trades the traditional chicken filling for creamy, garlicky greens. Hearty greens turn silky in a mixture of heavy cream, garlic, shallot, thyme and Parmesan under a lid of flaky puff pastry. Using store-bought puff pastry in place of homemade pie crust ensures a perfect result every time. It also steers pot pie into the weeknight-possible category. Greens and heavy cream require a good amount of salt to taste like their best selves, so taste and season well when the recipe says to do so.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/as-creamed-greens-pot-pie/merlin_170015901_6cad5bff-d28e-46ba-88d5-d5d11fdc2f05-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pies and tarts, vegetables", "keywords": "fall, spring, winter, greens, heavy cream, kale, parmesan, puff pastry, spinach, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 284}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "10 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)", "2 1/2 pounds mixed hearty greens (like kale, spinach, mustard greens or collard greens), stems removed and leaves torn into large pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "2 cups heavy cream", "1 teaspoon hot sauce", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan", "1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed", "1 egg, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment or foil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium (10-inch) oven-proof skillet over medium heat, melt the butter.
