{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Asado Negro", "description": "Here, we have a raggedy number out of Venezuela called asado negro. It requires a fat roast of beef that is simmered for a long time in dark caramel, its sweetness tempered by vinegar. The result is sticky and unctuous beneath a cloak of peppers, onions and leeks. It looks mysterious and bold on the plate and at the start of a New York winter can conjure some degree of Latin American humidity and joy.\n\nAsado negro has its primary home in Caracas, where it is often served during the holidays, alongside fried sweet plantains and white rice, with perhaps a tart green salad for contrast. The meat is napped in blackness that comes not from fire or smoke but from the absorption of all colors into one, a color as deep as space itself.\n\nIt is beef the color of a velvet dinner jacket seen across a dark lawn at midnight. It makes mockery of pot roast. And, as we shall see, it is exceedingly simple to make.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/12/05/magazine/05food-span/05food-span-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6 to 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "gluten-free, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 95}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 687, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1034 milligrams", "sugarContent": "30 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup white sugar", "2 teaspoons brown sugar", "2 cups white-wine vinegar", "1 cup dry red wine", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 pounds beef bottom-round roast", "5 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed", "1 large Spanish onion, peeled and thinly sliced", "2 stalks celery, chopped", "2 leeks, white and light-green parts only, washed well and thinly sliced", "2 bay leaves", "1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "Kosher salt", "freshly ground black pepper", "1 green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced", "1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons cilantro, well washed and roughly chopped, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
