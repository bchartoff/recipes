{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saffron Risotto With Spring Onion, Saffron and Green Garlic", "description": "This is inspired by \u2014 but much lighter than \u2014 risotto Milanese, the mother of all risottos. If you\u2019ve never made a risotto, start with this utterly simple classic. Green garlic resembles spring onions or leeks. The young bulbs have not yet set cloves. The flavor isn\u2019t at all sharp, but more like the flavor of leeks. Prepare as you would leeks.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/04/20/health/20recipehealth_600/20recipehealth_600-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "Serves four to six", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "arborio rice, chicken stock, saffron, healthy, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 37}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 403, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "57 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "906 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 7 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped spring onion or leek", "2/3 cup finely chopped green garlic (about 2 bulbs)", "Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste", "1 1/2 cups arborio or carnaroli rice", "Generous pinch of saffron threads", "1/2 cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc", "Freshly ground pepper", "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the stock or broth into a saucepan, and bring it to a simmer over low heat with a ladle nearby.

Cook, stirring often, until the stock is just about absorbed. Add another ladleful or two of the stock. Continue to cook in this fashion, adding more stock when the rice is almost dry and stirring. When the rice is just tender all the way through but still chewy, in 20 to 25 minutes, it is done.
