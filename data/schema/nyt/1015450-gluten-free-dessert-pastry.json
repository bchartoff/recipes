{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gluten-Free Dessert Pastry", "description": "I worked with many different combinations of flours before settling on this one. I love the flavor of the oat flour, but it is so fine that when I tried using all oat flour the pastry crumbled much too easily. So I combined it with corn flour, which is finely ground cornmeal; Bob\u2019s Red Mill produces the version I used. Millet flour will also work, but it has a chalkier flavor. The almond flour absorbs moisture and helps hold the dough together. The dough will crack if you roll it out cold, so I roll it between pieces of plastic before I chill it. Then I remove it from the refrigerator and let it soften just enough so that I can line the tart pans without it cracking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/11/health/11recipehealth/11recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "2 9-inch crusts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dessert, fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 91}, "recipeIngredient": ["160 grams (approximately 1 1/4 cups) corn flour or finely ground cornmeal\n", "150 grams (approximately 1 1/3 cups) oat flour (make sure it is from a gluten-free facility)\n", "168 grams (6 ounces) butter, preferably French style Plugr\u00e0", "4 grams (1/2 teaspoon) fine sea salt", "50 grams (approximately 1/4 rounded cup) sugar", "40 grams (approximately 1/3 rounded cup) almond flour", "9 grams (approximately 2 teaspoons) vanilla extract", "63 grams egg (approximately 1 extra large plus 2 teaspoons), beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sift together the corn flour and the oat flour.
