{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Dumplings With Chile Crisp", "description": "Great dumplings are as much about texture as taste, and these double the welcome contrast of tenderness and crunch. Simultaneously fried and steamed in a covered skillet, the wrappers develop crackling brown bases, while the tops become delicately chewy. Inside, the crunch of spicy chile crisp punctuates soft tofu and greens. Wringing water out of both fillings first allows them to soak in the soy sauce and chile crisp and ensures the filling doesn\u2019t end up watery or bland. Another benefit to this vegan filling is the ability to taste it raw and adjust the seasonings before wrapping.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/03/dining/01Dumplingrex3/merlin_182770566_40458909-be4a-4dd7-afe9-7eb27906aa0b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 35 dumplings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, dumplings, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "celeriac, firm tofu, lunar new year, soy sauce, spinach, tofu, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1014}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces firm tofu, cut into 1/4-inch slices", "6 ounces spinach, watercress or baby bok choy, finely chopped (3 cups)", "3 ounces garlic chives or scallions, thinly sliced (1 cup)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 celery stalks, finely chopped (1/2 cup)", "1 tablespoon soy sauce, plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon chile crisp, plus more for serving", "35 <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021845-homemade-dumpling-wrappers\">homemade dumpling wrappers</a> or store-bought round wrappers", "Grapeseed or other neutral oil, for frying", "Chinese black vinegar or rice vinegar and sesame oil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange the tofu slices in a single layer on a clean kitchen towel or between double layers of paper towels.

Choose your pan size accordingly: An 8-inch skillet will fit 8 to 10; a 10-inch will fit 14 to 16. When ready to cook, coat a well-seasoned cast-iron pan or nonstick skillet with a thin, even layer of oil. Arrange the dumplings in the pan, pleated side up, spacing 1/3 inch apart, and filling the pan.
