When eggs are firm but still partly liquid, drain the oyster mixture through a sieve placed over a bowl. Reserve the liquid and spread the oyster mixture over the eggs. Fold 1/2 of the egg mixture over the other to make a semicircular pie. Cook 1 1/2 minutes; lift up curved side with spatula and gently flip onto the other side. (The omelet doesn't need to leave the pan; just pivot on folded side.) Cook 1 1/2 minutes.
