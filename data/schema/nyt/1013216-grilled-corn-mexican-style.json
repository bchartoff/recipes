{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Corn, Mexican Style", "description": "Not only is this recipe very easy, it results in the kind of deep flavor associated with the crunchy street corn of Mexico. In many parts of Mexico, though, that crunchiness is highlighted with a creamy chile-lime sauce. This is more unusual than the tried, true and unbeatable butter-salt-and-pepper combination, and only slightly more complicated. Just mix together mayonnaise, freshly squeezed lime juice, chile powder, salt and pepper. It\u2019s pretty authentic, and a combination that brings out the grilled flavor, and balances the sweetness of fresh corn perfectly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/grilledcorn-still/grilledcorn-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "corn, mayonnaise, gluten-free, vegetarian, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 503}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 176, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "322 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ears of corn, husked", "2 tablespoons mayonnaise", "1 to 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice, or to taste", "1/4 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a grill, with heat medium-high and rack about 4 inches from the fire.
