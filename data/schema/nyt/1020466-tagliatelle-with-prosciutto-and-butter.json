Adapted from Evan Funke\u2019s pasta cookbook, \u201cAmerican Sfoglino,\u201d this dish comes together with just a few ingredients, but you\u2019ll need to work fast: Add the pasta, pasta water and cheese to the butter and prosciutto quickly, then stir vigorously while gently jostling the pan back and forth with the other hand. Serve immediately, as the pasta can lose its luster within minutes as it soaks up the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/16cookbooksrex1/16cookbooksrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, lunch, quick, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "main course, parmigiano-reggiano, prosciutto, tagliatelle", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 412}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 ounces prosciutto, torn into bite-size pieces", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3/4 pound <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020465-tagliatelle\">handmade fresh tagliatelle</a> or store-bought tagliatelle", "1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus additional for garnish if desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat until frothy and golden, about 1 minute.
