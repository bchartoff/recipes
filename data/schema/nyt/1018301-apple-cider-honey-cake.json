{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Cider Honey Cake", "description": "Alex Levin, the pastry chef of Osteria Morini in Washington, adapted this Rosh Hashana honey cake recipe from his grandmother, an accomplished baker, though he put his own touches on it. Mr. Levin took out the cloves, allspice and raisins, and added an apple cider compote to the batter, which moistens the cake and gives it a caramelized apple flavor that deepens the cake beyond honey and spice. With its combination of apples and honey, it's a lovely and symbolic finale for a New Year's celebration.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/21/dining/21ROSH1/21ROSH1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "apple, apple cider, honey, dessert, fall", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 531}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 371, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "402 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds/910 grams Granny Smith apples (about 5 or 6 apples), peeled, cored and cut into medium chunks", "3/4 cup/150 grams light brown sugar", "4 tablespoons/56 grams unsalted butter, or use 1/4 cup/60 milliliters grapeseed or other neutral oil", "1/2 to 1 1/2 cups/118 to 355 milliliters apple cider", "3/4 cup/170 grams melted unsalted butter or 3/4 cup/177 milliliters olive oil, more for the pan", "2 1/2 cups/310 grams all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda", "3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "3 large eggs", "3/4 cup/177 milliliters honey", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters whiskey", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for dusting"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the apple cider butter: Combine apples, light brown sugar and butter or oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a simmer.
