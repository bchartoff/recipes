Where it really sings, though, is as an accompaniment to samosas and chaats. Use Greek yogurt if you want a creamy chutney. Depending on preference, you can skip the raw garlic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zainab Shah"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/07/dining/02samosasrex3/merlin_185734728_a2fa1d7f-4fe6-455a-8859-d28de6f9db2f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "3/4 cup", "recipeCuisine": "indian, pakistani", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "chiles, cilantro, cumin, diwali, lemon, mint, yogurt, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 271}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup loosely packed cilantro with stems\u00a0", "2 cups loosely packed mint leaves", "2 teaspoons cumin seeds or 1 teaspoon cumin powder", "3 to 5 Thai green chiles, stemmed", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar\u00a0", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt\u00a0", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice", "1/4 cup Greek yogurt or water\u00a0", "2 garlic cloves (optional)\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and blend on high speed, scraping the bowl occasionally, until smooth and thick enough to hold at the lip of a spoon without any liquid running.
