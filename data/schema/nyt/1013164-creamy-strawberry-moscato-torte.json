{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Strawberry Moscato Torte", "description": "This dish is sort of a summery tiramis\u00f9. The creamy mascarpone and ladyfinger layers in tiramis\u00f9 are a natural with strawberries. But the espresso is too overbearing to match well with the sweet fruit. What to do? Swap out the liquid.  Moscato d\u2019Asti, a lightly sweet and fizzy wine, works here. Drizzle more of the wine on just before serving. It adds just the right brightness and verve.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/strawberry-moscato-torte/strawberry-moscato-torte-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "dessert, ladyfingers, mascarpone, strawberry, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 512}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 552, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "349 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 quarts strawberries", "1 tablespoon superfine or granulated sugar, more to taste", "1 bottle (750 milliliters) moscato wine, more for serving", "2 pounds mascarpone", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1/3 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar, more for sprinkling if desired", "2 plump, moist vanilla beans", "48 ladyfingers (2 packages)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Hull and slice 1 quart of strawberries.
