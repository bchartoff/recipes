{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Goose Barbacoa", "description": "The beefy nature of goose legs makes them a good choice for this rich, slightly spicy braise, but duck legs work fine, too. The timing here is very forgiving. This recipe cooks on a stovetop, but you could also braise the meat in a slow cooker or an oven set to about 325 degrees. The key is to simmer the legs until the meat pulls easily from the bone. The luscious secret comes at the end, when the warm meat is tossed in melted fat. The end result is highly adaptable: Wrap it in a warm tortilla, serve it alongside rice and beans with some good salsa, or spoon it atop a bed of sturdy greens and eat it as a salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/dining/06game-rex/merlin_149765619_3f553388-8ed5-4b96-82b7-d13c1118f111-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "broth, chipotles in adobo, duck, duck fat, goose, tortilla, fall, spring, summer, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 10}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1209, "unsaturatedFatContent": "60 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "93 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "72 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "1677 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large red onion, roughly chopped", "1/2 cup fresh lime juice (from about 4 limes)", "1/2 cup apple cider vinegar", "6 garlic cloves", "4 to 6 canned chipotle chiles in adobo or 3 tablespoons adobo sauce", "1 teaspoon ground chipotle or smoked paprika", "2 dried bay leaves", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground cloves", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil", "6 to 8 bone-in goose legs or 12 bone-in duck leg and thigh sections (about 5 pounds), skin removed", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 quart goose, beef or chicken stock", "1/4 cup goose fat, duck fat or lard, melted", "Tortillas, rice, beans, avocado, sour cream, salsa, lettuce, queso and tomatoes, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the onion, lime juice, vinegar, garlic, canned chipotle, ground chipotle, bay leaves, cumin, cloves and 1 tablespoon salt in a blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or stockpot over medium-high.
