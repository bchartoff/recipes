It works great on arugula, Romaine, kale or radicchio; steamed or roasted vegetables; hard-boiled eggs; and even grains. The recipe developer's mom has been feeding her this dressing since she could chew. Ali adds a bit more garlic and lemon than what you\u2019ll find here, so adjust it until it tastes good to you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/27/dining/as-lemon-caper/as-lemon-caper-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1/2 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, dips and spreads, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, capers, lemon juice, olive oil, parmesan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 299}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 771, "unsaturatedFatContent": "51 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "72 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "26 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "1033 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium garlic clove", "Black pepper (about 1/4 teaspoon)", "1 teaspoon capers (about 18)", "3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice", "5 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a cutting board, smash and coarsely mince the garlic.
