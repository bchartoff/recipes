{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roast Lamb", "description": "If you haven't cooked a whole leg of lamb before, here is the place to start. This is not a revolutionary recipe, but slathering on butter and (take our word for it) anchovies makes this version truly essential. It is excellent for the Easter feast \u2014 lamb has ancient associations with springtime, and it pairs well with sharp spring vegetables like asparagus, dandelion greens and artichokes. Lamb is also popular for Passover, but the leg is not considered kosher unless the sciatic nerve is removed. Some kosher butchers offer that, but we also give options for other cuts like shoulder and double loin. The butter can be replaced by duck or goose fat, or olive oil, but the gravy (made from pan drippings) will need to be adjusted. For roasting, meaty American lamb is preferable to cuts from Australia and New Zealand. Most American lambs are fed both grass and grain, yielding meat that is fine-grained, earthy and mild.\n\n<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692/939264-easter-lamb\">More Easter lamb recipes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/magazine/100000000773719/carving-lamb.html\">how to carve a leg of lamb.</a>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/18/multimedia/recipe-lab-lamb/recipe-lab-lamb-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "anchovies, lamb, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1145}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1047, "unsaturatedFatContent": "47 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "107 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "56 grams", "sodiumContent": "258 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large lamb roast with a cap of fat, 4 to 6 pounds: bone-in leg (these can be as large as 8 pounds), semiboneless leg, bone-in shoulder, boneless butterflied leg or double loin", "2 ounces (1 can) anchovies packed in olive oil, drained, or 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "Leaves from 6 fresh rosemary sprigs (2 heaping tablespoons leaves), plus extra sprigs and branches for garnish", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "4 ounces unsalted butter, softened at room temperature", "Black pepper", "1 lemon, cut in half", "1 3/4 cups white wine, plus extra for gravy"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
