{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Twice-Cooked Mock Tandoori Chicken", "description": "The chicken recipe here, a kind of mock tandoori chicken, mitigates the bane of chicken grilling (or, for that matter, broiling), the roaring flame-up. By braising the chicken first, you effectively remove just about all the surface fat, practically eliminating the risk of setting the pieces on fire. This same treatment would work nicely with fatty lamb, like chunks of shoulder or even shanks, which without the initial braising would be just about impossible to grill.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/11/dining/tandoori-chicken-thighs-bittman/tandoori-chicken-thighs-bittman-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken thigh, yogurt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 95}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 578, "unsaturatedFatContent": "26 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "820 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 chicken thighs, or thighs and drumsticks", "2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil", "1 medium onion, chopped", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "4 or 5 garlic cloves, smashed", "1 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and chopped (or use 2 teaspoons dried ginger)", "1 tablespoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 tablespoon paprika", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "Cayenne or chopped fresh chiles or crushed red chile flakes to taste, optional", "3 cups plain yogurt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees.
