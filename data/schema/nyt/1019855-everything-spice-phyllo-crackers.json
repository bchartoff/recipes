There's no need for a whisk, mixing bowl or even flour: Just layer phyllo sheets with butter, top with everything-bagel seasoning (or other spices, or grated cheese), and slice them into squares or triangles of any size. Each cracker promises a joyful, shattering mess; a companion to wine, beer or something stronger; and the pleasure of knowing it was so easy to make. Each batch yields a bounty of crackers, but this recipe is also easy to scale.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/18/dining/as-everything-phyllo-crackers/as-everything-phyllo-crackers-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 40 to 60 crackers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, phyllo, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 60}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 sheets frozen phyllo pastry, thawed overnight and kept under a damp towel", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted", "1/4 cup/40 grams everything-bagel seasoning (or make your own using 1 tablespoon dried minced onion, 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds, 2 tablespoons poppy seeds, 1 teaspoon fennel or caraway seeds and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder)", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon flaky sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
