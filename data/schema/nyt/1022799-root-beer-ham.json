{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Root Beer Ham", "description": "Despite its regal countenance, a glazed holiday ham is surprisingly easy to cook \u2014 though \u201ccook\u201d is misleading here, as most supermarket hams already come fully cooked and just need to be heated through in the oven. Here, a bone-in half ham (try not to get the spiral-sliced kind, which can dry out easily) gently bakes in an aromatic pool of shallots, bay leaves and root beer, a variation on the Southern classic made with cola. The root beer braising liquid is reduced with brown sugar and Dijon into a sticky glaze that lacquers the scored ham with caramelized luster. Save the braising liquid and serve alongside to spoon onto slices for even more flavor and juiciness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/12/magazine/12mag-eat-site/12mag-eat-site-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, main course", "keywords": "christmas, ham, root beer, shallots", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1138}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bone-in, fully cooked unsliced half ham (8 to 12 pounds)", "2 (12-ounce) cans root beer", "2 large shallots, halved lengthwise", "2 large dried or fresh bay leaves", "1/4 packed cup dark brown sugar", "4 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "2 teaspoons rice vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
