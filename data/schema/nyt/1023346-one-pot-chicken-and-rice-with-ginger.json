It\u2019s both mild and full of flavor, which might sound contradictory at first, but it delivers subtle notes of fresh ginger, soy sauce and lime, rather than bold hits in each bite. Serve with extra soy sauce and lime on the side, so that everyone can adjust the seasoning as they would like. Fish out the ginger slices at the end or let everyone know they\u2019re there.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/19/dining/nb-one-pot-ginger-chicken-and-rice/nb-one-pot-ginger-chicken-and-rice-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, grains and rice, poultry, main course", "keywords": "boneless chicken thighs, chicken thigh, ginger, jasmine rice, soy sauce", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2969}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons neutral or olive oil", "1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into thin slices", "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts", "Kosher salt\u00a0", "3 large garlic cloves, minced or grated", "2 cups jasmine rice, rinsed with cold water", "3 cups low-sodium chicken broth or water, at room temperature", "3/4 pound quick-cooking greens, such as chard, kale or spinach, leaves removed from thick stems, if needed, and cut or torn into bite-size pieces (about 4 packed cups)", "2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more as needed", "2 limes, 1 juiced (about 1 tablespoon juice) and 1 cut into wedges", "2 scallions (optional), sliced", "1/4 packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems (optional), roughly torn or chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or pot with a lid, heat the oil and ginger slices over medium-high until the oil around the ginger starts to sizzle, 1 to 2 minutes.
