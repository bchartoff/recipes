The no-cook sauce is a 50-50 mix of ricotta and Parmesan, with the zest and juice of one lemon thrown in. That\u2019s it. To make it more filling, add peas, asparagus or spinach in the last few minutes of the pasta boiling, or stir in fresh arugula or watercress with the sauce in Step 3. It\u2019s a weeknight and for-company keeper any way you stir it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/21/dining/11as-pasta-with-ricotta-and-lemon/merlin_155855151_a42a72df-8230-420d-b9b9-d81fe089ff55-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "lemon, parmesan, pasta, ricotta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3231}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt", "1 pound short, ribbed pasta, like gemelli or penne", "1 cup whole-milk ricotta (8 ounces)", "1 cup freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino (2 ounces), plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest plus 1/4 cup lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)", "Black pepper", "Red-pepper flakes, for serving", "1/4 cup thinly sliced or torn basil leaves, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
