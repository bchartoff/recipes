{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Puppy Chow", "description": "This delightfully messy Midwestern treat is simple enough for kids to make: Just toss crispy cereal with melted peanut butter and chocolate, then dust with lots of confectioners\u2019 sugar. The recipe\u2019s origins are murky, but puppy chow, or muddy buddies, can probably be traced back to recipe pamphlets and community cookbooks from the 1960s. Unlike the version on the back of the Chex cereal box, this recipe calls for a whole box of cereal and for cooling the chocolate-coated cereal a bit, which encourages clusters to form and helps the sugar stick. The cooled cereal is then tossed with confectioners\u2019 sugar on a baking sheet for even coverage. There are many additions to consider: popcorn, chocolate chips, pretzels, nuts, mini marshmallows \u2014 the list goes on.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/20/dining/as-puppy-chow/merlin_195253929_1ffe6ad5-67bf-4211-b302-fd3fbb567277-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "12 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, snack, candies, finger foods, dessert", "keywords": "chex cereal, chocolate, peanut butter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 843}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (12-ounce) box of Chex, Crispix or similar cereal (about 11 cups)", "1 1/2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips or 10 ounces/283 grams chopped bittersweet chocolate", "3/4 cup creamy peanut butter", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)", "1 1/2 cups/185 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "Kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the cereal in a large bowl.
