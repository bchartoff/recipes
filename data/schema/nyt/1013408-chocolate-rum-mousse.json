First, it invoked nearly every food trend of its moment: chocolate desserts were an exotic new fix; any respectable grown-up dessert contained rum; mousse suggested that you understood French cooking, or at least pretended to; two cups of cream was de rigueur; and the recipe assumed you owned one of the kitchen\u2019s latest appliances, the home blender. Second, the newfangled blender actually did make the recipe a wonder of efficiency: all you had to do was layer the ingredients and blend, and a dinner-party mousse was yours.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/16/dining/Chocolate-Rum-Mousse/Chocolate-Rum-Mousse-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6M", "recipeYield": "Serves 8", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, project", "keywords": "dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 87}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 388, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "23 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "85 milligrams", "sugarContent": "21 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup cold whole milk", "1 envelope unflavored gelatin", "3/4 cup milk, heated to boiling", "6 tablespoons dark rum", "1 large egg", "1/4 cup sugar", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "1 6-ounce package (1 cup) semisweet chocolate pieces", "2 cups heavy cream", "2 ice cubes", "1 teaspoon vanilla"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the cold milk and gelatin in blender.
