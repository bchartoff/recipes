{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chocolate Chip Pancakes", "description": "Here\u2019s a clever trick for making a big batch of pancakes that will save you from spending all morning at the stove: Bake them all at once on a sheet pan. In this recipe, the batter comes together like biscuit dough by cutting the cold butter into the flour before adding the liquid. This cuts down on gluten production, which means fluffier pancakes. For wonderfully crisp edges, heat the sheet pan in advance, so the batter starts cooking as soon as it\u2019s poured into the pan. If you like, you can stir a teaspoon of vanilla extract into the batter, sprinkle it with finely chopped fruit, or mix and match toppings to please the crowd.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/14/dining/jg-sheet-pan-pancakes/jg-sheet-pan-pancakes-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, easy, pancakes", "keywords": "butter, buttermilk, chocolate chips, maple syrup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 872}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus 8 tablespoons/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 1/2-inch cubes and chilled", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters cold buttermilk", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters cold whole milk", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cup/125 grams mini chocolate chips", "Maple syrup, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
