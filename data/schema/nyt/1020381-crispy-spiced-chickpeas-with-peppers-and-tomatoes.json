You will need two sheet pans to make it, but that\u2019s about all the kitchen equipment necessary. On one of them, spice-coated chickpeas are roasted until golden and crisp, while juicy peppers, tomatoes and onions caramelize on the other. Handfuls of bright fresh herbs and sweet pomegranate seeds add color and crunch. Serve this by itself for a light dinner, or with couscous or rice for something more substantial.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/dining/mc-spiced-chickpeas/merlin_155267130_4c7191d3-838b-40dc-bfa9-80c03267eb7c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, grains and rice, salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "bell pepper, chickpea, couscous, cumin, herbs, pomegranate seeds, thyme, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 418}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed and patted dry", "1/2 cup olive oil", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste", "6 fresh thyme sprigs", "2 red, orange or yellow bell peppers (or a combination), stems and seeds removed, sliced lengthwise 1/4-inch thick", "2 medium tomatoes, diced", "1 small red onion, sliced", "2 jalape\u00f1os, stem and seeds removed, sliced", "Juice of 1 lemon", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or mashed to a paste", "1 cup fresh herbs (any combination of parsley, cilantro, mint or dill)", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds", "Couscous or rice, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees and arrange racks on the top and bottom thirds of the oven."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, toss chickpeas with 2 tablespoons oil, the cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon salt until evenly coated.
