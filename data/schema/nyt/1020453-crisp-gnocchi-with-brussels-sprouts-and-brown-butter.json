The key to this recipe is how you cook the store-bought gnocchi: No need to boil. Just sear them until they are crisp and golden on the outside, and their insides will stay chewy. The resulting texture is reminiscent of fried dough. Shelf-stable and refrigerated gnocchi will both work here, but the shelf-stable ones do crisp up a bit better.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/dining/as-crisp-gnocchi-with-brussels-sprouts/as-crisp-gnocchi-with-brussels-sprouts-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, pastas, vegetables", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, gnocchi, honey, lemon, parmesan, red pepper flakes, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3240}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound brussels sprouts (or cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower or even cabbage)", "1 lemon", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 (18-ounce) package shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces", "1/2 teaspoon honey", "Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim and halve the brussels sprouts.
