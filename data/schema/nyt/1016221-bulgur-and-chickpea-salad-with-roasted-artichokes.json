{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bulgur and Chickpea Salad With Roasted Artichokes", "description": "Quartering and roasting the artichokes instead of steaming them whole intensifies flavor and cuts down on preparation time for this salad.\nMy initial idea here was to stuff the artichokes with the salad and steam them. But that took a lot of time, and diminished the flavor of the salad. So I trimmed and cut the artichokes into wedges, tossed them with olive oil and roasted them. The roasted artichokes tasted so wonderful that I\u2019ll be inclined to cook them this way from now onhereon in. They are perfect served atop or on the side of this lemony grain, chickpea and herb salad.\n<i>The bulgur will keep for 4 or 5 days in the refrigerator, and can be frozen. The artichokes can be roasted several hours or even a day ahead but are best when freshly roasted.<i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/05/science/08recipehealth/08recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, dairy-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 40}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 523, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "18 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "1147 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium-size or 2 large artichokes , trimmed", "1 lemon, cut in half", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 cup medium (No. #2) bulgur", "Salt, preferably kosher salt, to taste", "2 cups water", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice", "1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "1/3 cup extra- virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup finely chopped parsley, or  (more to taste)", "2 tablespoons chopped chives or green onions", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint", "1 15-ounce can chick peas, drained and rinsed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
