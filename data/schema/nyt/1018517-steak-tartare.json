I can\u2019t speak to that, but a hand-chopped mound of cold raw beef, seasoned perfectly, at around\u00a03 o\u2019clock\u00a0in the afternoon on New Year\u2019s Day, with a cold glass of the hair of the Champagne dog that bit you the night before, will make a new man out of you.\u00a0The strong-flavored pumpernickel bread is a family nostalgia that has become a beloved preference.
