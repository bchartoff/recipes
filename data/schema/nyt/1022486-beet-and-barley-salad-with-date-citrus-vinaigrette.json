Bitter and tart greens, like arugula, crunchy romaine and celery, pair well with shallots or red onion, dates, dried figs, a handful of multicolored olives and crisp, refreshing cucumbers. About a cup of cooked barley adds chew, but you could use lentils or chickpeas instead for more protein. If you can find them, heirloom varieties of barley add wonderful nutty complexity. Beets \u2014 used in ancient times more for the leaves than the roots \u2014 currants and green grapes lend color and sweetness, as well as a pomegranate, the symbol of fruitfulness by virtue of its many seeds.\u00a0All these foods are symbolic of fertility, abundance, and prosperity in the New Year.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/01/dining/30Rosh1/merlin_193667721_54a1b5de-b3c3-4ef8-8a0a-fe4df37fc47a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "barley, beets, date honey, figs, pomegranate, rosh hashana, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 263}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 medium beets, scrubbed", "1/2 cup pearl barley", "Coarse kosher salt", "1 lemon", "1 garlic clove, minced", "2 teaspoons date honey (also labeled date syrup)", "Freshly ground black pepper", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 handfuls of mixed slightly bitter lettuce, like chicory, arugula, romaine, Swiss chard or beet leaves, roughly torn", "1 cup fresh mixed herbs, like mint, thyme, oregano, parsley, hyssop, lovage and cilantro", "2 celery stalks, cut down the center and diced in 1/2-inch pieces", "1 to 2 Persian cucumbers, scrubbed and cut into 1-inch dice", "2 large shallots or 1/2 red onion, diced in 1/2-inch pieces (see Tip)", "5 dried figs or 4 fresh figs, quartered", "1 cup white or red grapes, or a combination, halved", "1 cup mixed pitted olives, halved", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds", "1/2 cup crumbled feta"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
