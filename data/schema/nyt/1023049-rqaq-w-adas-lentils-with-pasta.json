{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rqaq w Adas (Lentils With Pasta)", "description": "In Arabic, adas are lentils, and rqaq is a flatbread as thin and nearly as sheer as paper. The two come together in this stew, which was traditionally a way to use dough left over from baking bread, as the Palestinian artist and chef Mirna Bamieh explains. The lentils are simmered with cumin, bringing its stealthy warmth, along with bronzed onions, tamarind and sweet-sour pomegranate molasses. Meanwhile, scraps of dough are rolled out, then up into cylinders and slashed into long, skinny strands that look like tagliatelle. But you don\u2019t have to wait for baking day: Instead, just knead together the quick dough below or swap in dried pasta. The noodles are dropped right in the pot, to cook among the lentils, leaching starch and making the stew even richer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ligaya Mishan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/27/dining/27EAT-rqaq-q-adas-lentils-with-pasta1/27EAT-rqaq-q-adas-lentils-with-pasta1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, beans, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, flatbread, lentils, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 459}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling\u00a0\u00a0", "1/3 cup warm water", "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing", "Canola or other neutral oil, for frying (optional)", "3 to 4 flatbreads, such as pitas, cut into 3/4-inch squares (optional)", "1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced (optional)", "1/2 to 1 cup pomegranate seeds", "1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves", "Olive oil, for drizzling", "2 cups brown lentils", "Warm water, as needed", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\u00a0", "1/2 cup olive oil", "2 medium onions, chopped", "2 tablespoons tamarind concentrate\u00a0", "1 1/2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses\u00a0", "1 tablespoon salt, plus more to taste\u00a0", "6 garlic cloves, minced", "2 cups fresh cilantro, chopped\u00a0", "3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus more to taste (from 2 to 3 lemons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put lentils in a medium bowl and add warm water to cover by 2 inches.
