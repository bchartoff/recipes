I switched gears, heading in a French direction. It\u2019s a great dish for feeding a crowd and also reheats beautifully, so it\u2019s worth making the entire batch. Serve with a crisp green salad, juicy wilted spinach or mustard greens, or all-season frozen peas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/25/dining/25KITCHEN1/25KITCHEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, grains and rice", "keywords": "chicken thighs, mushroom, rice, white wine, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2041}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 579, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "27 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "898 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch chunks", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 large onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 large sprig thyme, plus 1 teaspoon freshly chopped leaves", "1 bay leaf", "1 cup white wine", "2 cups basmati rice, soaked for 20 minutes, rinsed and drained", "8 ounces king trumpet mushrooms, or a mixture of mushrooms, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "4 cups hot chicken broth", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup frozen peas, cooked for 2 minutes in salted water (optional)", "2 small garlic cloves, smashed to a paste with a little salt", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put chicken pieces on a baking sheet and season generously with salt and pepper.
