{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Cauliflower With Pancetta, Olives and Crisp Parmesan", "description": "Studded with salty olives, pancetta and Parmesan that gets golden and crisp at the edges, this is roasted cauliflower at its brightest and most full-flavored. You can serve the caramelized florets either as a vegetable-based main dish or a hearty side to roasted meats or fish, or big bowls of pasta. The recipe calls for using a package of finely diced pancetta that practically melts into the sauce. But if you prefer a chunkier texture, you can dice it yourself into 1/2-inch cubes, and add them with the cauliflower. Or, to make this vegetarian, just leave the pancetta out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/22/dining/09apperex/merlin_177909345_7c80c18c-0d09-4da0-bb1d-7b76cdb63caf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "2 main-dish servings or 4 side-dish servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, for two, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "bacon, cauliflower, cumin seeds, olives, pancetta, parmesan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 4963}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large head cauliflower (about 1 3/4 pounds), trimmed and cut into bite-size florets (about 8 cups)", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup olives, crushed, pitted and chopped", "1 fat garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1/8 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed", "4 ounces pancetta or bacon, cut into 1/8-inch cubes", "3/4 teaspoon cumin or caraway seeds", "1/2 cup shredded (not ground) Parmesan", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley or mint leaves and tender stems, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
