{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Spaghetti With Caramelized Onions and Herbs", "description": "Except perhaps for the fresh herbs, you probably have all the necessary ingredients to make this incredibly flavorful, easy pasta. The caramelized onions add sweetness to the salty olives and Parmesan, while red chile and garlic make the dish's flavors pungent and deep. A squeeze of fresh lemon right at the end brightens everything, adding a mild tang. Feel free to play around with the basic formula, swapping capers or even a small tin of sardines or tuna for olives, vinegar for the lemon, arugula or spinach for the parsley, and other cheeses (feta or pecorino) for the Parmesan.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/dining/03Appe1/merlin_143727540_b02861fe-df6f-4fc4-8cb4-441940147547-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "anchovies, basil, olives, parsley, spaghetti, main course, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 419}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 536, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "73 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "479 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt, as needed", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large white or Spanish onions, halved and very thinly sliced", "12 ounces spaghetti", "6 garlic cloves", "1/2 teaspoon chile paste or red-pepper flakes, or to taste", "2 anchovies, chopped (optional)", "1 cup chopped mix of parsley and basil (or use all parsley)", "1/3 cup chopped cured Moroccan or other intensely flavored black olives", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed", "Lemon wedges, for squeezing", "Grated Parmesan, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put a large pot of heavily salted water on and let it come to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, cook the onions: Heat 1/4 cup oil\u00a0in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat.
