Fiery with horseradish and Creole mustard -- Zatarain's was the brand Claiborne recommended -- the sauce also contains finely chopped heart of celery, green onion and a splash of good oil. Paprika adds a further touch of spice and a fine red color. Claiborne recommended allowing the dish to cure overnight in the refrigerator. This remains good advice.
