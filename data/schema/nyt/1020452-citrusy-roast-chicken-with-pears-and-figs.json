{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Citrusy Roast Chicken With Pears and Figs", "description": "This juicy, citrus-scented chicken is a perfect dish for that shoulder season between summer and fall, when pears and figs overlap in the market, and evenings cool down enough to turn on the oven. As the chicken roasts, its skin crisps and its fat renders, flavoring the caramelizing fruit in the pan. Before it\u2019s served, everything is topped with a garlicky orange relish flecked with parsley and drizzled with sherry vinegar. It\u2019s a sweet and savory meal that\u2019s simple enough for a weeknight (if you can marinate the chicken the night before), yet festive enough for guests.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/13apperex/merlin_160426923_c5699468-f01c-4f9b-8996-08d3a901a54d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, fig, garlic, orange, pear, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 326}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 garlic cloves", "1 large orange", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary, plus 2 whole sprigs", "2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) whole chicken, patted dry", "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling", "8 seckel pears, halved and cored (or use 4 small ripe Bartlett, Anjou or other pears, quartered)", "8 ounces ripe fresh figs (4 to 6 figs), halved lengthwise", "Sherry vinegar, for serving", "Flaky sea salt, for serving", "1/2 cup parsley leaves, coarsely chopped, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Peel 2 of the garlic cloves, and finely grate or mash to a paste.
