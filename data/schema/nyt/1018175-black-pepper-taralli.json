The taralli will seem chewy when they come out of the oven, but as they cool and dry out, they will become crumbly, like shortbread.\u00a0\nServe with drinks, preferably something light with a little sweetness, like a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/dining/wine-school-assignment-rose.html\">ros\u00e9</a>, a <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/1003735-make-use-of-that-unopened-bottle-of-champagne-in-the-fridge\">Champagne cocktail</a> or an <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013293-venetian-spritz\">Italian Spritz</a>.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/15/dining/15CRACKERS1/15CRACKERS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 5 dozen", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods", "keywords": "00 flour, semolina flour, white wine, appetizer, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 148}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 67, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "3 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "38 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/250 grams semolina flour or unbleached all-purpose flour", "2 1/4 cups/250 grams Italian \u201c00\u201d flour or cake flour", "1 tablespoon/15 grams kosher salt", "3 tablespoons/15 grams black pepper, coarsely ground\u00a0", "1/4 teaspoon/1 gram active dry yeast", "7/8 cup/200 milliliters olive oil", "3/4 cup/175 milliliters white wine"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a standing mixer, whisk together dry ingredients.\u00a0Add oil and half\u00a0the wine.\u00a0Use the paddle attachment to mix on medium-low speed for 12 minutes, adding remaining wine occasionally.
