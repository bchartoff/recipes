{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato Soup With Indian Spices", "description": "This easy vegetarian soup is surprisingly full flavored. (To make it vegan, substitute cooking oil for the butter and ghee.) If you want it more stewlike, use less water; if you want it brothy, use more. It keeps well and actually tastes even better a day or two after it is made. I like to add a pinch of asafetida (also called hing), which can be found in specialty spice shops or Indian groceries and lends a heady aroma that is especially good with potato dishes. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have it on hand. More important are the sizzled cumin seeds, mustard seeds and garlic (the tarka) added when the soup is finished, which really give the soup its character. If you find the soup too thick upon reheating, just add a splash of water and adjust the salt as necessary.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/dining/08Tanisrex-soup/merlin_172154826_1aebf73c-f216-4e88-a0d8-d06d6b985b36-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "celery, cumin, garlic, ghee, ginger, potato, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 392}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 medium onions, diced", "Kosher salt", "3 medium carrots, diced", "3 celery stalks, diced", "1 teaspoon turmeric powder", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder", "1/2 teaspoon asafetida (optional)", "2 pounds Yukon Gold or other yellow-fleshed potato, in 1-inch chunks", "1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro, for garnish", "Lime wedges, for garnish", "2 tablespoons ghee or neutral oil", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds", "1 small green chile, chopped (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put butter in a heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium-high heat.
