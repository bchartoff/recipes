{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Potato Hash", "description": "I had one of the great breakfasts of my life on San Juan Island, north of Seattle, in a dockside coffee shop The grated hash brown potatoes there were cooked in thin sheets and run under the broiler beneath a handful of grated cheese to create crisp pancakes that could be used as a platter on which to serve fried eggs, or as a hat to top them, depending on your mood. When I got home to New York I started making them for dinner, which was labor-intensive and eventually annoying because one of my children wanted them for dinner all the time. Together we worked out a hack. It is this recipe, and you can easily double, and serve with just about anything, especially fried eggs. Omit the bacon if it's not your game, and replace with a couple of tablespoons of butter. Omit the red peppers if you like. Add a drizzle of chipotle mayonnaise on top, if you don\u2019t like sour cream, or swap out the chipotle for nothing if you don\u2019t like spice. Make the recipe your own. The point is simply to aim for a thick, caramelized crust of potatoes. The interiors will be soft and sweet.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/07/magazine/07eat/07mag-07eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, mexican", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch", "keywords": "side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 379}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 366, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "32 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "632 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 slices bacon, ideally double-smoked or slab", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 pounds medium-size Yukon Gold potatoes, approximately 5 potatoes, scrubbed and diced", "1 medium-size yellow onion, peeled and diced", "1 medium-size red bell pepper, seeded and diced", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1 lime, juiced", "1 to 2 tablespoons chipotles en adobo, minced, to taste", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese", "2 scallions, sliced thin, green parts only"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the bacon on a large rimmed baking sheet, place in the oven and heat to 400.
