{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Pork Stew With Hominy and Collard Greens", "description": "I\u2019ve long adored hominy, the earthy dried corn kernels you find in pozole, the chile-laced Mexican stew. When I saw dried heirloom hominy for sale online, I bought some. I knew that having it in the cupboard when a hominy craving struck was the best insurance against cheating and buying the canned version.\n\nLike dried beans, dried hominy needs a good long soak and a lengthy cooking. But there\u2019s nothing difficult about the process.\n\nMany pozole recipes call for the finished stew to be garnished with shredded cabbage. But after bingeing on cabbage recently, I decided to take a different route, and stirred slivered collard greens into the pot at the end of cooking. They turned silky and soft and offered a nice contrast to the chewy hominy, the brawny pork and the spicy thick broth.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/21/dining/21APPE_SPAN/21APPE_SPAN-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "collard greens, hominy, pork, dairy-free, main course, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 256}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 606, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "43 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "803 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound dried hominy", "3 pounds boneless pork butt, cut into 2-inch-square chunks", "1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "3 tablespoons peanut or safflower oil", "2 yellow onions, finely chopped", "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon New Mexican chile powder (or less, to taste)", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon Mexican oregano", "1 bay leaf", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 chipotle in adobo sauce", "1 (12-ounce) bottle lager-style beer", "2 pounds collard greens (about 2 bunches), center rib removed, leaves chopped", "Lime wedges, for serving", "Cilantro leaves, for serving", "Diced avocado, for serving", "Diced radish for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the hominy in plenty of water overnight.
