{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Blender Chocolate Mousse", "description": "This recipe for chocolate mousse made in a blender comes via the pastry chef Natasha Pickowicz, who got it from a cook named Monica Stolbach, who in turn got it from her mother-in-law, who got it from a Junior League cookbook published in the 1980s. Straightforward, adaptable and extremely satisfying, it\u2019s one of those recipes that you want to pass along to as many people as you can. Instead of separating the egg yolks and whites, this technique simply involves pouring hot sugar syrup into a blender with chocolate and whole eggs, then folding that mixture into softly whipped cream. The resulting texture is so creamy and rich, it doesn\u2019t need anything at all, though you can top it with extra whipped cream, if you like.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/02/magazine/02mag-eat/02mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "About 8 servings (7 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, custards and puddings", "keywords": "chocolate, dark chocolate, espresso, heavy cream, rum, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 994}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups heavy cream", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "12 ounces dark chocolate, roughly chopped", "4 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/4 cup strong (brewed) espresso (or very strongly brewed coffee)", "1/4 cup light or dark rum (or Marsala or brandy)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, or in a stand mixer on medium speed, whip the heavy cream to glossy, medium peaks, about 5 minutes.
