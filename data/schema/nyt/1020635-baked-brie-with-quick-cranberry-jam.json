{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Brie With Quick Cranberry Jam", "description": "Likely to be a hit at any party, this recipe updates the classic brie en croute with a sweet and savory cranberry jam that\u2019s simple to put together. The trick here is to trim the dough as you wrap the brie: Too many layers of overlapping dough and the pastry won\u2019t cook through. This is an excellent make-ahead appetizer since the puff pastry-wrapped brie can be assembled up to a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Brush the exterior with egg wash just before baking, for best results, and serve warm.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/15/dining/lh-baked-brie/merlin_164331324_42a115ee-58e2-49d6-96b4-5196d5171f7b-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "finger foods, pastries", "keywords": "appetizer, brie, cheese, cranberry, honey, orange juice, pistachio, puff pastry, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 285}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots (about 2 shallots)", "1 cup whole fresh cranberries or frozen cranberries", "1 teaspoon freshly grated orange zest and 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (from about 1 orange)", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1 sheet puff pastry (about 8 ounces), defrosted and chilled", "1 (8-ounce) wheel of brie", "1 large <strong></strong>egg", "Honey, for serving (optional)", "Finely chopped pistachios, for serving (optional)", "Baguette slices or crackers, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat.
