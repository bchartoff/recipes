They go very well with seafood, and some raw, shell-\u200bon shrimp stir-\u200bfried along with the garlic right from the start would be an excellent addition. Recently, I\u2019ve taken to adding a few spoonfuls of tarako or mentaiko \u2014 \u200bJapanese salted pollock roe. Sushi-\u200bstyle flying fish roe (tobiko) or salmon roe (ikura) would also be a great addition, as would chunks of crab or lobster meat, or even Western-\u200bstyle caviar (if you\u2019re feeling flush).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
