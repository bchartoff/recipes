It calls for oven-roasted tomatoes slicked with olive oil and fragrant with lime, as well as kale cooked soft in parts and crunchy in others, the pure mineral intensity of the greens bracketed by soy sauce and shavings of coconut. The dressing \u2013 ginger, miso, tahini, honey, olive oil, lime juice and chopped hot pepper \u2013 is a far thicker mixture than vinaigrette, one that lends itself better to drizzling over the bowl.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/dining/ss-warm-kale-salad/merlin_148333509_26952b3d-69be-4e08-90a1-c22259291d94-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "coconut, kale, miso paste, serrano pepper, tahini, tomato, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 579}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 254, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "595 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 ounces cherry tomatoes, approximately 1 pint basket", "3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste", "2 to 3 limes, well scrubbed if waxed", "12 ounces green or purple kale, approximately 2 heads, lower stalks removed and leaves torn into pieces", "1/4 cup unsweetened dehydrated shaved coconut", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 inch fresh ginger root, peeled and grated, approximately 1 tablespoon", "1 tablespoon white miso paste", "1 tablespoon tahini", "1 tablespoon honey", "1 red serrano or jalape\u00f1o pepper, finely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425.
