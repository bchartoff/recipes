Carefully open it to check for doneness. The mushrooms should be tender and juicy. Either transfer to plates or bowls (there will be lots of juice), or cut the packets and eat the mushrooms directly from them. Have lots of crusty bread on hand to sop up the juices."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013237-grilled-mushrooms-in-foil-packets"}
