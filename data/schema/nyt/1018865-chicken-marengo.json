{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Marengo\u00a0", "description": "In the middle of June 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte's troops were engaged in battle with Austrian forces near the small village of Marengo in northern Italy. The battle was fierce, or so the legend has it, and Napoleon, of course, emerged victorious. And hungry. He asked his chef to prepare a meal quickly and the cook scoured the countryside looking for foods to prepare. He scurried around and discovered a chicken, olive oil, tomatoes, herbs, eggs and crawfish. Within minutes, a fire was started and the chef prepared a quick saut\u00e9 of the chicken with tomatoes, oil and herbs. It is said that he garnished the dish before serving it with a fried egg and crawfish. In my version, the chicken, cut into serving pieces, is simply browned in a little olive oil (I add a touch of butter to give it flavor) on both sides. I then prefer to add sliced mushrooms (there are those who declare that truffles were among the original ingredients), seasonings, wine, tomatoes and parsley and cook covered until done, about 10 minutes longer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pierre Franey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/17/dining/17COOKING-CHICKEN2/19COOKING-CHICKEN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "poultry", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1228}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 703, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1465 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3-pound chicken cut into serving pieces", "Salt to taste, if desired\u00a0", "Freshly ground pepper, to taste\u00a0", "2 tablespoons butter\u00a0", "2 tablespoons olive oil\u00a0", "1 1/2 cups thinly sliced mushrooms (about\u00a01/2 pound)", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion\u00a0", "1/2 teaspoon finely minced garlic\u00a0", "1\u00a0bay leaf\u00a0", "2 sprigs fresh thyme or\u00a01/2 teaspoon dried\u00a0", "1/2 cup dry white wine\u00a0", "2 cups cored and cubed red ripe tomatoes, or use canned tomatoes\u00a0", "1/4 cup tomato paste\u00a0", "1/2 cup chicken broth\u00a0", "2 sprigs fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper to taste."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the butter and oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
