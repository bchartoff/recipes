{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "45-Minute Roast Turkey", "description": "In 2002, Mark Bittman published this revolutionary approach to roasting the Thanksgiving turkey, which allows you to cut the cooking time of the average turkey by about 75 percent while still presenting an attractive bird. Simply cut out the backbone \u2014\u00a0or ask your butcher to do it for you \u2014 and spread the bird out flat before roasting, a technique known as spatchcocking that is commonly used with chickens. Roasted at 450 degrees, a 10-pound bird will be done in about 45 minutes. Really. It will also be more evenly browned (all of the skin is exposed to the heat), more evenly cooked, and moister than birds cooked conventionally.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/27/dining/27COOKING-ROASTTURKEY/27COOKING-ROASTTURKEY-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, roasts", "keywords": "main course, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 741}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 532, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "70 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1082 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 8- to 12-pound turkey", "10 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed, more to taste", "1 branch fresh tarragon or thyme separated into sprigs, or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme or tarragon", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil or butter", "Salt and pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
