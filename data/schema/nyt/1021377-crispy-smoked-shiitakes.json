{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Smoked Shiitakes", "description": "Most vegetable charcuterie involves several days of curing and smoking, but these crispy smoked shiitakes \u2014 mushroom bacon, if you will \u2014 can be made from start to finish in less than a half hour. The recipe comes from a terrific vegan restaurant in Washington D.C., called Fancy Radish, by way of the chef and co-owner Rich Landau. It involves a two-step process: First you fry thinly sliced shiitakes to make them crisp, then you smoke them to make them taste like bacon. You can do the smoking in your smoker or a charcoal grill, or indoors with a handheld or stovetop smoker. You\u2019ll love the crisp crunch and rich, baconlike mouthfeel, with a smoky flavor that\u2019s similar to bacon\u2019s but with distinct mushroom overtones. Make shiitake crispy smoked shiitakes for a vegan snack or BLT, or serve it with eggs if you eat them.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Steven Raichlen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/26/dining/24charcuterierex3/24charcuterierex3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "shiitake, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 43}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms (pick the largest caps you can find)", "2 cups grapeseed or canola oil, or as needed, for frying", "Hardwood chips, chunks or sawdust, as needed for smoking", "Sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stem the shiitake mushrooms (you can save the stems for stock or another use), then thinly slice the caps into thin strips on a mandolin or by hand.
