{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Red Onion Soup With Cheese Toasts", "description": "Onion soup is an excellent antidote to blustery, cold weather. Jacques P\u00e9pin showed me his way when I first met him years ago in California. His admonishments: Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan or the onions won\u2019t brown. Keep the heat high but not too high, so the onions don\u2019t cook too fast and burn. Be generous with the salt and pepper. Bay leaf and thyme are essential, everything else is negotiable. A little red wine is nice, a splash of Cognac couldn\u2019t hurt. A welcome all-purpose remedy, especially at this time of year.
