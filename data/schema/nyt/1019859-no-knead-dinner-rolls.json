The dough rises slowly for a long time, because the dough needs to gain strength as it rises, which contributes to its structure after baking. The rolls that emerge from the oven have a golden crust that\u2019s lightly crisp, and a soft interior that is best served fresh.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/21/dining/em-no-knead-bread-rolls/merlin_148333197_fb42362e-f3db-4844-ba5b-24395822205e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "9 rolls", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "flour, instant yeast, milk, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 361}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 305, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "227 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 cups/450 grams all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters whole milk, plus 1 to 3 tablespoons, if needed", "7 tablespoons/100 grams unsalted butter, plus more for the pan", "2 large eggs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, stir the flour, sugar, yeast and salt until combined.
