Add the wine, and stir until it is no longer visible in the pan. Begin adding the simmering stock a couple of ladlefuls (about 1/2 cup) at a time. The stock should just cover the rice and should be bubbling neither too slowly nor too quickly. Cook, stirring often, until it is just about absorbed. Add another ladleful or two of the stock, and continue to cook in this fashion, adding more stock and stirring when the rice is almost dry. You do not have to stir constantly, but stir often. After 15 minutes, stir in the turkey and the peas, and continue to add stock as instructed above. The risotto is done in 20 to 25 minutes, when the rice is just tender all the way through but still chewy. Taste now and adjust seasoning."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add another ladleful or two of stock to the rice.
