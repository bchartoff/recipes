It\u2019s best served warm while the bacon still glistens with fat, but is also nice at room temperature. Make it as close to serving time as possible. Or if you do make it ahead, consider popping it into the microwave for a minute or so just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20POTATO4/20POTATO4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "bacon, potato, shallot, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 442}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 188, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "270 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds small waxy white or yellow potatoes, roughly about the same size", "6 ounces thick-cut bacon, diced", "1/2 cup thinly sliced shallot", "3 tablespoons whole grain mustard", "1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "Chopped parsley, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place whole unpeeled potatoes in a large pot with enough salted water to cover by 1 inch.
