{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie", "description": "This spin on an icebox pie, with its chocolaty press-in graham cracker crust and airy no-bake peanut butter filling, comes with a sheen of fudgy glaze. A splash of coffee accentuates the dark side of the bittersweet chocolate, and salted peanuts scattered on top add crunch. As fun as a candy bar and as creamy as a cheesecake, this layered dessert looks and feels special but is simple enough for anyone to pull together. And it\u2019s even easier to serve: The whole thing can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/13/dining/13PIESREX-chocolate-peanut-butter/merlin_214872684_8052ef29-98fc-4bb3-9784-dd93b2ae503a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch pie", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, coffee, corn syrup, cream cheese, dutch-processed cocoa powder, graham cracker, heavy cream, make-ahead, peanut, peanut butter, pie, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 468}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/110 grams graham cracker crumbs (from about 7 crackers)", "1/3 cup/30 grams Dutch-processed (dark) unsweetened cocoa powder", "1/4 cup/30 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine salt", "5 tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "Nonstick cooking spray", "1 1/4 cups/300 grams heavy cream", "1 cup/270 grams creamy peanut butter (see Tip)", "6 ounces/170 grams cream cheese, softened", "3/4 cup/90 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt", "6 tablespoons/85 grams heavy cream", "4 ounces/113 grams bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped", "2 tablespoons hot brewed coffee or hot water", "2 teaspoons light corn syrup", "1/4 cup/40 grams roasted, salted peanuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
