(Here\u2019s </span><a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/5-how-to-make-burgers\"><span>our burger guide</span></a><span> for more information and inspiration.) But sometimes you want a smoky grilled burger. For that, a charcoal grill is best, but a gas grill can do the trick, too. Resist the temptation to press down on the burgers with a spatula, which only spews juice and fat on the fire, causing the flames to flare up and the burger to lose flavor. If you feel your burger is cooking too quickly, use the cooler sides of the grill to rest them. And remember: lowering the top on the grill helps cheese melt.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/13/dining/13COOKING-BURGER/13COOKING-BURGER-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, barbecues, burgers, meat", "keywords": "ground beef, hamburger buns, pepper, salt, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 92}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds ground beef, about 20 percent fat", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "Cheese slices (optional)", "4 hamburger buns, split"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start a charcoal fire or heat a gas grill.
