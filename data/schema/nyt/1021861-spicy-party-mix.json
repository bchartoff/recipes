{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Party Mix", "description": "When a recipe for a seasoned snack mix first appeared on the back of the Chex cereal box in the 1950s, people went crazy for it. Years later, a Google search for the recipe yields more than two million results for various riffs, from savory to spicy to sweet. Many call for tossing the dry ingredients with the wet, then letting the mix dry on paper towels, but baking it at a low temperature yields crisper, more flavorful results. Hot sauce gives this version a bit of a kick, but if you don\u2019t like heat, you can leave it out. View this recipe as a template to tweak as you see fit: Use crunchy, roasted edamame or green peas in place of the nuts, substitute Thai red curry paste or Sriracha for the hot sauce, or double up on whatever ingredients you like best. Keep the dry-to-wet ratios the same and you can\u2019t go wrong.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Margaux Laskey"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/04/dining/ml-party-mix/merlin_183223977_890fbe6c-4c26-476c-9d6d-8db2fabda4d0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 15 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "butter, crackers, hot sauce, nuts, super bowl, tailgate", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 489}, "recipeIngredient": ["9 cups rice, corn or wheat Chex or Crispix cereal, or a combination", "2 cups any kind of lightly salted nut", "2 cups small pretzels", "3 cups add-ins, such as cheese crackers, rice crackers, bagel chips, sesame sticks or a combination", "1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick)", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 to 2 tablespoons hot sauce, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon garlic powder, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon onion powder, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon sweet or smoked paprika", "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and heat to 250 degrees.
