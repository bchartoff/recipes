{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Chicken Potpie", "description": "Using store-bought puff pastry instead of homemade pie crust for a chicken potpie might seem like cheating, but rest assured it\u2019s for the best, adding shatteringly flaky layers that even the best pie crust lacks. This recipe calls for bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts or thighs, so that the chicken fat rendered from searing can serve as the base of the gravy. But for a weeknight-friendly version, shredded rotisserie chicken can be used instead. Just use a tablespoon or two of butter to replace the fat. (A note about store-bought puff pastry: No two brands are the same size, but know that all you need is to cover the surface of the skillet. If it\u2019s larger than expected, feel free to trim or crimp the edges like a pie, and if it seems too small or is a strange shape, simply roll the pastry on a lightly floured surface to increase its dimensions.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/20/dining/20COOKING-CHICKEN-POT-PIE/20COOKING-CHICKEN-POT-PIE-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, puff pastry, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 685}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 425, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "38 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "927 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts or thighs (smaller work better here)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "3 small carrots, thinly sliced (about 6 ounces)", "3 celery stalks, thinly sliced (about 6 ounces)", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "1 tablespoon thyme leaves, coarsely chopped", "1/3 cup all-purpose flour", "3 cups low-sodium chicken broth or stock", "1 cup frozen peas, thawed", "1/4 cup finely chopped parsley", "1 (12-or 14-ounce) sheet (or 2 8\u00bd-ounce sheets pressed together at the edges) frozen puff pastry, thawed, rolled into a 12-inch circle", "1 large egg, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
