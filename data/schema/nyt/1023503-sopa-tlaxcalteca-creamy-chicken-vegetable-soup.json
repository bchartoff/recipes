{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sopa Tlaxcalteca (Creamy Chicken Vegetable Soup)", "description": "Sopa Tlaxcalteca, from the central state of Tlaxcala, is a seasonal chicken soup simmered with ripe local produce like corn, carrots, mushrooms, squash and squash blossoms. What makes it special is the whole milk that is added to the simmering broth. It lends a very slight creaminess that accentuates the sweetness of the vegetables and amps up the richness of the chicken stock. There are many soups in Mexico, but this is easily one of the most comforting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
