Woodsy herbs like thyme and bay leaves, and fresh, raw parsley give the soup its intensely green, almost grassy taste. It\u2019s worth trying the soup without dairy, then admiring the transformative effect of a splash of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or cream, which subdues the louder celery notes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/dining/19celeryrex1/19celeryrex1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings (about 9 1/2 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, soups and stews, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, side dish, bay leaves, celery, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, leek, parsley, russet potatoes, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 229}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "2 large leeks (about 10 ounces each), halved lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise and cleaned (about 3 cups)", "3 garlic cloves, sliced", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound celery (about 1 large bunch), leaves reserved, stalks trimmed, peeled and thinly sliced", "1 large russet potato (about 12 ounces), peeled and roughly chopped", "3 fresh bay leaves", "1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "7 cups chicken or vegetable stock", "1 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves, plus more for garnish", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or heavy cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot, heat the 1/4 cup oil over medium.
