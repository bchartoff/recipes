{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Olive Oil Cake", "description": "This tender chocolate cake has a deep cocoa flavor that\u2019s intensified by the slight bitterness of olive oil. Cinnamon adds a touch of spice here, and the Earl Grey tea, a mellow citrus perfume. Feel free to play around with the hot liquid used to dissolve the cocoa powder: Coffee, red wine, orange juice or any other flavorful tea will add their own notes to the cake, while water will let the chocolate shine on its own. Serve this as is, or with a dollop of whipped cream or some ice cream on top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/24/dining/19HANUKKAHrex1/merlin_197671284_1b96cad0-95eb-4caa-8678-0cbeb36629e1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1721}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/177 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan", "1/2 cup/118 milliliters Earl Grey tea, or use coffee, dry red wine, orange juice or water", "1/2 cup/50 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons/135 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
