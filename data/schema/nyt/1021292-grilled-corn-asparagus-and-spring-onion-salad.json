{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Corn, Asparagus and Spring Onion Salad", "description": "In this cookout perfect salad, corn, asparagus and spring onions benefit from the deep flavors of the grill. Their outer layers get a rustic char, their full sweetness is released, and they go from raw to cooked while maintaining a crunchy bite. Still warm, they\u2019re doused in one of Mexico\u2019s most fun ways to dress grilled vegetables or potato chips, an easy-to-eat sauce where umami, citrus and heat converge. The mixture is typically referred to as salsa preparada, meaning you simply mix these sauces together to \u201cprepare\u201d your food. You may wonder if the soy, Worcestershire and Maggi sauces compete, but each has a different character of saz\u00f3n, which is whisked with plenty of fresh squeezed lime juice and a punch of chile oil. If more heat is desired, you can add a splash of your favorite hot sauce. This salad is great solo as an appetizer, but it is even better served right next to grilled meats.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/10carneasadarex4-cornsalad/merlin_175267191_6580b6b3-e407-4d88-87b0-d0954969c655-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "asparagus, cherry tomatoes, corn, lime, scallion, soy sauce, spring onions, worcestershire sauce, nut-free, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 278}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 ears fresh corn (preferably white corn), shucked and cleaned", "1 bunch asparagus (about 8 ounces), woody ends removed, stalks peeled up to flower bud", "1 bunch spring onions or 2 bunches large scallions (about 8 ounces total), trimmed", "Vegetable oil", "1/4 cup fresh squeezed lime juice (from about 2 limes)", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce", "1 tablespoon Maggi sauce", "1 tablespoon chile oil or hot sauce", "1/2 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, plus more to taste", "1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat grill to high.
