I like the word, so I don\u2019t mind the practice, but this souffl\u00e9 is airy and closer to its Webster\u2019s etymology \u2014 \u2018\u2018a murmuring or blowing sound\u2019\u2019 \u2014 than the appendage suggests. It has less flour than a regular souffl\u00e9. It needs less scaffolding. This souffl\u00e9 is equally good with either vegetable; it can be made hours ahead and will rise again upon reheating.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tamar Adler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/11/magazine/11eat_large/11mag-11eat-t_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch", "keywords": "side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 54}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 372, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "238 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["825 grams or 9-10 cups thinly sliced, white and light green parts of leeks or an equivalent amount of wilted spinach (or saut\u00e9ed zucchini), completely drained in a dish towel and pur\u00e9ed", "125 grams butter divided into 100 grams and 25 grams", "25 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup whole milk", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan", "6 eggs, separated"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sweat the leeks in 100 grams of butter with salt until just barely beginning to brown and totally dry, about 10 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make a b\u00e9chamel by melting the remaining butter in a small pot, then adding the flour, stirring to combine, and then slowly adding the milk, whisking, until it boils and thickens."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Let cook 2 to 3 minutes.
