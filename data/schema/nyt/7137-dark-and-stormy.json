Hamilton waxed poetic about the Dark and Stormy, describing it both as \u201ca drink traditionally associated with sailing and the manly habit of appearing to keep one's balance while determinedly losing it\u201d and as \u201ca spicy and spritzed two-legged, walk-the-decks kind of drink with a lime wedge perched at the top like a pirate's parrot.\u201d This version, adapted from Red Sky, a restaurant on Mount Desert Island in Maine, uses a combination of Gosling\u2019s Black Seal rum and AJ Stephans ginger beer. Simple to prepare \u2014 no shaking or stirring involved \u2014 mix one up and enjoy it on a sweltering summer night. And don't forget the lime wedge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "William L.
