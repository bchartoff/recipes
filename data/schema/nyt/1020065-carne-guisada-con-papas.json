{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Carne Guisada con Papas", "description": "Adapted from Ad\u00e1n Medrano, a Houston-based chef and writer, this steak-and-potato guisada, or stew, uses technique and time to draw out flavor from just a handful of ingredients. Beef and potatoes are centuries-old pantry essentials in South Texas, and this dish is served in homes and family-run restaurants all over the region. While many restaurants tend to cook the steak in large pieces, cutting the meat into small cubes allows the beef to soak up more flavor. The key is the Texas Mexican spice blend \u2014 black peppercorns, cumin and garlic \u2014 plus a little fresh Serrano. Serve with tortillas and an optional garnish of cilantro and chile.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rachel Wharton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/dining/22mexicanrex1/merlin_151791759_4b7356f8-215a-4b11-ba24-8a689f8d0570-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, soups and stews", "keywords": "bottom round steak, serrano chile, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 141}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large garlic cloves, peeled and minced", "1 Serrano chile, minced, plus additional sliced Serrano for garnish (optional)", "15 whole black peppercorns", "1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds", "2 tablespoons canola oil", "1 1/2 pounds bottom round steak or beef chuck, fat trimmed and meat cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "1 large white onion, halved and sliced 1/4-inch thick", "1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour", "Kosher salt", "2 medium waxy potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes", "Warmed corn or flour tortillas, for serving", "Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use a mortar and pestle to mash the garlic, minced chile, peppercorns and cumin seeds into a smooth paste.
