{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Glazed Sweet Potatoes", "description": "Less sugary than traditional <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021600-candied-yams\">candied yams</a>, these sweet potatoes rely on the natural sweetness of pineapple juice, with just a hint of brown sugar to form a syrup that\u2019s flavored with vanilla and cinnamon. The pineapple adds some tangy acidity that further balances the sweetness of the potatoes and the syrup that coats them. By parboiling the sweet potatoes before baking them in this recipe (which can be done a day or two ahead), you\u2019re cutting down the cook time \u2014 and ensuring that you\u2019ll get fork-tender spuds. This dish is finished on the stovetop, which helps the syrup to thicken and come together quickly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Vallery Lomas"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/26/dining/vl-pineapple-sweet-potatoes/vl-pineapple-sweet-potatoes-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, weeknight, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "dark brown sugar, light brown sugar, pineapple juice, sweet potato, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 111}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds total)", "3/4 cup pineapple juice", "1/4 cup packed light or dark brown sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash and peel the sweet potatoes, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick disks.
