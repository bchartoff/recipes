{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Summer Squash Scampi", "description": "While scampi is a type of crustacean (also known as langoustines), the word has also come to refer to the <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9101-classic-shrimp-scampi\">garlicky lemon-butter sauce</a> that drapes shrimp at Italian American restaurants. But what if you lost the shellfish altogether? When summer squash is sliced and cooked only part way, they have a juicy snap similar to shrimp, no mushiness. This rendition also maintains the lively flavors of garlic and lemon, which are only slightly mellowed by the residual heat of the sauce. Eat with pasta or crusty bread, or as a side dish to any summery meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/27/dining/as-summer-squash-scampi/merlin_206068053_2f6b9f45-db5d-433b-8eef-583152095e17-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "garlic, lemon, white wine, zucchini, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1000}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds zucchini or other summer squash, sliced into \u00bd-inch-thick rounds", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "Neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1 garlic clove, finely chopped", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 cup white wine", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed and cold", "1 tablespoon lemon juice (from half a lemon)", "1 tablespoon chopped parsley, mint or basil leaves (or \u00bd tablespoon chopped tarragon leaves)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Arrange the squash in a single layer and sprinkle with \u00be teaspoon salt.
