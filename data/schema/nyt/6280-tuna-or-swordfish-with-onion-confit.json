While fish is grilling, stir olives and tomatoes into onions, and raise heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes liquefy and mixture becomes juicy. Taste, and adjust seasoning. Serve fish on a bed of onion confit, whole fish cut into serving portions."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6280-tuna-or-swordfish-with-onion-confit"}
