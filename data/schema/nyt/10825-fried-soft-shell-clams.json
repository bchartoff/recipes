Drain and place the clams in a bowl of cold water. When cool, open each shell and remove the clam. Use a small knife to cut out any that adhere. Discard the black mantle covering the neck. Soak the clams in a bowl with evaporated milk or buttermilk."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a heavy skillet or deep fryer, heat the oil to 360 degrees. Meanwhile, remove the clams from the milk and drain. Combine the flour, masa harina, baking powder and salt. When the oil is hot, toss the clams in the flour mixture to coat. Shake off any loose flour and immediately put the clams into the oil. Do not let floured clams sit or they will not be crisp when fried. In a minute or two, when the clams are a little darker than cornflakes, remove them, drain on paper towels and serve with tartar sauce."}]}
