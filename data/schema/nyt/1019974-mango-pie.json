{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mango Pie", "description": "When Hrishikesh Hirway was a kid, his parents, who immigrated to the United States from Maharashtra, in western India, began hosting Thanksgiving. The meal soon evolved into a hybrid of a traditional Thanksgiving and an Indian potluck. \u201cOut of that cultural mash-up, my mom started making this mango pie,\u201d he said. She\u2019d gotten the idea from other Indian aunties in the States, but their versions weren\u2019t as good. \u201cThey weren\u2019t making it with the best kind of mango,\u201d Hirway explained. \u201cThe Alphonsos have a stronger, more intense flavor.\u201d That Alphonso flavor shines as brilliantly as the pie\u2019s bright filling, made tangy and rich with the addition of cream cheese and whipped cream. And the salty, crumbly graham cracker crust is the perfect foundation for the golden cloud of custard that sits atop it. It\u2019s so satisfying that you'll catch yourself cutting sliver after mouthwatering sliver of pie.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/10/magazine/10mag-eat-slide-SXXG/10mag-eat-slide-SXXG-articleLarge.png", "totalTime": "PT5H50M", "recipeYield": "2 9-inch pies", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "cardamom, gelatin, graham cracker crumbs, mango pur\u00e9e, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 746}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 cups (280 grams) finely ground graham-cracker crumbs", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 large pinch sea salt", "9 tablespoons (128 grams) unsalted butter, melted", "3/4 cup cold water", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons plus 1/4 teaspoon powdered gelatin (2 1/2 packages at 2 1/2 teaspoons per pack)", "1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled", "4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature", "1 30-ounce can Alphonso mango pur\u00e9e (3 1/4 cups)", "1 large pinch sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir crumbs, sugar, cardamom and salt together in a medium bowl.
