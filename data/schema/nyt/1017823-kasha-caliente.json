{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kasha Caliente", "description": "It was a love of kasha and memories of family that inspired Nancy Jane Richer of Knoxville, Tenn., to create this holiday recipe. Ms. Richer\u2019s father loved kasha and died on Thanksgiving more than a decade ago. Recently, Ms. Richer spotted wild turkeys in her winter vegetable garden. For her, it felt like a message. \u201cIt was a magical omen,\u201d Ms. Richer said. The result is this spicy take on kasha, created in memory of Ms. Richer\u2019s parents. The dish is robust enough to eat as a vegetarian main course, but also tempting as a side dish for everyone at the table.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/13/science/wellkasha/wellkasha-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "main course, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 48}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 495, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "48 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "796 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups vegetable broth", "1 cup kasha", "3 eggs, lightly beaten", "4 tablespoons butter", "2 large sweet onions, chopped", "4 large cloves of garlic, chopped", "12 ounce package frozen vegetable crumbles, MorningStar Farms brand, or similar", "2 large scallions, chopped", "16 oz. can of Mexicorn, drained", "16 oz. can fire roasted tomatoes, drained", "16 oz. can chili hot kidney beans, drained", "Juice and zest of 1 lime", "1 cup roasted salted pumpkin seeds", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon chili powder", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "1 teaspoon roasted dry cumin", "1 teaspoon dry cilantro leaves", "2 teaspoons garlic salt", "1 tablespoon dry Italian seasoning", "1 cup chile lime garlic tomatillo salsa", "2 cups Italian style shredded cheese blend"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium pot, bring vegetable broth to a boil.
