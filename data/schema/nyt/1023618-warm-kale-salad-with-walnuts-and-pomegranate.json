{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Warm Kale Salad With Walnuts and Pomegranate", "description": "Pomegranate molasses makes a sweet-tart contribution to this salad of cooked, not raw, kale. It\u2019s really more of a vegetable side dish, but could very well be a salad course on its own. In every bite there\u2019s a morsel of warm kale, walnut and pomegranate. Truth be told, it is just as tasty served at room temperature. It\u2019s also great to make ahead of time: You can cook the kale, toast the nuts and make the vinaigrette early. Then toss everything and garnish five minutes before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/09/dining/02tanisrex3-salad/merlin_215517735_ca7df0c0-d96b-47ad-9d7a-a8e08a13d70a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "quick, weeknight, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "green salad, kale, pomegranate molasses, walnut, thanksgiving, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 101}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and pepper", "2 pounds kale, stems removed", "2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses", "2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar, white-wine vinegar or sherry vinegar", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup toasted walnuts", "1/2 cup pomegranate seeds, or more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
