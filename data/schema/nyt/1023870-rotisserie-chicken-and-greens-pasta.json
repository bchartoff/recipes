{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Rotisserie Chicken and Greens Pasta", "description": "Rotisserie chicken, with its browned, crisp skin and juicy meat, provides a great leg up when there\u2019s no time to roast one yourself. Add some pre-cut greens and it becomes the base for this rich, nourishing pasta sauce, which comes together while the noodles cook. Although convenient, rotisserie chicken meat can be underseasoned, so this recipe calls for seasoning it more. Look for baby cooking greens or chopped greens, like kale, spinach, chard or escarole, which will melt easily into the jammy onions and garlic. Fresh lemon juice rounds out this pasta, making it bright; cream is optional but highly endorsed. A sprinkle of Parmesan finishes this dish with even more depth and umami.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Christian Reynoso"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/25/multimedia/cr-rotisserie-chicken-and-greens-pasta-lvbp/cr-rotisserie-chicken-and-greens-pasta-lvbp-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "chard, chicken, kale, penne, rigatoni, spinach, ziti", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 306}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 pound rigatoni, penne rigate, penne or ziti", "1 small rotisserie chicken (about 1 3/4 pounds) or about 2 1/2 cups shredded cooked chicken", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced (about 2 packed cups)", "5 large garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 cup chicken stock (see Tip)", "1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)", "8 to 10 ounces baby kale or spinach, or chopped chard or other cooking greens", "1 juicy lemon, zested then halved", "Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
