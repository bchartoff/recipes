{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Spicy Sausage, Broccoli Rabe and Chickpeas", "description": "In this hearty weeknight pasta recipe, chickpeas contribute an earthy, nutty flavor to the classic combination of sausage and broccoli rabe. The addition of Parmesan, butter, and lemon juice just before serving balances the heat from the sausage with a bit of richness, creating a bright and flavorful sauce in the process. This pasta is incredibly versatile: You can use any sturdy greens or even broccoli in place of the broccoli rabe, and feel free to swap in whatever pasta shape and canned beans you have on hand. You can even substitute sweet Italian sausage or ground pork or turkey for the sausage in a pinch; add about 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes to give this dish its spicy kick.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/25/dining/lh-skillet-pasta/merlin_170015745_a6c44a49-00d8-46ab-9a3c-f93194816f34-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, beans, meat, pastas, vegetables", "keywords": "broccoli rabe, chickpea, italian sausage, pasta, white wine, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 pounds broccoli rabe or broccoli, chopped, tough stems discarded, or hearty greens like kale or escarole", "1 pound shaped pasta, such as campanelle or orecchiette", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 pound hot Italian sausage, casings removed, or sweet Italian sausage, ground pork or turkey", "3 garlic cloves, minced (about 1 tablespoon)", "1/2 cup dry white wine or chicken stock", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas or other white beans, rinsed and drained", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino, plus more for serving", "1 lemon, zested and juiced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
