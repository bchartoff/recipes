{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Lemony Chicken With Brussels Sprouts", "description": "This is a true oven-to-table sheet-pan dinner full of tender, crunchy brussels sprouts and crispy, lemony chicken. A simple lemon-and-herb compound butter seasons both the chicken and sprouts, which are then topped with thin lemon slices that become crunchy in the oven, offering a nice textural element and a bright splash of color and flavor. The key is to cut the lemon rounds almost paper-thin, so they can crisp up and lose their bitterness. This recipe is easily adjustable for a larger batch: Add 4 drumsticks (about 1 \u00bd pounds) to the chicken thighs, increase the butter by 1 tablespoon and adjust seasonings as needed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yasmin Fahr"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/02/dining/yf-lemony-roasted-chicken-thighs-and-brussels/yf-lemony-roasted-chicken-thighs-and-brussels-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, weekday, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, chicken thigh, lemon, roast chicken, sheet-pan, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3293}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee, at room temperature", "2 lemons, both zested (about 2 tablespoons), 1 cut into very thin rounds and 1 halved, seeds removed", "1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems, finely chopped", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil", "4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds)", "1 1/2 pounds brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved, tough outer leaves removed", "1 small red onion, peeled, quartered and cut into 1-inch wedges", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees, set one rack 6 inches from the broiler and place another rack in the lower third of the oven.
