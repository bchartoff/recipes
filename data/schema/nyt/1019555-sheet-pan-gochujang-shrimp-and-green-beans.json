{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Gochujang Shrimp and Green Beans", "description": "Say hello to your broiler, that super-intense direct heat source in your oven that, like a grill, crisps food fast. (It\u2019s either in the top of your oven or in the pull-out drawer below.) While it heats, toss shrimp and green beans in a fiery sauce of gochujang (a Korean fermented chile paste), soy sauce and honey, then broil for mere minutes. Just five minutes! The shrimp and green beans emerge with blistered outsides and snappy insides, reminiscent of Sichuan dry-fried green beans, while the sauce and the caramelized char make quick work of building deep, addictive flavors. Serve with rice, noodles or lettuce leaves. To make it vegetarian, swap shrimp for quick-cooking vegetables, edamame or well-drained tofu.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/13/dining/as-gochujang-shrimp-and-green-beans-horizontal/merlin_143375058_f63d0f5c-aa5f-424c-b3db-ce68f54d12c7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, weekday, seafood", "keywords": "gochujang, honey, shrimp, soy sauce, string beans, low-carb, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 725}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 211, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "1296 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons gochujang", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "2 teaspoons honey", "1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined", "1 pound green beans, trimmed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place an oven rack as close to the broiler as possible.
