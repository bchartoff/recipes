{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Orzo with Summer Squash and Pesto", "description": "There\u2019s still plenty of summer squash in the market. I like to dice it small for this dish, cook it with a little garlic and marjoram or mint and toss it with orzo, a  pasta that looks like rice but tastes and feels like pasta. I love the textures of the two, and the pesto completes the dish. Make sure to dice the squash small so  the pieces aren\u2019t much bigger than the grains of orzo.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/09/science/09recipehealthorzo/09recipehealthorzo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4 to 5", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, summer, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 222}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "500 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 garlic clove, minced", "1 1/2 pounds zucchini or other summer squash, cut in 1/4-inch dice (about 4 cups)", "2 teaspoons chopped fresh marjoram or mint", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "10 ounces (1 1/3 cups) orzo", "1/3 cup basil or basil-mint pesto (1/2 batch)", "Additional grated Parmesan or pecorino for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the orzo and salt generously.
