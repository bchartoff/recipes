These are simple buttermilk/buckwheat blini with pur\u00e9ed butternut squash and sage whisked into the batter. I make them small and serve them as hors d\u2019oeuvres. For vegetarian blini I top them with drained yogurt and a small spoonful of the saut\u00e9ed winter squash with anchovies, capers and olives in this week\u2019s recipes. You can also go the more traditional blini route and top with smoked salmon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/02/science/04recipehealth/04recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "50 to 60 blini, depending on the size.", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 11}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 30, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "52 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound butternut squash, seeded, membranes removed", "1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) whole-wheat flour", "1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) buckwheat flour", "1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "2 eggs", "1 1/2 cups buttermilk", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or a combination of olive oil and canola oil", "1 tablespoon slivered sage leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
