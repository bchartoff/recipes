They\u2019re all tossed together with loads of garlicky, anchovy-imbued breadcrumbs and a hit of fresh basil or parsley. Serve it with a big salad of crisp lettuces for crunch. It\u2019s a dish that\u2019s good hot, warm or at room temperature, so you can make this recipe a little ahead of time if that works best for your kitchen flow.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/28/dining/23Apperex/merlin_211047606_d44cbb01-99b3-48de-bd97-8b4138b285ef-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas, main course", "keywords": "anchovy, eggplant, garlic, pasta, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 121}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes (about 8 cups)", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 pound short pasta, such as shells or orecchiette", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling and as needed", "12 anchovies, coarsely chopped", "8 garlic cloves, 3 grated or finely minced, 5 thinly sliced", "1 cup coarse dry bread crumbs, either panko or homemade", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered if large", "2 tablespoons capers, drained", "1 cup torn fresh basil or parsley", "1 lemon, zested and halved"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place eggplant in a bowl and sprinkle all over with salt; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a pot of well-salted water, cook pasta according to the package directions until about 1 minute shy of al dente.
