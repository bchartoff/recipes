{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Scallop Tartare", "description": "Sweet and tender scallops make a natural substitute for raw beef in tartare. While beef stands up to strong, aggressive capers and mustard, the ratios are dialed back here to accommodate the scallop, which is more subtle. Because they\u2019re being served raw, it\u2019s important to buy fresh, high-quality scallops. Many store-bought options are soaked in a phosphate solution that plumps them up with water (therefore bumping up the price), so it\u2019s important to look for scallops that are labeled \u201cdry\u201d or \u201cdry-packed\u201d for more pure flavor.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/09/dining/Scallop-Tartare/Scallop-Tartare-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, finger foods, seafood", "keywords": "appetizer, eggs, parsley, scallops, toast, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": null, "recipeIngredient": ["8 large scallops", "2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped", "1/4 cup minced fresh parsley", "2 tablespoons minced red onion", "2 tablespoons capers", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "Salt and pepper", "Worcestershire sauce", "Toast points, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Chop the scallops into small pieces then transfer to a medium bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the eggs, parsley, red onion, capers and mustard, and gently toss to coat.
