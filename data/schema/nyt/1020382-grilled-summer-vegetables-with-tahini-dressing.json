Take care to keep the fire medium-hot, so you can cook the vegetables without letting them become scorched or blackened. A bit of char is nice, of course, but don\u2019t try for perfect grill marks. Remove vegetables from the grill when they are just done. They\u2019re topped with a garlicky, lemony tahini dressing that serves as a perfect accompaniment.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/14/dining/09Kitch-rex-vegetables1/merlin_158756298_c6995819-97c6-4b86-bfc2-c20d2ea80c09-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "eggplant, red pepper, tahini, tomatoes, zucchini, main course, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 439}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup tahini, at room temperature and well stirred", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "Pinch of ground cayenne", "2 garlic cloves, grated or pounded to a paste", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup plain yogurt (not Greek-style yogurt)", "Kosher salt", "2 medium red onions, peeled", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 ripe red bell peppers or other peppers, such as Corno di Toro", "2 pounds zucchini, yellow summer squash, pattypans or a combination", "2 medium eggplants (or 4 small Japanese eggplants)", "4 small tomatoes", "Paprika or piment\u00f3n, for garnish (optional)", "Chopped mint, dill, parsley and cilantro, for garnish", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the tahini dressing: Put tahini, lemon juice, cayenne and garlic in a small mixing bowl, and whisk until smooth.
