{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jimbo and Ginga", "description": "The lowly Mexican bulldog (a frozen margarita with an upturned bottle of beer in it) was the inspiration for this quirky variation on a whiskey and ginger highball. As with many of the bulldog variations created by Eben Freeman at Genuine Liquorette, a bar in Little Italy, the booze comes from a 50-milliliter mini-bottle and the mixer from the short can the bottle is emptied into. Don\u2019t expect a lot of finesse from this drink; it is a highball, after all. But expect a little more fun than usual. If you can\u2019t find a mini of Jim Beam, another light whiskey like Jameson will do.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/07/dining/07BULLDOGREX/07BULLDOG1-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bourbon, ginger ale", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 33}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 8-ounce can of ginger ale", "1/4 ounce fresh lemon juice", "Angostura bitters", "1 50-milliliter bottle of Jim Beam bourbon", "Lemon wedge, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Open the can of ginger ale and use a citrus reamer to widen the hole.
