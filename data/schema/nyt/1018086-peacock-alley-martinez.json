The pre-Prohibition drink\u2019s flavor is rendered more complex by his using both sweet and dry vermouth (making this a \u201cperfect\u201d Martinez), as well as the addition of orange bitters. At the Waldorf, Mr. Caiafa barrel-ages his own gin. But for the home bartender, the Ransom or Greenhook commercial brands will do nicely. Like many of the drinks on the Peacock Alley list, it\u2019s an elegantly modernized version of a classic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/04/dining/04WALDORF3/04WALDORF3-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "bitters, gin, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 37}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 216, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "4 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces Old Tom gin, preferably Ransom or Greenhook Ginsmiths", "1 ounce sweet vermouth, preferably Martini & Rossi", "3/4 ounce Noilly Prat extra-dry vermouth", "1/4 ounce maraschino liqueur, preferably Luxardo", "1 dash Angostura bitters", "1 dash orange bitters, preferably Regans\u2019", "Lemon twist, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass three-quarters filled with ice.
