{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Miso Chicken Ramen With Bok Choy", "description": "<p><span>The pressure cooker brings this deeply flavored ramen within reach on a busy weeknight. The trick is to infuse the broth with as much flavor as possible using two powerful ingredients: miso and dried shiitake mushrooms. Use the best chicken broth you can get your hands on. Unsalted homemade broth is ideal, but a good, low-sodium store-bought chicken broth or bouillon works very well too. (Standard store-bought broth will make the soup too salty.) Water can also be a good base, but if you use it, be sure to use bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs to give the soup some body. For a bonus boost of umami, drop a piece of dried kombu seaweed into the soup when you add the bok choy, and remove it before serving.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><em>Find the slow-cooker version of the recipe <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019694-slow-cooker-chicken-ramen-with-bok-choy-and-miso\">here</a>.</em></p>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/28/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-miso-chicken-ramen/merlin_146005716_c798bd4d-4c29-417d-93da-510cfcdf3e72-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 or 5 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, soups and stews", "keywords": "bok choy, chicken, mirin, miso, shiitake, soy sauce, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 237}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 837, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "77 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "3225 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 3\u00bd pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs or 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1/2 heaping cup sweet white or yellow miso, plus more to taste", "2 scallions, trimmed and halved, plus more for serving", "4 dried shiitake mushrooms, halved (optional)", "3 garlic cloves, smashed", "6 cups low-sodium chicken broth or water", "1 pound baby bok choy, cored and roughly chopped", "2 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons mirin, plus more to taste", "12 to 16 ounces fresh or dried ramen, cooked and drained", "Soft-boiled eggs, sesame seeds and toasted nori sheets, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the chicken thighs in a 6- to 8-quart pressure cooker and crumble the miso on top.
