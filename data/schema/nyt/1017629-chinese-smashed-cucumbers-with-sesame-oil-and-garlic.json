Versions of this salad, pai huang gua, are served all over the country, sometimes spiked with dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns for more dimensions of flavor. In Beijing, people buy whole chilled cucumbers from street vendors and munch them on the go, much as Americans become attached to their cups of iced coffee in summer. The smashing process, a classic Chinese technique, cracks the skin, helps release the seeds and splits the flesh into appealing craggy pieces. Salting and chilling the cracked cucumbers give them the perfect cool, crunchy, watery mouth feel.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/19/dining/19CUKE1/19CUKE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian, chinese", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "cucumber, grapeseed oil, sesame oil, white sesame seed, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1328}, "recipeIngredient": ["About 2 pounds thin-skinned cucumbers like English or Persian (8 to 10 mini cucumbers, 4 medium-size or 2 large greenhouse)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for cucumbers", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar, plus more for cucumbers", "1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar", "2 teaspoons sesame oil", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon grapeseed or extra-virgin olive oil", "2 large garlic cloves, minced or put through a press", "Red pepper flakes, to taste", "Small handful whole cilantro leaves, for garnish", "2 teaspoons toasted white sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse cucumbers and pat dry.
