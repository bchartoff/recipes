{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Smashed Roasted Carrots", "description": "This wintry salad, inspired by Asian smashed cucumbers, stars sweet roasted carrots. After being roasted until just tender, the carrots are lightly flattened to create texture on their surface, then broiled to char their edges. The gingery, garlicky dressing is a bracing contrast to the sweetness of the carrots. You can use either black vinegar or rice wine vinegar here. Although their flavors are completely different \u2014 the black vinegar is caramelized and rich, the rice vinegar lighter and fresher \u2014 they each harmonize with the other ingredients in the dressing. Serve this salad warm or at room temperature: It holds up well if you want to make it a few hours in advance. This salad will also work with parsnips.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/25/multimedia/18apperex1-carrots-ktqg/18apperex1-carrots-ktqg-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "carrot, chile crisp, chile oil, cilantro, peanut, rice vinegar, salad, sesame oil, soy sauce, vegan, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 79}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds carrots, trimmed and scrubbed, large carrots sliced lengthwise into approximately 1-inch-thick pieces", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or safflower, or peanut oil", "2 teaspoons fine salt, plus more as needed", "2 tablespoons black vinegar or rice vinegar, plus more to taste", "1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil", "2 teaspoons dark brown sugar, plus more to taste", "2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced", "3/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish if desired", "2/3 cup coarsely chopped roasted peanuts, for garnish", "Chile oil or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022366-chile-crisp\">chile crisp</a>, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
