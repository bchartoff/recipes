{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Swordfish au Poivre", "description": "Au poivre, the peppery French finish for a steak, is simpler and more versatile than its fancy-sounding name suggests. A quick pan sauce of cream and Cognac enrobes a seared piece of meat fueled with crushed black or green peppercorns. But the preparation doesn\u2019t have to be just for meat. At Veronika, a new restaurant in Manhattan that was attracting pre-pandemic attention, the English chef Robert Aikens used the seasoning and sauce to finish a thick fist of tender celeriac, with excellent results. Boneless chicken breasts are another choice. Here I opted for swordfish steaks, though you could use another densely textured slab of fish, like halibut, instead. But producing au poivre is strictly \u00e0 la minute: Have your ingredients ready to apply so the wait time for serving is minimal.\u00a0The recipe is easily reduced to serve two for that date-night dinner while sequestered at home with a good bottle of Burgundy to share.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/17/dining/11pairrex/merlin_173165397_d0d4e7ba-789e-4bc7-ae1c-e8b484ded440-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "seafood, main course", "keywords": "cognac, shallot, swordfish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 130}, "recipeIngredient": ["24 ounces swordfish about 1-inch thick, skin removed, in 4 portions", "Fine sea salt", "1 1/2 tablespoons crushed black peppercorns", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "1 large shallot, minced", "1/2 cup Cognac or brandy", "2/3 cup heavy cream", "1 tablespoon minced flat-leaf parsley leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 150 degrees.
