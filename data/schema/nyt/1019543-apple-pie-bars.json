{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apple Pie Bars", "description": "This delivers all the pleasure of apple pie \u2014 a buttery crust and topping sandwiching juicy spiced apples \u2014 without the need to roll out a dough. A simple dough is pressed into a bottom crust and squeezed into crumbles for the top. You can arrange the topping into a lattice, stripes, or other decorative pattern if you\u2019d like. The whole pan easily serves 24 and can be cut into smaller bars if you want to serve an even-bigger crowd. These bars are best the day they are made, but they can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Or, they can be frozen immediately after cooling and kept in the freezer for up to 1 month. Just make sure to thaw them before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/04/dining/apple-pie-bars/apple-pie-bars-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "2 dozen bars", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, cookies and bars", "keywords": "apple, cardamom, nutmeg, walnut, dessert, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 771}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 298, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "100 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Softened butter, for greasing pan", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/200 grams sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "3 sticks/340 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes", "3/4 cup/75 grams walnuts, toasted and chopped", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 1/2 pounds/680 grams tart apples, such as Granny Smith (about 3 large), peeled, cored and cut into 1/8-inch slices", "1 1/2 pounds/680 grams sweet-tart apples, such as Fuji, Pink Lady or Gala (about 3 large), peeled, cored and cut into 1/8-inch slices", "3 tablespoons lemon juice", "1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom", "2/3 cup/135 grams sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the crust and topping: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
