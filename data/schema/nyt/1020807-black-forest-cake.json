{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Black Forest Cake", "description": "Black forest cake, which originated in the Black Forest region of Germany, is typically made with a light chocolate sponge cake, soaked with cherry syrup and cherry brandy (Kirsch), then layered with whipped cream and cherries. This version swaps the chocolate sponge for a denser, fudgier chocolate cake to delicious effect. But slicing a rich chocolate cake into four thin layers can be a bit tricky. To make the job a little easier, cool them completely before slicing. The cherry jam and syrup can be made in advance.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/15/dining/ss-black-forest-cake/merlin_165684495_6689b1a0-42b5-4228-b871-37bb983d797e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, german", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "cherries, chocolate, heavy cream, kirsch, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 132}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/240 milliliters vegetable oil, plus more for greasing the pans", "1 1/2 cups/140 grams Dutch-process cocoa powder", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters boiling water", "1 cup/240 milliliters buttermilk", "4 large eggs", "1 1/2 cups/330 grams packed dark brown sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "4 cups (about 20 ounces/600 grams) fresh or frozen dark sweet cherries, pitted", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon cornstarch", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "1 to 2 tablespoons Kirsch", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "4 cups/960 milliliters heavy cream", "6 ounces/170 grams bittersweet chocolate, shaved into curls", "8 fresh or frozen whole dark sweet cherries, pitted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
