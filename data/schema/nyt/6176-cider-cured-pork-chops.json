{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cider-Cured Pork Chops", "description": "This is a home cook's take on a restaurant special, with shortcuts baked into the recipe. I learned the original at the elbow of Marc Murphy, the chef and an owner of Landmarc in Manhattan, and then adapted it for use in the home kitchen. (He grills. I pan-roast.) Brining gives the pork an incredible flavor, one amplified by the accompanying caramelized onions and apples. A drizzle of mock Bordelaise over the top elevates the whole enterprise: it's a meal for date nights and celebrations.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/22/dining/Cider-Cured-Pork-Chops-copy/Cider-Cured-Pork-Chops-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P3DT45M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "apple cider, pork chops, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 155}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 539, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "884 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning chops", "2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning chops", "4 cups apple cider, plus more as needed", "6 1 1/2-inch-thick center-cut or loin-cut pork chops, bone in", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To make the brine, dissolve the salt in 1/2 gallon of warm water in a large bowl.
