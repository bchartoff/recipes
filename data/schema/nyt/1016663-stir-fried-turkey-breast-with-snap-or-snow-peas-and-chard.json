{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stir-Fried Turkey Breast With Snap or Snow Peas and Chard", "description": "Turkey cutlets are easy to prep and cook quickly, and young snap peas can be almost as tender as the more traditional snow peas for stir-fries. Shopping for ingredients for this week\u2019s recipes in my farmers\u2019 market, I found young, tender snap peas that were almost as delicate as snow peas. I had part of a bunch of Swiss chard and used both vegetables. I like using turkey breast cutlets in stir-fries; they\u2019ve already been cut to a uniform thickness, so all you need to do is slice them across the grain to get even pieces that cook in minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/16/science/16recipehealth/16recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, high fiber, high protein, kosher, main course, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 3, "ratingCount": 39}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 311, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "749 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound turkey cutlets, cut across the grain in thin (1/4 to 1/2-inch) slices", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 to 2 tablespoons soy sauce (to taste)", "1 tablespoon Chinese cooking sherry (Shaoxing rice wine) or dry sherry", "1/4 cup vegetable stock or water", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon sugar (to taste)", "1 teaspoon cornstarch or arrowroot dissolved in 1/2 cup vegetable stock, chicken stock or water", "2 tablespoons peanut, canola, sunflower, or grape seed oil", "1 tablespoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "3/4 pound sugar snap peas or snow peas, strings and stems removed", "1 bunch scallions, white and green parts separated, minced", "1/2 pound Swiss chard, stemmed, leaves washed in 2 changes of water and chopped (about 3 cups), stems diced", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season sliced turkey cutlets with salt and pepper.
