{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Burrata With Romano Beans and Roasted Eggplant", "description": "Although burrata is inarguably the star of this stunning summery salad, roasted eggplant, cherry tomatoes and Romano beans add a brilliant mix of colors, textures and flavors to the creamy mozzarella. The eggplant is soft and rich; the tomatoes, juicy and sweet; and the Romano beans, which look like flat, broad green beans, add a nice crunch. Then, to season it all, the vegetables are tossed with a piquant mix of garlic oil, capers, olives and fresh herbs. Serve this as a light meal or a first course, with grilled or toasted country bread, perhaps smeared with a little of the garlic confit left over from making the garlic oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/18/multimedia/clark-romano-beans/clark-romano-beans-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, basil, burrata, eggplant, kalamata olives, mint, romano beans, tomato, summer, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 237}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 681, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "25 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "57 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "1090 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds eggplant, diced in 1-inch pieces", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed for cooking beans", "8 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "6 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved (about 1 1/2 cups)", "1 pound Romano beans, trimmed", "1/4 cup pitted and sliced kalamata olives", "1 tablespoon capers, drained", "1/4 cup torn fresh mint", "1/4 cup torn fresh basil", "2 teaspoons red wine vinegar, more as needed", "Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, as needed", "Black pepper, as needed", "12 ounces burrata", "Crusty bread, toasted or grilled, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put eggplant in a colander.
