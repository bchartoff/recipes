{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Parmesan Chicken Breast With Tomato and Herb Salad", "description": "For better weeknight chicken, dredge it in flour loaded with freshly grated Parmesan and shallow-fry it. The cheese works to create a sort of frico, so you don\u2019t need bread crumbs for a deeply flavorful crust. While you could make this entirely on the stovetop, you risk overcooking the Parmesan, and under- or overcooking the meat. Instead, finish it in the oven, which yields a juicy, tender breast and keeps the Parmesan from getting too dark. Serve with perfectly ripe beefsteak and cherry tomatoes, jumbled together with salt and herbs and a splash of vinegar to make the tomatoes pop.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/dining/sc-parm-chicken/sc-parm-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry", "keywords": "chicken breast, parmesan, tomato, fall, summer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 170}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 755, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "60 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1216 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds ripe beefsteak or heirloom tomatoes, cut into wedges (or halved if small)", "1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved", "1 tablespoon sherry or cider vinegar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus for seasoning", "1/4 teaspoon black\u00a0pepper, plus more for seasoning", "6 ounces Parmesan", "1 cup flour", "2 large eggs, well beaten", "4 skinless, boneless chicken breast,\u00a0halved (about 1/2-inch thick)", "3 tablespoons canola or grapeseed oil\u00a0", "2 tablespoons thinly sliced basil", "1/4 cup finely chopped parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Toss together tomatoes, vinegar, salt and pepper in a bowl, and set aside.
