The secret: use a jellyroll pan, which means that there is a greater amount of kugel surface area to brown in the oven, and bake it at a slightly higher temperature. Soaking the raisins in sherry or orange juice adds flavor, and also keeps them from burning in the extra-hot oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/15/dining/kugel-still/kugel-still-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, casseroles, noodles", "keywords": "fall, main course, side dish, raisins", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 245}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 446, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "54 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "18 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "18 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "326 milligrams", "sugarContent": "19 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup raisins", "Sherry or orange juice", "1 pound egg noodles", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, more for pan", "4 large eggs", "3 cups cottage cheese", "1 cup sour cream", "1/3 cup sugar", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "Grated zest of 1 lemon", "Pinch of salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put raisins in a microwave-safe bowl or small saucepan and cover with sherry or orange juice.
