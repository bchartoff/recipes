{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Creamy Kale With Fontina and Bread Crumbs", "description": "This recipe, made in a slow cooker or on the stovetop, is a rich, satisfying way to eat hearty winter greens, a dish especially suited to a holiday table. Crunchy, lemony panko lends a crucial counterpoint to the creamy braised kale. Use any variety of kale you like, though collards or mustard greens would also work well. Fontina melts beautifully and is a flavorful but relatively mild cheese, making it ideal here. The cream cheese adds tang while stabilizing the fontina and keeping it creamy even as it sits on the table for a long meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/dining/sg-kale/sg-kale-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "bread crumbs, cream cheese, fontina, kale, fall, winter, side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 227}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 545, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "538 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 to 3\u00bd pounds kale (3 to 5 large bunches), stemmed and leaves roughly chopped or torn into bite-size pieces", "3/4 cup olive oil", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, preferably aged", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 cup panko-style bread crumbs", "Black pepper, for seasoning", "Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon", "8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature", "8 ounces fontina, grated (about 2 heaping cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "Slow Cooker Method", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the kale to a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker in 3 batches: Season each batch with about a third of the olive oil, salt and vinegar, and vigorously massage into the kale with your hands.
