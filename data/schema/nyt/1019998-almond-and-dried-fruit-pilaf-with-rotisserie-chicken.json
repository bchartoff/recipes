It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nHere's a free-form rice pilaf, made with onions, dried fruit and slivered almonds. First, melt a knob of butter in a pot, then saut\u00e9 a sliced onion in it until translucent. Add rice, as much as you want to cook, and stir it around, then add water in its usual ratio to the rice, and cook as you always do. At the end, add some chopped prunes, or currants, or raisins, or all three, along with a handful of slivered almonds and salt and pepper. Fluff the rice to mix everything together. Put the top back on the pot, and let the rice and mix-ins mellow out for a few minutes. Serve alongside a store-bought roast chicken, the legs and thighs separated and the breasts cut on the bias and fanned out for show.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17NORECIPE-CHICKEN-ALMOND-PILAF/merlin_147763692_86c4264f-5843-4a9a-8631-13006b108148-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, grains and rice, poultry", "keywords": "almonds, currants, prune, raisins, rotisserie chicken, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 76}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019998-almond-and-dried-fruit-pilaf-with-rotisserie-chicken"}
