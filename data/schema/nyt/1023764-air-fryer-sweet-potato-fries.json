While sweet potato fries won\u2019t crisp up as much as their potato counterparts, that\u2019s part of the appeal, offering textural contrast of creamy centers and charred tips. Oomph from any of your favorite spices would work well here, along with the paprika. Sumac could add a punch of brightness or a dash of cayenne can impart some heat.\u00a0 If your air fryer basket is larger, try a bigger sweet potato for a higher serving \u2014 but don\u2019t overfill it with sweet potatoes, or they\u2019ll steam rather than crisping in spots.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eleanore Park"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/22/multimedia/ep-air-fryer-sweet-potato-fries-1-b3a8/ep-air-fryer-sweet-potato-fries-1-b3a8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "1 to 2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for one, for two, lunch, quick, snack, weeknight, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "air fryer, paprika, sweet potato, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 128}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small sweet potato (about 8 ounces), peeled", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 teaspoons ground paprika", "Salt", "Ketchup or mustard (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat air fryer to 400 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut the sweet potato in half lengthwise then set each half on its flat surface and slice into \u00bc-inch planks.
