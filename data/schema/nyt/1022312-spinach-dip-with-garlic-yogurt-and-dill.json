{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach Dip With Garlic, Yogurt and Dill", "description": "Lemony, garlic-laden and full of chopped herbs and Greek yogurt, this ultra-creamy spinach dip is a fresher, tangier take on the retro kind made with dehydrated soup mix. It\u2019s best to take the cream cheese out of the fridge at least an hour ahead so it can soften; otherwise you can heat it in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up. Firm, cold cream cheese won\u2019t mix into the dip as easily. Serve this with any combination of cut-up vegetables, crackers, toast and sturdy chips.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/23/dining/18apperex/merlin_189026475_f3da89a0-933e-4338-a5c9-adc333f99cf6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "cream cheese, scallion, spinach, yogurt, fourth of july, labor day, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 723}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 ounces fresh baby spinach, or 1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed", "3/4 cup sliced scallions, whites and greens (from about 1 bunch)", "1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt, preferably whole milk", "1/2 cup cream cheese, softened", "1/2 cup chopped dill", "2 tablespoons chopped parsley", "2 fat garlic cloves, finely grated, passed through a press or minced", "2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "3/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to garnish", "Urfa or Aleppo pepper flakes, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using fresh spinach, put it in a colander in the sink.
