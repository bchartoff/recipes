{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Coconut Tempeh", "description": "This plant-based spin on <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020717-coconut-shrimp\">coconut shrimp</a> uses crumbled tempeh instead of shrimp. A mixture of coconut milk, sambal oelek, cornstarch and honey (substitute agave nectar to make it vegan) helps shredded coconut and panko stick to the tempeh, then the little nuggets fry up light, crispy and coconut-y through and through. A dusting of lime salt gives these a little spark (like the salted rim on a cocktail), and of course there\u2019s a dipping sauce. Coconut shrimp is typically served with sweet chile sauce, but here, just use more of the sweet, spicy coconut milk. To make these tempeh nuggets a meal, serve with grains, saut\u00e9ed greens like kale or spinach, or rice noodles.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/11/dining/as-crispy-coconut-tempeh/merlin_195006840_eed79e6c-7c68-43e4-808a-53e3eef56baf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "coconut, coconut milk, tempeh, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 296}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "Kosher salt", "1 teaspoon lime zest (from 1 lime)", "1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "2 tablespoons sambal oelek or Sriracha", "1 tablespoon honey or agave nectar", "1/2 cup cornstarch", "2 teaspoons lime juice (from 1 lime)", "Neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed (about 1 cup), plus more as needed", "2 (8-ounce) packages tempeh, crumbled into \u00bd- to 1-inch pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, stir together the shredded coconut and the panko.
