Yet it\u2019s little more than onions (lots of them) and beef, simmered until both fall apart.\n\nBoiling the onions before cooking is a variation on traditional technique and could be considered a shortcut; it does save time, though not a whole lot of it. It's easy enough, and more traditional, to slice the onions raw and increase cooking time accordingly.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/13/dining/13COOKING-PASTA-GENOVESE1/13COOKING-PASTA-GENOVESE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "pastas", "keywords": "beef, pasta, red onion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 734}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 628, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "40 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "1110 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 1/4 pounds red onions", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 celery rib, trimmed and roughly chopped", "1/4 pound bacon or pancetta, chopped", "2 1/4 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup dry white wine, plus more if desired", "1 pound dried pasta, like ziti, tortiglioni or rigatoni", "Finely grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
