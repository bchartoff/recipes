{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Herby Three-Bean Salad", "description": "Ready for picnics and potlucks, this zippy take on a classically American three-bean salad\u00a0features crunchy green beans, creamy chickpeas and cannellini beans (and is vegan, too). The marinated vegetables (fennel, celery and onions) add texture and a vinegary kick, while a mix of herbs lend complexity and freshness. Feel free to use whatever combination of canned beans you like; kidney beans are classic, black beans velvety, black-eyed peas earthy. You can prepare this salad up to four hours ahead and keep it at room temperature, or you can make it the day before and refrigerate it. Toss well and add more salt and vinegar, if needed, just before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/30/dining/25apperex/merlin_189647289_78b665f3-f7ee-4056-9d01-3a72d998c4f6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "quick, salads and dressings, side dish", "keywords": "cannellini beans, chickpea, fennel, green beans, fourth of july, labor day, tailgate, spring, summer, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 976}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds", "1 1/4 teaspoons salt, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup unsweetened rice vinegar, plus more to taste", "2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme leaves", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste", "1 cup thinly sliced red onion", "1 cup thinly sliced fennel, celery or a combination", "8 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 1/2 cups)", "1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed", "1 (15-ounce) can cannellini or Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed", "3/4 cup chopped fresh soft herbs, such as parsley, mint, dill, cilantro or a combination", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a dry medium saucepan (one large enough to hold the green beans in Step 4),\u00a0toast coriander seeds over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 2 minutes.
