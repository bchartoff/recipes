{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Forbidden Rice Pudding With Blueberries", "description": "This recipe is an adaptation of a wonderful recipe by Sherry Yard, executive pastry chef at Spago Beverly Hills. Forbidden rice, also known as Chinese black rice, is packaged by Lotus Foods and sold at Whole Foods and many gourmet grocers. It becomes purple when cooked, which makes a rice pudding made with Forbidden rice ideal for the addition of blueberries. Serve this for dessert or for breakfast. For a delicious vegan rice pudding, substitute rice beverage for the milk.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/01/26/health/26recipehealth_600/26recipehealth_600-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "Serves six", "recipeCuisine": "asian, chinese", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "blueberries, chinese black rice, dessert, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 79}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 163, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "30 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "126 milligrams", "sugarContent": "17 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup Forbidden rice (Chinese black rice)", "1 cup water", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 cup low-fat milk or rice beverage", "1 cup unsweetened low-fat coconut milk", "1/4 cup mild honey", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup blueberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the rice, water and salt in a saucepan, and bring to a boil.
