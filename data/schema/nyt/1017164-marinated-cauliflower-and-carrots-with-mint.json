{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Marinated Cauliflower and Carrots With Mint", "description": "This is an elaboration of one of my favorite carrot dishes. That dish couldn\u2019t be simpler \u2013 steamed carrots tossed with sherry vinegar, olive oil, salt and fresh mint. It is good at room temperature or warm, as a starter or a side dish. I added steamed cauliflower to the mix but made no other changes to the formula. The cauliflower, which always loves a vinegar marinade, is a wonderful addition, very compatible with the carrots and pretty, too. The dish is great for a buffet as it only gets better as it sits. The dish is particularly beautiful if you use different colored carrots.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/31/science/recipehealthmarinated/recipehealthmarinated-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings as a starter or side", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, snack, vegetables", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, spring, summer, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 107}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 75, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "198 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound carrots, peeled, quartered, or if fat, cut into sixths at fat ends, then into 2-inch lengths", "1 pound cauliflower (1 small head, 1/2 to 3/4 of a large head), cut or broken into small florets", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup sherry vinegar or champagne vinegar", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "2 to 4 tablespoons chopped fresh mint (to taste)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place carrots and cauliflower in a steamer above 1 inch of boiling water, cover and steam 5 to 8 minutes, until both vegetables are tender but not too soft.
