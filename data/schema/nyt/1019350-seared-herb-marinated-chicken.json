But anything crunchy and coleslaw-like will fare just as well. The longer you marinate the thighs, the more complex they become; four hours is a bare minimum. If you\u2019d like to use white meat, choose bone-in, skin-on breasts for the juiciest result.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/08/dining/08chicken/08chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thighs, cilantro, fish sauce, scallion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 341}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 640, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "48 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "39 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "1602 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 bunch scallions, chopped", "1/2 bunch cilantro, plus more for garnish", "5 garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded if you like", "1/4 cup fish sauce", "1 1/2 tablespoons honey", "Juice of 2 limes, plus 1 lime for garnish", "3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as sunflower or grapeseed", "2 pounds boneless chicken thighs, preferably with skins attached (ask your butcher)", "Green papaya salad, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place scallions, cilantro, garlic, jalape\u00f1o, fish sauce, honey, lime juice and 2 tablespoons oil in a blender.
