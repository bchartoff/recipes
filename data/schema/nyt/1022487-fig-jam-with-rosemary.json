{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fig Jam With Rosemary", "description": "Ripe figs lend their subtle sweetness to this chunky jam. Lemons add a necessary sparkle, and fresh rosemary balances the tanginess. You can substitute other woodsy herbs, such as thyme, marjoram or oregano, or add spices, such as black pepper, but additional seasonings should complement rather than overpower the figs. This jam involves little preparation but yields tasty results: Use it as a spread for warm toast, to serve alongside salty cheese or as a topping for meat dishes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/30/dining/30PRESERVESREX1-fig-jam/merlin_193667502_93330a8a-10b6-4907-a0cf-8d80845e39d8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "3 to 4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "fall, summer, fig preserves, lemon, rosemary", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 155}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds fresh ripe figs, stemmed and chopped (about 6 cups)", "4 large sprigs fresh rosemary (wrapped and tied in cheesecloth)", "2 cups granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons lemon zest (from about 4 lemons)", "1/4 cup lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons), plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the figs in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed pot.
