{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Roasted Pork Chops With Apple Fritters", "description": "The recipe takes a little planning. You want to brine the pork chops for a day or two before you set out to cook. This gives them a juiciness and depth of flavor you are otherwise unlikely to get from a commercially raised hog. (If you have access to a pig raised on acorns and herbs, feel free to cut corners.) Chef Josh Cohen toasts the spices he uses in his brining liquid before incorporating them. This is very much to the good of the chops and is worth the few extra moments it requires.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/29/magazine/29eat/29eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "P2DT1H", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 78}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup apple cider", "6 tablespoons sugar", "4 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "3 bay leaves", "2 dried chiles de \u00e1rbol", "5 juniper berries", "1 teaspoon caraway seeds", "1 teaspoon mustard seeds", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds", "4 pork chops on the bone, approximately 1 \u00bd inches thick", "Freshly ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "2 shallots peeled and finely diced", "1 teaspoon thyme leaves, chopped", "2 tablespoons brandy", "1 cup heavy cream", "\u00bd cup pork or chicken stock", "2 teaspoons whole grain mustard", "1 teaspoon horseradish, ideally freshly grated", "2 cups apple cider", "1 cinnamon stick", "4 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into \u00bd-inch rounds", "1 whole egg", "\u00bd cup very cold seltzer water", "\u00bd cup rice flour", "\u00bd cup all-purpose flour", "1 cup neutral oil, like canola"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, mix the apple cider \nwith 4 cups of water, the sugar and the \nsalt.
