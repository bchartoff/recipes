It may have come from relatives in Tennessee, as a similar recipe appears as \u201cHallelujah Ham Loaves\u201d in \u201cDinner on the Diner,\u201d a 1983 cookbook from the Junior League of Chattanooga. The warm appetizer has won fans wherever Ms. Owens goes. Her mother\u2019s original formula called for raw onions, but Ms. Owens now saut\u00e9s them. Use good smoked ham, either holiday leftovers or from the deli counter. As the buns bake, the butter pools at the bottom, toasting up the base of these irresistible bite-size sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sara Bonisteel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/01/dining/sb-ham-buns/sb-ham-buns--articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, finger foods, sandwiches, appetizer", "keywords": "bread rolls, butter, ham, mustard, onion, poppy seed, swiss cheese", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 681}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks), at room temperature, plus 1 tablespoon", "1 jumbo sweet onion, such as Vidalia, finely chopped (3 cups)", "4 flats of party rolls (see Tip)", "3 tablespoons yellow mustard", "3 tablespoons poppy seeds", "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce", "6 ounces Swiss cheese, grated (2 cups)", "1 pound smoked ham, finely chopped (3 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position racks in top and bottom thirds of the oven and heat oven to 400 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 8 to 10 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "As the onion cooks, split each flat of rolls in half, running a bread knife parallel to the counter as you slice the still-connected rolls.
