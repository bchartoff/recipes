{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mushroom Risotto With Peas", "description": "If you are ever at a loss for what to make for an impromptu dinner party, especially if there will be vegetarians at the table, consider this luxurious mushroom risotto. I added peas because I wanted to introduce some color, and also because the sweetness of the peas fits right in with the flavors of this dish. But this satisfying, elegant dish is fine without peas, too. You\u2019ll get a vibrant dash of green from the parsley added at the end of cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/02/science/04recipehealth/04recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian, mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "arborio rice, mushroom, peas, white wine, fall, winter, gluten-free, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1220}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 316, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "49 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "8 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "961 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 to 7 cups chicken, vegetable or garlic broth or stock, as needed", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup finely chopped onion, or 2 shallots, minced", "3/4 to 1 pound wild mushrooms, cleaned if necessary and torn or sliced into smaller pieces if thick (small wild mushrooms should be left whole, mushrooms like maitake can just be separated into small pieces)", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves or chopped sage", "1 1/2 cups arborio or carnaroli rice", "1/2 cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc", "1 cup frozen peas, thawed (optional)", "2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or a mixture of Parmesan and Pecorino Romano"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring stock or broth to a simmer in a saucepan, with a ladle nearby.
