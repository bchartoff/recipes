{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Miso Squash Soup", "description": "Soup is an easy first course for a seasonal gathering, especially when it can be prepared \u2014 even frozen \u2014 in advance. This one calls for Kabocha squash, a variety that\u2019s not too sweet, and is dense and rich, though delicata, honeynut, the ubiquitous butternut or an everyday orange pumpkin all work well. Seasoned primarily with miso, this calls for only a pinch of cinnamon to hint at the inevitable pumpkin spice. And instead of presenting this vegan soup as a plated first course in china or pottery bowls or even in hollowed-out mini-pumpkins, you might consider spooning it into small cups or glasses for guests to sip as an hors d\u2019oeuvre before dinner.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/10/dining/04pairingrex/04pairingrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "fall, freezer friendly, kabocha, miso, soup, vegetable stock, thanksgiving, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 464}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds Kabocha or butternut squash (1 large or 2 medium)", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or other vegetable oil", "1 medium yellow onion, sliced thin", "3 garlic cloves, sliced", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon", "1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne, or to taste", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "4 tablespoons red miso (see Tip)", "5 cups vegetable stock", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
