With broth made from the turkey carcass and a pile of leg meat (use the white meat for sandwiches), all that is necessary is a handful of spices and some good basmati rice. If you don\u2019t have leftovers, the recipe here can be prepared with fresh turkey legs. You can make it completely vegetarian if you wish, using roasted squash, potatoes or cauliflower, and adding legumes or green peas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/21/dining/21KITCH_SPAN/21KITCH_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "cashew, rice, turkey, fall, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 200}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 915, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "41 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "57 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1403 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 turkey legs, about 3 1/2 pounds (or 1 1/2 pounds leftover roasted turkey meat, preferably leg and wing)", "Kosher salt", "1/4 cup plain yogurt", "1 tablespoon grated ginger", "1 tablespoon grated garlic", "2 teaspoons garam masala", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne", "2 cups best-quality basmati rice", "6 tablespoons ghee, clarified butter or vegetable oil", "2 large onions, sliced in 1/8 inch half-moons", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "4 cups turkey or chicken broth", "1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns", "6 cloves", "6 cardamom pods", "1 2-inch stick cinnamon", "1/2 cup golden raisins", "1 cup raw cashews", "4 hard-cooked eggs, shelled, optional", "1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems", "Yogurt sauce (<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/12967/Yogurt-Sauce.html'>see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season turkey legs with salt and roast for 45 minutes at 375 degrees.
