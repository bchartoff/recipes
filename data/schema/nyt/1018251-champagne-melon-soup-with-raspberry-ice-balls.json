{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Champagne Melon Soup With Raspberry Ice Balls", "description": "Melon with port is a traditional combination in France, the wine served in half a Cavaillon melon, but I always though it could be improved. The beautiful pastel shades of the melons are lost in the deep red-purple of the wine, and port overwhelms the taste of the fruit. In this recipe, the raspberry ice cubes add color and another flavor dimension to the soup, which is quite intense: they make it taste like a kir royale. I keep raspberry cubes in the freezer for more than just this soup. You can also drop them into a glass of Champagne or a martini.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Michel Richard"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, cantaloupe, champagne, honeydew, mint leaves, raspberries, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 319, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "63 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "94 milligrams", "sugarContent": "54 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups raspberries", "Sugar", "1 ripe honeydew melon", "2 ripe cantaloupes", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste", "12 large mint leaves", "1 1/2 cups Champagne"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a blender, combine raspberries with 4 tablespoons water.
