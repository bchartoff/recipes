{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Popovers", "description": "Popovers begin with essentially the same batter as Yorkshire pudding. Purists will tell you that what makes Yorkshire pudding so great is that it\u2019s cooked in beef drippings. But butter isn\u2019t a bad stand-in, and popovers are pretty easy. You can buy special popover pans, with deeper, narrower cups which force the tops up in a more pronounced fashion, but I wouldn\u2019t bother. Any muffin pan will produce a perfect popover if the butter is hot, the batter is rich and smooth and the baker is patient. But the patience ends when the popovers are done: they must be eaten right away.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/01/dining/popovers-still/popovers-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "12 popovers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy", "keywords": "side dish, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 716}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 104, "unsaturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "103 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 tablespoons melted butter", "2 eggs", "1 cup milk", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme (or 1/2 teaspoon dried), optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
