{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whist Cocktail", "description": "Thad Vogler, an owner of two San Francisco restaurant-bars, is a big believer in simplicity in cocktails, keeping the number of ingredients to a minimum. The Whist, drawn from \u201cThe Savoy Cocktail Book,\u201d which was published in 1930, fits that profile. If the recipe is simple, the rewards are complex, owing to the variegated nuances found in all three liquors. It also shows how a little Calvados can go a long way in terms of flavor. Take this drink toward the end of your evening, as it is potent.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/dining/12BRANDY2/12BRANDY2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "for one", "keywords": "calvados, rum, vermouth", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 32}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 148, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": null, "fiberContent": null, "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": null, "sodiumContent": "2 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 ounces aged (5-year-old) rum", "3/4 ounce sweet vermouth, preferably Dolin", "1/2 ounce Calvados"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Stir all ingredients in a mixing glass three-quarters filled with ice until chilled, about 30 seconds.
