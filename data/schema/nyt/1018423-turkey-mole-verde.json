{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Mole Verde", "description": "A few things may come to mind when thinking of mole: chocolate, long ingredient lists and even longer cooking directions. But mole verde is a bit of an exception. This version comes together in about an hour, combining a pumpkin-and-sesame-seed paste with a sauce built from tomatillos, chard, romaine and jalape\u00f1os. Cooked turkey simmers in sauce just long enough to pick up some of the green flavors. For balance, serve with white rice and corn tortillas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/23/dining/23LEFTOVERS3/23LEFTOVERS3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "chard, jalape\u00f1o, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, tomatillo, turkey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 99}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 462, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "828 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup pumpkin seeds", "1/2 cup sesame seeds", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "2 cups turkey or chicken stock, preferably homemade", "1/4 cup neutral-tasting oil (such as canola or grapeseed)", "1/2 medium yellow onion, peeled and cut into large pieces (about 1 cup)", "2 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 pound tomatillos, husks removed and halved", "4 green chard leaves, stems removed, roughly chopped", "5 romaine leaves, roughly chopped", "3 to 4 jalape\u00f1os, stemmed and cut into large pieces, to taste", "1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems (about 1 large bunch)", "2 teaspoons dried oregano", "4 cups shredded cooked turkey (about 1 pound), light and dark meat separated", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "Steamed white rice, for serving", "Corn tortillas, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
