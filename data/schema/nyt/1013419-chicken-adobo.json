{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Adobo", "description": "It is the national dish of the Philippines, and the subject of intense and delicious debate across its 7,100 islands whether made with chicken, pork or fish. Whichever, the protein is braised in vinegar until pungent and rich, sweet and sour and salty at once, then sometimes crisped at the edges in high heat, and always served with the remaining sauce. Its excellence derives from the balance of its flavors, in the alchemy of the process. Cooking softens the acidity of the vinegar, which then combines with the flavor of the meat to enhance it. Whether consumed in Manila\u2019s heat or on the edge of a New York winter, adobo holds the power to change moods and alter dining habits. It is a difficult dish to cook just once. The recipe that follows derives from one given to The Times in 2011 by Amy Besa, who runs, with her husband, Romy Dorotan, the excellent Purple Yam restaurant in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/07/dining/chicken-adobo/chicken-adobo-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weekday", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2438}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1036, "unsaturatedFatContent": "42 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "78 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "69 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "sodiumContent": "1209 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup coconut milk", "\u00bc cup soy sauce", "1\u00bd cup rice vinegar", "12 garlic cloves, peeled", "3 whole bird\u2019s-eye chilies or other fiery chili", "3 bay leaves", "1\u00bd teaspoons freshly ground black pepper", "3 to 4 pounds chicken thighs"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine all of the marinade ingredients in a large, nonreactive bowl or resealable plastic freezer bag.
