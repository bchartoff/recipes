It is not so different from a traditional French pot au feu, but it is spiced in a traditional Vietnamese manner, fragrant with lemongrass, star anise and cinnamon. When the meat is fork tender, carrots are added to complete the dish. If you wish, include turnips or daikon radish or potatoes. Serve it with rice, rice noodles or a freshly baked baguette.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/dining/23kitchrex1/merlin_149035125_4687a6e2-ed75-45a2-b406-1b93cab6d220-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "beef chuck, chinese five-spice powder, ginger, lemongrass, shallots, star anise, fall, winter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 882}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 460, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "53 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1052 milligrams", "sugarContent": "13 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons Vietnamese fish sauce, such as Red Boat", "1 tablespoon brown sugar", "2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger", "2 teaspoons Chinese 5-spice powder", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "3 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "6 large shallots or 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced", "1 cup chopped tomato, fresh or canned", "2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger (from a 2-inch piece)", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "3 tablespoons finely chopped lemongrass, tender center only", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon annatto powder (optional)", "4 star anise pods", "1 (2-inch) cinnamon stick, or substitute cassia bark", "1 or 2 Serrano or Thai chiles, stem on, split lengthwise", "1 1/2 pounds medium carrots, peeled, cut into 2-inch chunks", "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions", "1 cup cilantro sprigs, for garnish", "1/2 cup mint leaves, for garnish", "1/2 cup small basil leaves, preferably Thai, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the marinade: Stir together fish sauce, sugar, ginger, 5-spice powder and pepper."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put beef in a large bowl, add marinade and massage into meat.
