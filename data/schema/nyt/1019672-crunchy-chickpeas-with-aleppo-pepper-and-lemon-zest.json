{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crunchy Chickpeas With Aleppo Pepper and Lemon Zest", "description": "Zippy lemon zest and mildly spicy Aleppo pepper are tossed together with warm roasted chickpeas for a satisfying snack, which pairs well with everything from a gin and tonic to a cold beer. Tossing the dried, toasted beans in oil after they roast helps gives the pepper and lemon something to adhere to. If you\u2019re not having cocktails, these can be used in a salad in place of croutons or anywhere you want some crunch. If you don't have Aleppo pepper, red-pepper flakes make a fine substitute.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/28/dining/ch-chickpea-aleppo-pepper/ch-chickpea-aleppo-pepper-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "About 1 cup", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "beans", "keywords": "Aleppo pepper, chickpea, lemon zest, appetizer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 41}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 209, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "271 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and patted very dry", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper or red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt", "1 teaspoon lemon zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
