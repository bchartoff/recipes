{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pan Bruschetta Spaghetti", "description": "Spaghetti in the dead of summer, when tomatoes are at peak ripeness and break down quickly to coat any pasta in irresistible flavor, is the best time to eat spaghetti. You won\u2019t need a lot of time to make this, just one big pan (use your largest and deepest) and the resolve not to eat the whole pile of noodles yourself. You'll want a slightly larger cast-iron skillet here \u2014 either a 12-inch version, or a deep 10-inch \u2014 to avoid spillage. Make sure to cover the pasta with a lid or foil so it cooks faster, and to stir from time to time. Since you\u2019re not draining the noodles as you would in a traditional pasta dish, it\u2019s good to know that different noodle shapes, sizes and brands may soak up liquid differently and that some tomatoes may be juicier than others. Simmer as long as needed get the sauce to a consistency that\u2019s just right for you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah Copeland"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/dining/sc-bruschetta-pasta-horizontal/merlin_143416674_482aeeee-4a7a-40c3-aefb-276c9351e706-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, pastas", "keywords": "main course, parmesan, spaghetti, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 414}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 505, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "80 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "19 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "687 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 yellow onion, thinly sliced", "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes, to taste", "1 tablespoon cider vinegar", "12 ounces thin spaghetti or linguine, broken in half", "2 pounds Roma or Campari tomatoes, chopped (about 8 to 12 tomatoes)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper", "2 ounces finely grated Parmesan (about 1/2 cup), plus more for serving", "About 1 cup basil leaves, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a very large, deep cast-iron skillet (or a Dutch oven) over medium-low.
