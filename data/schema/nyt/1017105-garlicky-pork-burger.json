{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Garlicky Pork Burger", "description": "If you are cautious, you can cook a little meat and then taste it. Though there are virtually no reported cases of trichinosis from commercial pork in the United States, few people will sample raw pork \u2014 or lamb, with which the danger is even less. So the thing to do is season the meat, then cook up a spoonful in a skillet, taste and season as necessary.\n\nRemember that the burger is the cousin not only of the steak \u2014 which often takes no seasoning beyond salt and pepper \u2014 but also of the meatloaf and the meatball, both of which are highly seasoned. Think about adding minced garlic in small quantities, chopped onion, herbs (especially parsley), grated Parmesan, minced ginger, the old reliable Worcestershire, hot sauce, good chili powder and so on. It\u2019s hard to go wrong here.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, burgers", "keywords": "main course, pork shoulder", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 476, "unsaturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "36 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "468 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds fatty pork shoulder, in chunks", "1 teaspoon salt, more to taste", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more to taste", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1 tablespoon fennel seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Start a charcoal or wood fire or preheat a gas grill.
