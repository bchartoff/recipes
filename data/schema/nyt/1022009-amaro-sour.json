A maraschino cherry and half a grapefruit wheel are muddled with sugar early on, to sweeten and flavor the drink, while another cherry and half-wheel are added just before serving. That allows the fruit to slowly become infused with gin and amaro, creating garnish and boozy snack. Reach for a sweeter-leaning amaro, or throw caution to the bitter wind and grab something more intense. If you want to balance the amaro\u2019s bitter edges with a touch more sweetness, add a dash or three of the maraschino cherry syrup to your shaker or serve with extra cherries for middrink pops of sweetness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rebekah Peppler"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/19Soursrex2-Amaro/merlin_185055813_6c2edf1d-f796-4a60-833a-d5e0c801d498-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cocktails", "keywords": "amaro, cherries, grapefruit, lemon", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 370}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 maraschino cherries", "1 grapefruit wheel, halved", "1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "2 ounces gin", "1 ounce amaro, such as Amaro Nonino, Montenegro or Averna", "3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice", "Ice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a cocktail shaker, add 1 cherry, 1 half-wheel of grapefruit and the sugar.
