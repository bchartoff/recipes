While Ms. Forte loves whole roasted brussels sprouts, she knows many people don\u2019t like the woodsy center. In this simple warm salad, only the tender outside leaves are used. Just peel the leaves away, discard the core, then saut\u00e9 with jumble of fresh spinach and dress with a white wine-maple syrup vinaigrette. A handful of Marcona almonds finishes it off for a a pleasant crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/14/health/wellveggie_sprouted1/wellveggie_sprouted1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick", "keywords": "almonds, baby spinach, brussels sprouts, dairy-free, gluten-free, healthy, kosher, vegan, vegetarian, fall, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 75}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "18 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "96 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound brussels sprouts", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar or Champagne vinegar", "1 tablespoon maple syrup", "4 cups baby spinach", "2 generous pinches of sea salt", "1/2 cup Marcona almonds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Working with one brussels sprout at a time, peel off each individual leaf, starting from the outside and working toward the middle.
