{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet Potatoes With Tsimmes Glaze", "description": "Traditional tsimmes is a stew of sorts that includes sweet potatoes, carrots, one or two kinds of dried fruits, and spices. It\u2019s usually served as a side dish at Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, but it also makes frequent appearances on the Passover Seder table. The word \u201ctsimmes\u201d sometimes means a fuss or commotion, or even a muddle. This version is anything but fussy and definitely not muddled. Here, halved sweet potatoes are simply roasted and served with a scrumptious glaze that includes prunes, orange juice, fresh ginger and a hit of lemon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/17/dining/12Passoverrex3/merlin_184703367_a620d865-ac99-4365-8b23-9d3fc655dd16-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "dairy-free, vegetarian, ginger, orange, prune, sweet potato, passover, rosh hashana", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 178}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 small sweet potatoes (6 to 8 ounces each), halved lengthwise", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 navel or Cara Cara oranges, zested and juiced", "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice", "3 tablespoons honey", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 (1 1/2-inch) piece of fresh ginger, peeled and cut into fine slivers", "1/2 cup bite-size pitted prunes, quartered"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Position a rack on the lower third of the oven and heat oven to 400 degrees.
