{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "G\u00e2teau Breton", "description": "With its soft, buttery crumb, this classic French cake is similar to a giant shortbread, though moister and more tender. Its hidden prune filling is traditional, although you can use other dried fruit, such as apricot, instead. In France you sometimes even see bakers sandwiching melted chocolate or caramel between the layers. This keeps well if you want to bake it 1 or 2 days ahead. Store it well wrapped at room temperature.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/02/dining/02COOKBOOKS-slide-68RF/02COOKBOOKS-slide-68RF-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "apricot, prune, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 236}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 442, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "21 milligrams", "sugarContent": "20 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/100 grams pitted prunes or dried apricots (about 16)", "2 tablespoons/30 milliliters rum", "2 1/4 cups plus 2 1/2 tablespoons/300 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/200 grams superfine sugar", "Large pinch flaky sea salt", "8 1/2 ounces/240 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks plus 1 tablespoon), diced, more for greasing pan", "6 extra-large egg yolks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small pot over medium-high heat, combine prunes, rum and 2 tablespoons water.
