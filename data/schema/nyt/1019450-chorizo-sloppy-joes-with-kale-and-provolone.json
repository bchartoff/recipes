{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chorizo Sloppy Joes With Kale and Provolone", "description": "Matthew Hyland \u2014 a chef and owner of the Emily and Emmy Squared restaurants in New York \u2014 is known for making exemplary pizza and hamburgers. But his sandwich game is strong as well. This one recalls the flavors that he and Emily first experienced as college students in Bristol, R.I., which has supported a sizable Portuguese community since at least the late 19th century. It is a sloppy Joe of sorts, built on a base of crumbled Mexican-style chorizo, which Hyland uses in place of chouri\u00e7o, a Portuguese sausage also spiced with paprika and garlic. He uses chorizo because he can\u2019t regularly find chouri\u00e7o in his neighborhood stores. I can, sometimes. Other times, not, and I can\u2019t find Mexican chorizo either. Then I use Guatemalan chorizo instead. It\u2019s a great sandwich whichever member of the chorizo family you use. Do not stint on the olives, banana peppers or celery seeds. The celery seeds especially, a nod to one of the toppings scattered on a Rhode Island \u201cNew York System\u201d hot dog, are a perfect touch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/12/magazine/12mag-eat-image1/12mag-eat-image1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches", "keywords": "baby kale, bell pepper, chorizo, crushed canned tomatoes, pickled banana peppers, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 286}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1115, "unsaturatedFatContent": "49 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "84 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "54 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "31 grams", "sodiumContent": "3106 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds Mexican or Guatemalan chorizo or Portuguese chouri\u00e7o, casings removed", "2 teaspoons whole cumin seeds", "1 large green bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced", "1 medium-size red onion, peeled and thinly sliced", "2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "1 cup canned crushed tomatoes", "2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce, preferably one of the thicker varieties, like Cholula or Frank\u2019s", "4 Portuguese-style rolls or sesame-seed hero rolls", "8 thin slices sharp Provolone", "4 handfuls baby kale or spinach leaves", "1/2 cup sliced pickled banana peppers", "1/2 cup pitted and chopped green olives, like Castelvetrano", "1 tablespoon celery seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the chorizo filling for the sandwich.
