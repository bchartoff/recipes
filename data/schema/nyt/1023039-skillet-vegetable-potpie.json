{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Skillet Vegetable Potpie", "description": "Loaded with the season\u2019s finest offerings, this pie comes together in one skillet and manages to be hearty yet light. Leek provides a sweet and aromatic base, potatoes add body, fennel delivers an earthy note and asparagus imparts crisp freshness. (You could also use broccoli or green beans.) Sour cream in the base offers a slight tang and keeps the sauce light. Be sure to chop all of your vegetables around the same size to ensure they cook evenly and are tender by the time the pastry is golden. If you like, add other seasonal vegetables like peas or fava beans in the spring, or cauliflower or brussels sprouts in the fall and winter. (Frozen vegetables work well, too.) When using store-bought puff pastry, thaw it in the fridge overnight. If you don\u2019t have an ovenproof 9- or 10-inch skillet, simply transfer the mixture to a similar-sized round or square baking dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/15/dining/hm-vegetable-pot-pie/merlin_201503022_55df2279-817b-4619-a067-0a9996b4efe4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, potato, potpie, puff pastry, sour cream, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1624}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 leek, finely chopped into \u00bc-inch pieces", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 fennel bulb, cored and finely diced into \u00bc-inch pieces (about 14 ounces)", "2 medium Yukon Gold or red-skinned potatoes, peeled and finely diced into \u00bc-inch pieces (about 14 ounces)", "16 to 20 asparagus spears, trimmed and sliced into \u00bc-inch pieces (about 12 ounces)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "Black pepper", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling", "1 cup vegetable stock", "8 ounces sour cream", "1 bunch of chives, finely sliced (about \u00bd cup)", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 cup grated Gruy\u00e8re (about 3 ounces)", "1 (14-ounce) sheet puff pastry, completely thawed", "1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon of water"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place an oven rack in the middle position, and heat oven to 450 degrees.
