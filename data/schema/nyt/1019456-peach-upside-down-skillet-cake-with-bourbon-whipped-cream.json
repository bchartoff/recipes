{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peach Upside-Down Skillet Cake With Bourbon Whipped Cream", "description": "A lush combination of a Southern upside-down cake and a French tarte tatin, this cake is deeply caramelized on top and light and fluffy beneath. The chef Virginia Willis, who put the recipe together, uses a whole vanilla bean, but if you don't feel like making that investment, a teaspoon of strong pure vanilla extract is fine. She uses a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, but a heavy nonstick one would work too. The whipped cream is optional, as is the bourbon that brightens it; you can add vanilla, confectioners' sugar or both if you prefer.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/dining/08southernrex3/merlin_141673635_fb9375ce-a9cf-4ec3-819f-8dd59f42f6d8-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "bourbon, cake flour, heavy cream, peach, sour cream, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 370}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 420, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "47 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "106 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium peaches (about 1 1/2 pounds/680 grams), unpeeled and cut into 1/3-inch-thick wedges", "Juice of 1 lemon", "1 cup/130 grams cake flour, not self-rising", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "5 ounces/140 grams unsalted butter (1 stick plus 2 tablespoons), at cool room temperature", "1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped, or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "2 large eggs", "1/2 cup sour cream", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1 tablespoon bourbon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
