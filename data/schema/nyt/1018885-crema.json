You can sometimes find it in stores, but it\u2019s very simple to make at home by combining sour cream with heavy cream and lime juice (you could use buttermilk instead) and allowing it to set up at room temperature for a few hours, until it turns into a kind of liquid velvet. It\u2019s marvelous with fish tacos, as a dressing for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018884-hot-slaw-mexican-style\">hot slaw,</a> or drizzled over roasted carrots or sweet potatoes.
