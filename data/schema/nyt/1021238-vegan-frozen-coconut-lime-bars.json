The no-bake graham cracker crust gets topped with softened store-bought, dairy-free ice cream mixed with shredded coconut and fresh lime juice for a dessert that\u2019s as easy to put together as it is delicious. Be sure to use unsweetened, finely shredded (also called desiccated) coconut for this recipe; regular shredded or flaked coconut will be too coarse.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/dining/lime-bars/merlin_173816433_9875b0c6-71e5-442c-86e1-153e2abc2cdb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "9 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets, dessert", "keywords": "coconut, coconut oil, graham cracker crumbs, ice cream, sugar, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, fourth of july, labor day, memorial day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 298}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray", "1 1/2 cups/180 grams graham cracker crumbs (from about 12 graham cracker sheets)", "2 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 cup/45 grams unsweetened, desiccated coconut", "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon/95 milliliters coconut oil, at room temperature", "2 pints/1 liter coconut or vanilla flavored non-dairy ice cream (preferably a brand made with coconut milk)", "2 limes, zested, plus 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Spray a 9-by-9-inch pan with cooking spray and line with two overlapping sheets of parchment paper to create overhang on all sides."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt in a medium bowl.
