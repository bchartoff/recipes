{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Breasts With Fennel and Lemon\u00a0", "description": "Lemon is chicken\u2019s best friend \u2014 stuffed whole inside a roasting bird with a sprig of rosemary; wrapped in foil, baked soft and pur\u00e9ed for a sauce, \u00e0 la Jean-Georges Vongerichten; or tossed with fennel and egg yolk for a rich, tangy sauce as in this recipe from the food writer Marlena Spieler. It is a simple, rich and wonderfully elegant way to prepare the humble chicken breast. First, lightly brown the chicken and remove it from the pan. Add the fennel, wine, lemon zest, broth and a pinch of cinnamon (trust us) to the pan and bring it all to a boil, reducing until it thickens. Return the chicken to the pan and let it simmer while you beat a couple of egg yolks and some lemon juice together. Incorporate a bit of the pan sauce into the egg yolk mixture, then add it all to the pan. Cook a bit more until the sauce is creamy and your mouth waters with anticipation.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "The New York Times"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/21/dining/21CHICBREAST-LEMONFENNEL/21CHICBREAST-LEMONFENNEL-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 229}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 407, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "975 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 lemon", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts", "Salt to taste", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium large fennel bulb, sliced lengthwise and cut in strips", "1 1/2 cups dry white wine such as pinot grigio", "1 cup chicken broth", "1 pinch cinnamon (about 1/8 teaspoon)", "2 egg yolks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Zest lemon and slice zest into matchsticks.
