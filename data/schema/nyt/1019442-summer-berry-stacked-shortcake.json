{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Summer Berry Stacked Shortcake", "description": "This stacked shortcake gives a classic summer dessert the large-format (think sheet cake and slab pies) treatment with big tender biscuits layered with juicy berries, and tangy yogurt whipped cream. Use any seasonal berries you like, but if you\u2019d like to use strawberries, hull and cut them into halves if they are small or quarters if they are large. (Note that the juiciest summer berries won\u2019t need as much sugar. If the berries leave juices on your hands when you handle them, cut the sugar in the berry mixture to 1 tablespoon.)", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/29/dining/29cooking/yossy-berry-shortcake-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "One 9-inch cake", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "berries, greek yogurt, dessert, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 120}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters buttermilk, chilled", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters heavy cream, chilled", "1 large egg, cold", "8 tablespoons/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), cold and cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 teaspoons turbinado sugar", "About 5 cups/700 grams mixed summer berries", "1 to 2 tablespoons granulated sugar (for ripe summer or store-bought berries, respectively)", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters Greek yogurt", "1/4 cup/30 grams confectioners' sugar (unsifted)", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
