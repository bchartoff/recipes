{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fettuccine With Merguez and Mint Pesto", "description": "For a pasta dish with sausage that\u2019s bold and rustic, easy to whip up for dinner but intriguing enough for entertaining (the recipe can be doubled), I opted for merguez, the North African lamb sausage. The trick is having a market that sells merguez, or order it in bulk online to keep a supply in the freezer. To the merguez, I added the flavors of Morocco: mint, garlic, lemon, sun-dried tomatoes, olives and a dusting of ground cumin. Thanks to some pasta water, these components all came together admirably to dress the pasta and suit the Bordeaux.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/26/dining/26PAIRING-BORDEAUX-WEB/26PAIRING-WEB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "fettuccine, kalamata olives, merguez sausage, mint, pine nuts, sun-dried tomato, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 135}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 491, "unsaturatedFatContent": "33 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "46 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "668 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large cloves garlic", "1/4 cup pine nuts", "2/3 cup, packed, fresh mint leaves (about 2 small bunches)", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 large onion, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 pound fresh merguez sausage, casing removed", "6 sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and finely slivered", "15 Kalamata olives, pitted", "8 ounces dried fettuccine, preferably spinach", "2 tablespoons lemon juice", "Salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pesto: Turn on food processor, and drop garlic through feed tube to mince.
