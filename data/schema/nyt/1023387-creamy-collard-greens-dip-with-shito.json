This dip can be served as an appetizer, side dish or as the star of a series of smaller plates. And its texture is both inviting and distinct, creamy and wholly spiced. Ms. Burrell serves the dip with crunchy fritters made with rice and fonio, a tiny grain popular throughout West Africa. Pairing the dip with a baguette, a bowl of tortilla chips or slices of toasted bread would also make a solid meal.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Bryan Washington"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/07/magazine/07mag-eat/07mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dips and spreads, appetizer", "keywords": "collard greens, shito", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 113}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup canola or olive oil", "1 yellow onion, diced", "1 red bell pepper, finely diced", "1 jalape\u00f1o, finely diced (seeded if desired)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "5 garlic cloves, minced", "1 cup chicken stock", "2 cups heavy cream", "4 ounces cream cheese", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons shito (see Tip)", "4 cups chopped and drained <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021773-lowcountry-collard-greens\">braised</a>, canned or thawed frozen collard greens (see Tip)", "2 cups shredded white Cheddar (8 ounces)", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "Sliced baguette (optional), for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the broiler with the rack 6 to 8 inches from the heat source."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high.
