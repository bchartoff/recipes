{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pickled Peaches With Sweet Spices", "description": "I love the balance of sweet, sour and spice in this recipe. These are refrigerator pickles, meant to be kept in the refrigerator, where they will keep for up to two months; so you could pull them out for Thanksgiving, though I doubt you will be able to resist them for that long. Although this recipe calls for a lot of sugar, you will not be consuming the syrup so don\u2019t be alarmed by it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/07/science/06recipehealth/06recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "2 to 2 1/2 pints", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, vegan, vegetarian, fall, summer, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 23}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "7 milligrams", "sugarContent": "51 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 medium-size or large ripe-but-firm peaches", "Juice of 1 large lemon", "1 tablespoon plus 16 cloves", "1 1/2 teaspoons allspice, cracked or coarsely ground in a spice mill", "1 cinnamon stick", "1 vanilla bean, cut in half", "1 cup cider vinegar", "1/2 cup water", "1 cup raw brown (turbinado) sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and drop in peaches.
