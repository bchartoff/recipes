{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Homemade Ginger Beer", "description": "To get the full aromatic flush and fizzy burn of fresh ginger, you have to make your own ginger beer. It is amazingly simple. There\u2019s no sterilization needed, and this method is forgiving \u2014 you can actually play about with the levels and ingredients. Moreover, the resulting ginger beer blows anything else you\u2019ve ever had straight out of contention. Take a pinch of packaged yeast and something acidic for the yeast to thrive in (like lemon or lime juice or cream of tartar) along with some sugar syrup and grated ginger, lob it all in a plastic bottle of distilled or spring water, shake it up and stash it somewhere dark and warm for two days. After two days you stop the fermentation by chilling it in the fridge. That\u2019s it. The result is a cloudy, dry mixer with pinprick carbonation and a straight-up goose of fresh ginger. That is thrilling come dark \u2019n\u2019 stormy hour, not just for its authenticity and superior flavor but also because you can now brag about your homemade ginger beer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Toby Cecchini"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/23/t-magazine/23casestudy-darkstormy/23casestudy-darkstormy-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "ginger, lemon, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 123}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 134, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "33 milligrams", "sugarContent": "32 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces freshly grated ginger", "4 ounces lemon juice", "6 ounces simple syrup", "1/8 teaspoon commercial baker\u2019s, brewer\u2019s or Red Star Pasteur Champagne yeast", "20 ounces non-chlorinated water (filtered, distilled or spring)", "1 to 4 grams cream of tartar (not necessary, but traditional, to help the yeast and bacteria thrive)."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Take a 1.5-liter plastic bottle of spring water and empty it into a clean pitcher.
