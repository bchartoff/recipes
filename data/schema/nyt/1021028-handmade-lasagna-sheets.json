{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Handmade Lasagna Sheets", "description": "There\u2019s nothing quite like <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021031-the-big-lasagna\">lasagna</a> made with thin, silky sheets of fresh pasta. The noodles absorb the sauces as the dish bakes, and everything separate becomes one. Each bite will melt in your mouth. When rolling out the dough, sprinkle generously with flour to prevent sticking. And if you can\u2019t cook the pasta right away, make sure to spread flour abundantly between each sheet because the longer it sits, the more it will threaten to stick back together. If after assembling the lasagna you are left with uncooked sheets of pasta, cut them into noodles, toss with flour, and freeze on a baking sheet in a single layer before transferring into a freezer bag. Freeze for up to a month, and to cook, just drop into boiling, salted water.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/29/dining/27Lasagnarex3/27Lasagnarex3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "About 20 (13-inch-long) pasta sheets (1 3/4 pounds)", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, noodles, pastas, project, main course", "keywords": "00 flour, eggs", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 527}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups/510 grams\u00a000 or all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting", "4 whole large eggs", "5 to 6 large egg yolks"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mound the flour in the center of a large mixing bowl.
