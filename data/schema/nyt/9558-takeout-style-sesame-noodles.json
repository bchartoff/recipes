In 2007, he helped The Times drill down into the taste history of sesame noodles in America, and specifically to the ones made and sold by Shorty Tang at the restaurant Hwa Yuan on East Broadway. Soft and luxurious, bathed in an emulsified mixture of sesame paste and peanut butter, rendered vivid and fiery by chili oil and sweetened by sugar, then cut by vinegar, this version brings home what used to be classic New York takeout. \u201cThe art is in the balance,\u201d Mr. Schoenfeld said at the time, \u201cbetween the salt and sweet, the sweet and the fire, and the fire and the acidity.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/23/dining/23COOKING-TAKEOUTSESAMENOODLES2/23COOKING-TAKEOUTSESAMENOODLES2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, noodles, times classics", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, peanut butter, sesame paste, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 4357}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 628, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "90 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "21 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "797 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound noodles, frozen or (preferably) fresh", "2 tablespoons sesame oil, plus a splash", "3 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 tablespoons Chinese rice vinegar", "2 tablespoons Chinese sesame paste", "1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 tablespoon finely grated ginger", "2 teaspoons minced garlic", "2 teaspoons chili-garlic paste, or to taste", "Half a cucumber, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/8-inch by 1/8-inch by 2-inch sticks", "1/4 cup chopped roasted peanuts"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
