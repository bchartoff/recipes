Making your own corn stock deepens the flavor of this dish, but if you don\u2019t have the time, chicken stock will work. The dish is also pleasingly light, for risotto \u2014 finishing the dish by folding in airy whipped cream adds richness without also adding heft. Add the cream quickly and carefully right before serving. If it sits in the hot risotto it will melt \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world, of course, since you\u2019ll still have a wonderfully creamy risotto.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Emily Weinstein"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/19/dining/19corn/19corn-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "corn, leek, risotto, white wine, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 721}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 698, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "87 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "1572 milligrams", "sugarContent": "15 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 cups corn stock (see recipe below) or chicken stock", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 leek, white and light green parts only, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper", "1 cup arborio rice", "1/2 cup dry white wine", "1 1/2 cups raw corn kernels (from about 2 ears corn)", "1 cup grated Parmesan cheese", "1/4 cup heavy cream", "2 tablespoons minced chives (optional)", "2 corn cobs (kernels removed and reserved for risotto)", "1 onion, cut into quarters", "1 carrot, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 celery rib, cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces", "Dark green leaves from 1 leek (reserve white and light green parts for risotto)", "2 cloves garlic, smashed", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "For the risotto:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring the corn stock or chicken stock to a simmer in a saucepan and keep it simmering as you prepare the risotto."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a wide, high-sided saut\u00e9 pan over medium-low heat.
