{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Warm Fig and Chocolate Sponge Cake", "description": "This dessert is somewhere between a sponge cake and a clafoutis: light and airy, yet rich from the addition of dark chocolate and rum. Make sure you use really ripe, in-season figs, as they make all the difference here. The figs release their juices with the caramel, rum and orange to create a sauce that is perfect to scoop over the sponge cake when serving. For a more concentrated flavor, roast your figs separately before adding them to the caramel. A spoonful of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is all you need here, but you could serve this with some vanilla ice cream, if you\u2019re looking for a supertreat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/16/dining/16ottorex01/16ottorex01-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "chocolate, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, figs, orange, rum, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 137}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup/100 grams superfine (caster) sugar", "2 tablespoons dark rum", "2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest, plus 1 tablespoon juice (from 1 orange)", "12 ripe black figs (about 14 ounces/400 grams), tough stems removed and figs halved lengthwise", "2 eggs, whites and yolks separated", "1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons/100 milliliters heavy cream (double cream)", "1/4 cup/35 grams all-purpose (plain) flour", "2 tablespoons/15 grams cocoa powder", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/4 teaspoon flaky sea salt", "1 1/2 ounces/40 grams dark chocolate (70 percent), roughly chopped into scant 1/2-inch/1-centimeter pieces", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit/190 degrees Celsius."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar to a small, oven-proof, high-sided saut\u00e9 pan with a 6-inch/15-centimeter base (or similar).
