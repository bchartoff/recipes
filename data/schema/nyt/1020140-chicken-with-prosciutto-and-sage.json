{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken With Prosciutto and Sage", "description": "Versatility is what you get with this dish, which borrows its flavors from the Italian staple saltimbocca, a combination of veal, prosciutto and sage. Here, the dark meat of chicken takes the place of veal, and instead of meat slices topped with the ham and herbs, there are plump bundles with the sage inside. Boneless chicken thighs make for easier slicing. Leaving the skin on to brown, provides more flavor, especially with some of the sage tucked underneath. Fingerling potatoes simmer as the chicken braises, and fresh peas contribute a touch of spring for a one-pot meal, not instant but hardly demanding. A final, judicious splash of balsamic vinegar intensifies the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/17/dining/11pairrex/merlin_153033765_9dc61a90-1c2b-44ab-b109-77f27ba72f89-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, fennel, fingerling potatoes, prosciutto, sage, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 120}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 430, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "31 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "860 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon unsalted butter", "6 large boneless, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 ounces each)", "1/2 cup finely chopped fennel bulb (about 1/4 bulb)", "1/2 cup finely chopped red onion (about 1/2 onion)", "Salt and ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon ground sage", "18 medium-size fingerling potatoes (about 1 pound)", "1 1/2 cups chicken stock", "18 fresh sage leaves (from a small bunch), plus a few sprigs for garnish", "12 thin slices prosciutto (about 5 ounces)", "2/3 cup shelled peas", "1 teaspoon good-quality balsamic vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt butter in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat.
