{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Figs in Blankets With Port-Mustard Sauce", "description": "This clever riff on the classic pigs in blankets comes from a Champagne bar, with branches in San Francisco and New York, where they\u2019re made with fresh figs. Using dried figs gives them year-round adaptability. The figs are plumped in port and stuffed with Stilton, though any blue cheese will be fine. The port used for soaking is reduced to a syrup, and flavors a mustard sauce. The figs in blankets are a great holiday tidbit with white, red, ros\u00e9 or sparkling wine, with cocktails or punch. Serve them alongside a salad or as part of a cheese course. They\u2019re easily prepared in advance and frozen. The puff pastry is quick to prepare in a food processor using frozen butter. The figs in blankets can also be made with purchased puff pastry; one pound is what you\u2019ll need.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/dining/14pairrex/merlin_163923747_53e52966-5f6d-477b-b207-18a1d63fbf16-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "48 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "snack, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, dijon mustard, dried figs, sour cream, stilton, tawny port", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 33}, "recipeIngredient": ["48 small dried mission figs, stemmed, or 24 larger dried figs, stemmed and halved vertically", "1 1/2 cups tawny port", "1 cup/225 grams salted butter (2 sticks), frozen", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling", "1/2 cup/125 milliliters full-fat sour cream", "3 ounces Stilton or other blue cheese", "1/3 cup Dijon mustard"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place figs in a 2-quart saucepan, add port, bring to a simmer, remove from heat and let soak, covered but not refrigerated, overnight."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dough: Cut the frozen butter in 8 pieces and grate using a shredding disc of a food processor.
