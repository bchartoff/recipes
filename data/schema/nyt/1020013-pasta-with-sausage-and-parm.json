{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Sausage and Parm", "description": "<i>This is a no-recipe recipe, a recipe without an ingredients list or steps. It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nI like cooking the sausages twice for this pasta dish: first as links, to firm them up; then as coins, which get good and crisp in a melting knob of butter, releasing fat that, with a few leaves of sage and a splash of the water in which you cooked the pasta, makes for a terrific sauce for the pound of orecchiette in your pasta pot.\n\nStart by putting some neutral oil in a hot pan and searing the links, pricking them with a fork if they threaten to split. Boil your pasta water, salted as always. Retrieve the sausages from the pan when the skins are golden and crisp, let cool slightly, then cut into coins. While the pasta cooks, wipe out the pan and add some butter to it and the sausage coins; cook over medium heat. Scatter sage leaves over the whole, drain the pasta, and add a little of the pasta water to the pan with the sausage to make a velvety sauce. Combine with the pasta, grate a lot of Parmesan over the top, and let me know how it goes.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17norecipe-orecchiette/merlin_147768564_609465d0-01b5-44f7-b1be-61dca4756772-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pastas, sausages", "keywords": "main course, orecchiette, sage, sausage", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 224}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null}
