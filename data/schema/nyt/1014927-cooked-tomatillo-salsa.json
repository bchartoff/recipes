Drizzle in a drop of tomatillo pur\u00e9e to test the heat. If it makes a lot of noise and sputters immediately, the oil is hot enough. Add the tomatillo pur\u00e9e, and stir constantly until it thickens and begins to stick to the pan, about 5 minutes. When you run your spoon down the middle of the pan it should leave a canal. Stir in the stock, bring to a simmer, and simmer 10 to 15 minutes, stirring often. The sauce should coat the front and back of your spoon. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove from the heat. Serve warm or at room temperature."}], "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014927-cooked-tomatillo-salsa"}
