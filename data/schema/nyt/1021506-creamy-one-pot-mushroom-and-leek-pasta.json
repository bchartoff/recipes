{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy One-Pot Mushroom and Leek Pasta", "description": "This deeply satisfying pasta, brimming with rich umami, is made in just one pot, an approach that bolsters its flavors. Once the leek and mushrooms are caramelized and sticking to the pot, they\u2019re deglazed to lift all the extra depth from the bottom of the pan. (Use any liquid for deglazing, whether water, wine, stock, vinegar or tomato juice.) This recipe leaves the choice of mushrooms up to you: Cremini and shiitake are a good combination, but you could even use rehydrated porcinis. If you are craving greens to cut through the richness, stir a few handfuls of baby spinach into the pasta just before you turn off the heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/28/dining/hm-one-pot-pasta/merlin_180213573_2640b2ea-44d7-4943-a67a-124da9b65d01-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, one pot, pastas, main course", "keywords": "leek, mushroom, orecchiette, penne, ricotta", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3214}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons olive oil", "1 leek, white part only, finely sliced (about 5 ounces)", "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "3 cups mixed mushrooms, such as cremini, shiitake or oyster, torn or sliced (about 6 ounces)", "1 lemon, halved", "1 pound short pasta, such as orecchiette, cavatappi, gemelli or penne", "4 cups vegetable stock", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup whole-milk ricotta", "1/2 to 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a wide, deep 12-inch skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high.
