{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Lamb and Chickpea Stew", "description": "Stews and braises are for year-round cooking, but warmer weather calls for a lighter approach. This stew is quite brothy, and full of greens, wilted in olive oil with green garlic, carrots and fava beans or peas. A healthy sprinkling of roughly chopped mint adds brightness. It\u2019s important to use dried chickpeas, because they add flavor to the broth as they slowly cook with the lamb. And an overnight soak is essential: The soaked dried chickpeas will swell to three times their original size, which gives them the proper creamy texture when cooked.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/16/dining/16kitchenweb1/merlin_137722986_6163d008-d9a8-4d43-94d1-5c13eb33513a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "chickpea, fava beans, lamb, main course, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 131}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1070, "unsaturatedFatContent": "37 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "44 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "72 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "63 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "29 grams", "sodiumContent": "1287 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked in cold water overnight and drained", "4 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 3-inch chunks", "Salt and pepper", "4 whole cloves", "1 onion, peeled and halved", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "2 cups chopped leeks or onions", "1/4 cup chopped green garlic shoots, or 2 cloves garlic, minced", "Pinch of red pepper flakes", "1 bunch small carrots, trimmed and peeled", "1 pound chard or other sturdy leafy greens, sliced in 2-inch wide ribbons", "2 cups fava beans, peeled or not, or 2 cups peas", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped mint, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place chickpeas in a large soup pot.
