For the best flavor, use sweet, ripe farm stand berries: They should really smell like strawberries. The whipped cream and a touch of vodka help keep the mixture from forming ice crystals \u2014 up to a point. You\u2019ll still want to make this cake the day before you plan to serve it, since its texture is best in the first 24 hours and it can take up to six hours to freeze.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/dining/10tanis5/merlin_174283650_f4d4ec0c-1750-4c2b-af44-1ab2251c1558-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, ice creams and sorbets, dessert", "keywords": "coconut milk, heavy cream, strawberries, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 179}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 quarts/about 1 kilogram strawberries, preferably small, pretty ones", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar, plus 3 tablespoons for sauce", "1 cup/240 milliliters coconut milk", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon vodka", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "1 cup/85 grams toasted coconut flakes, for garnish (see Note)", "Basil or mint leaves, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Briefly rinse berries with cold water, then lay them out on a clean tea towel.
