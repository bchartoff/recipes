Using a fork or pastry cutter, work half of the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse meal. Quickly work the remaining butter into the dough until the biggest pieces are the size of lima beans. Drizzle in the water in several additions, tossing and mixing between each. (It should look rather ropy and rough.) Stop adding water when a few bits of dry flour remain in the bottom of the bowl; do not overwork the dough or it will become tough. Gather two-thirds of the dough and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Do the same with the remaining third. Flatten into disks. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. When the dough is chilled, roll out the larger piece and line a nine-inch pie pan."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If rhubarb is thick, peel it.
