{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate and Almond Tiger Cake", "description": "This almond cake is based on financiers, the small, usually ingot-shaped cakes first made in Paris in the late 1880s. The pastry chef Lasne created and named them for his stockbroker clients, keeping them easy and neat to eat on the run \u2014 no fuss, no muss. Made with egg whites, ground nuts and a lot of melted butter, the recipe is invitingly riffable. My favorite take is the tigr\u00e9, a round, chocolate-speckled cake topped with a dab of ganache. Years ago, I misread the name, and I\u2019ve called them tiger cakes ever since. My play on the tiger is a large cake, a little less rich than the original, run through with chopped chocolate and covered with enough ganache to leave telltale smudges.
