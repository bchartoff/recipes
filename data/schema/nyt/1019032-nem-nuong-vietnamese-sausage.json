{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nem Nuong (Vietnamese Sausage)", "description": "Traditionally grilled over charcoal, these little sausages also cook up beautifully in a cast-iron pan. Serve them in a bowl over rice noodles or steamed jasmine rice with fresh mint and cilantro, cucumbers and pickled carrots. Top with green chiles and toasted peanuts, then drizzle with fish sauce and lime. Or, use to make banh mi sandwiches. Be sure to use ground pork with enough fat or you'll end up with dry, flavorless sausage. Twenty percent by weight is a good ratio, though 25 doesn\u2019t hurt. If the ground pork available to you is too lean, ask the butcher to replace two ounces or so of the lean meat with ground pork belly or bacon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/05/magazine/05eat2/05mag-05eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT55M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "sausages", "keywords": "fish sauce, ground pork, jasmine rice, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 37}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 347, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "20 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "816 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon jasmine rice", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "2 tablespoons fish sauce", "2 teaspoons pounded or very finely grated garlic", "1 pound ground pork", "Canola, grapeseed or other neutral-tasting oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set a cast-iron pan over medium heat, and add rice.
