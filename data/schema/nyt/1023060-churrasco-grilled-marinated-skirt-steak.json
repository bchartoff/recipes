{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Churrasco (Grilled Marinated Skirt Steak)", "description": "Like so many of the best Puerto Rican dishes, churrasco \u2014 garlicky wood-fire-grilled steak served with chimichurri \u2014 starts by tenderizing a tougher cut of meat (skirt steak) with a flavorful marinade. Although its origins are Argentinian and Brazilian (the word churrasco encompassing grilled meats in both Spanish and Portuguese), variations on the dish are Latin American staples. This recipe kicks up a classic Puerto Rican marinade with a bit of adobo seasoning, and then served with wasakaka, an herbaceous sauce from the Dominican Republic using lime juice. The steak should be grilled over an open fire (the smoke is key), but a gas grill will do, as will a cast-iron skillet.
