If you are making the schmaltz from scratch for this recipe (and you should if you want the gribenes), do use the onion, which lends an incomparable browned sweetness to the mix. The gribenes, which are the crispy bits of chicken skin that fry in the rendered fat, make an excellent garnish. (They may be strained out of store-bought schmaltz; if you don\u2019t have them, just omit them here.) This recipe goes particularly well with a nice roasted chicken, whose flavor underscores the schmaltz.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/10/dining/10SCHMALTZ/10SCHMALTZ-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch", "keywords": "brussels sprouts, schmaltz, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 141}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 139, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "291 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed, large ones halved, small ones left whole", "3 tablespoons schmaltz (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017054-schmaltz-and-gribenes\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>)", "2 smashed garlic cloves", "2 bay leaves", "Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste", "1/2 cup gribenes, roughly chopped, for garnish (optional, <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017054-schmaltz-and-gribenes\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
