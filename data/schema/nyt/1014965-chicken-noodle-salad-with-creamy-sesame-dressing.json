Add the chicken breasts, and bring back to a simmer. Skim off any foam that rises. Cover partially, reduce the heat to low and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through (it should register 160 on a meat thermometer at the thickest section). Allow the chicken to cool in the broth if there is time. Remove the chicken from the broth when cool enough to handle. Remove and discard the skin. Remove from the bone and shred, pulling strips of chicken off the top of the breast. Pull with the grain and the meat will come apart naturally. Strain the chicken broth, and refrigerate overnight. The next morning, skim off and discard the fat, and freeze the broth in smaller containers or freezer bags.\n"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cook the noodles.
