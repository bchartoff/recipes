{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chocolate Lava Cake for Two", "description": "Chocolate lava cakes gained popularity in the late 1990s thanks to the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and they have stuck around on dessert menus for good reason: They are rich chocolate cake and velvety sauce all in one, and they are surprisingly easy to make in under an hour. If you like to plan ahead, you can prepare the batter a day in advance, refrigerate it, then pop the cake into the oven when you are ready for dessert. This recipe, made in a 10-ounce baking dish, is meant for sharing, but you can also make it in two 6-ounce ramekins. Just cut the baking time to 7 to 9 minutes. Also, be sure to use chopped chocolate bars or chocolate f\u00e9ves rather than chocolate chips here. Chips are made with stabilizers that inhibit melting and will negatively affect the texture of your dessert.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yossy Arefi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/11/dining/11molten-lava-cake/ya-molten-lava-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "for two, cakes, custards and puddings", "keywords": "bittersweet chocolate, butter, egg, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1119}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 528, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "53 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "35 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "165 milligrams", "sugarContent": "43 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 ounces/85 grams bittersweet chocolate, 70 to 74 percent cacao (not chips), chopped\u00a0(about 1/2 cup)", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus more for the ramekin", "3 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more for the ramekin", "1 large egg", "1 large egg yolk", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, to serve (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees and butter a 10-ounce ramekin.
