In this recipe \u2014 pasta with spring vegetables \u2014 the meat is literally a garnish, but one with huge impact.\n\nThat meat is prosciutto, and it\u2019s briefly cooked in a bit of oil, which accomplishes two things: It intensifies the ham\u2019s salty, meaty flavor, and it makes the prosciutto crisp, turning it into a nice textural foil for the tender pasta, peas and lettuce.\n\nYou do need three pans to make this dish \u2014 a small skillet, a large skillet and a large pot for the pasta \u2014 but it\u2019s so fast that a little extra cleanup seems worth the trouble.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/05/dining/peapasta-still/peapasta-still-mediumThreeByTwo440-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, pasta, peas, prosciutto, spring", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 198}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 795, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "101 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "9 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "925 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 to 3 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips", "1 pound pasta", "2 tablespoons butter", "1 shallot, minced", "Black pepper to taste", "2 cups peas, fresh or frozen", "1 head Bibb or Boston lettuce (about 6 ounces), cored, leaves cut into 3/4-inch slices", "1/2 cup chicken or vegetable stock or dry white wine, more as needed", "1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to boil and salt it.
