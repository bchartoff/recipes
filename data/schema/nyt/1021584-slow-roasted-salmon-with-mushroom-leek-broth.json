{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Roasted Salmon With Mushroom-Leek Broth", "description": "This warming dish is inspired by Japanese ochazuke, a comforting bowl of rice with green tea poured on top. Traditionally, the meal may also be finished with grilled fish, sashimi or other toppings, but there is room for variation: You could swap out the hot tea for dashi, broth or other liquids. In this approach, the salmon is slow-roasted \u2014 which helps render some of the fat and keeps the fish meltingly tender \u2014 while a light shiitake mushroom and leek broth simmers. Divide cooked rice among bowls, spoon the salmon and vegetable broth on top, and finish with fresh ginger and a drizzle of sesame oil.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/04/dining/sl-salmon-with-leek-broth/merlin_180213657_781c411b-5ba2-4bd6-8a8a-7a9e8b25b280-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, seafood, soups and stews, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "fall, spring, winter, ginger, leek, mushroom, rice, salmon, sesame oil, shiitake", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 803}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (1 1/2-pound) piece skin-on or skinless salmon", "2 tablespoons sesame oil, plus more for serving", "Kosher salt", "2 medium leeks, trimmed, white and light greens cut crosswise into 1-inch rounds (about 2 cups)", "8 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, destemmed and sliced", "4 cups chicken broth", "2 cups cooked short-grain white rice", "Fresh ginger, peeled and cut into very thin matchsticks, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 325 degrees.\u00a0Place salmon on a baking sheet.
