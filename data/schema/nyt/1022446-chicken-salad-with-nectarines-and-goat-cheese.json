{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Salad With Nectarines and Goat Cheese", "description": "Crunchy and creamy, sweet and tangy, this main dish salad is a new take on the goat cheese, spinach and fruit salads of the 1980s. Lemon-kissed nectarines and shallots are tossed with chicken, pita chips and greens. A mature green like spinach adds heft, but any salad green works. Goat cheese cream hidden beneath the salad is a delightful surprise; you get a bit of the tangy cream every few bites. Make it vegetarian by nixing the chicken and adding white beans to the nectarines in Step 1. Embellish freely with thinly sliced beets, sunflower seeds, sliced jalape\u00f1os or soft herbs, or swap in another stone fruit like apricots or cherries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/25/dining/20NO-COOKRex1-Chicken-Nectarine-Salad/merlin_191889447_2083e49c-2774-4616-bc26-fe1c947e67c4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 491}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds ripe but firm nectarines, pitted and sliced (4 to 6)", "1 large shallot, thinly sliced", "6 tablespoons lemon juice, plus more to taste (from 2 lemons)", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 cup buttermilk, plus more as needed", "8 ounces goat cheese, preferably herbed, at room temperature", "1 tablespoon lemon zest", "3 to 4 cups shredded cooked chicken (from about 1 rotisserie chicken)\u00a0\u00a0", "1 to 2 cups lightly crushed pita chips", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste", "8 to 10 ounces salad greens, such as mature spinach, arugula or watercress"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, stir together the nectarines, shallot and lemon juice.
