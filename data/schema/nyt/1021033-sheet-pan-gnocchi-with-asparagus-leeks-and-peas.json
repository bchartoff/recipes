{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Gnocchi With Asparagus, Leeks and Peas", "description": "This sunny dinner cooks entirely in the oven on two sheet pans, so both the vegetables and gnocchi are cooked properly with minimal effort. Asparagus, shallots, leeks and peas balance out the rich, caramelized gnocchi, but you could experiment with your vegetable choices: Cut delicate vegetables in larger pieces and firmer vegetables in smaller pieces so they cook at similar rates. Refrigerated gnocchi (often labeled \u201cskillet gnocchi\u201d) work best here, but shelf-stable gnocchi are also fine. Simply boil them first.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/10/dining/ss-spring-gnocchi/merlin_171739665_66411757-3a96-4902-9fdf-88f6523c66cb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "one pot, pastas, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "asparagus, gnocchi, leek, lemon, parmesan, peas, spring, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 3159}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 (12-ounce) packages gnocchi (preferably fresh, refrigerated, precooked gnocchi)", "3 tablespoons olive oil", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 bunch asparagus (about 1 pound), trimmed and cut into thirds", "2 small leeks, trimmed, halved lengthwise, then sliced 1/2-inch thick (about 2 cups)", "2 shallots, trimmed and sliced lengthwise 1/4-inch thick", "1 cup frozen peas, thawed (or fresh peas)", "1 lemon, scrubbed", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan", "1/4 cup sliced fresh chives or parsley (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
