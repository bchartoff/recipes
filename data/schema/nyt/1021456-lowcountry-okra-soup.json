This version belongs to Amethyst Ganaway, a chef and writer of Gullah Geechee ancestry, a direct descendant of people once enslaved on the lower Atlantic Coast.\u00a0Ms. Ganaway\u2019s okra soup is not your\u00a0Louisiana-style gumbo, thick with roux and rich with sausage and shrimp. It\u2019s a simple, wholesome dish that, like the best Gullah Geechee cooking, emphasizes the freshness of its ingredients. As Ms. Ganaway advised, \u201cThe okra will naturally thicken the broth, and the fresher it is, the better it\u2019ll do the job.\u2019\u2019 Since the vegetable is cooked for just 10 minutes, it grows tender but not slimy,\u00a0while the pod\u2019s caviar-like seeds add a textural pop with every bite.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/27/magazine/27Eat/27Eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "About 3 1/2 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, soups and stews, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "butter beans, cayenne pepper, corn, okra, paprika, turkey, turkey legs, turkey necks", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 459}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons neutral oil", "2 pounds turkey necks", "1 pound smoked turkey leg or thigh meat", "1 medium white or yellow onion, quartered", "Salt", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "15 ounces (fresh or canned) diced tomatoes (about 2 cups)", "1 pound okra (fresh or frozen), trimmed and sliced into 1/2-inch pieces", "3 ears sweet corn, sliced off the cob", "2 cups cooked fresh or canned butter beans (about 15 ounces), drained", "Freshly cooked long-grain white rice, cornbread and hot sauce, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Set an 8-quart Dutch oven or similar pot over medium-high heat.
