But the colorful asparagus got lost in the quinoa, and since I love the look of the bright green asparagus against the red grain (O.K., \u201cpseudograin\u201d), I remade this and  garnished it with the steamed asparagus. The quinoa, tossed with chives, parsley, walnuts and a lemony vinaigrette, is sprinkled with dukkah before serving, a surprising touch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/24/science/25recipehealth/25recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, low sugar, vegan, vegetarian, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 16}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 402, "unsaturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "26 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "617 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 pound asparagus, trimmed", "3 cups cooked red quinoa", "1/4 cup minced chives", "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley", "2 tablespoons broken walnuts", "2 teaspoons dukkah", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 small garlic clove, minced or pureed", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "Salt to taste", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon walnut oil", "Freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Steam asparagus for 3 to 4 minutes (4 if thick, 3 if thin) above 1 inch of boiling water.
