{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Bean Salad With Hot Mustard Dressing", "description": "Hot mustard powder brings a sharp, spicy twist to traditional mustard vinaigrette, which complements sweet green beans well. The beans are blanched until crisp-tender, then tossed in the vinaigrette while still hot. As the beans cool, they absorb all the flavors of mild shallot, fragrant garlic, tangy rice vinegar and hot mustard. Rich, roasted pecans add nutty sweetness to balance the spicy dressing. Though the salad can be made a few hours ahead, you\u2019ll want to top it with the nuts right before serving to preserve their crunch. The beans themselves can be served at room temperature or chilled.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/27/dining/kc-hot-mustard-green-beans/merlin_209008518_21e68c99-adcd-44d7-bc20-c6f05873c4a5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "lunch, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "green beans, mustard powder, pecans, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 325}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons Asian hot mustard powder (or Colman\u2019s dry mustard powder)", "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola", "1/4 cup minced shallot", "2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar", "1 tablespoon minced peeled ginger", "1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon minced garlic", "1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions (from 2 scallions)", "2 pounds green beans, trimmed", "1/4 cup chopped roasted pecans"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, combine mustard powder and 2 tablespoons of very hot water; mix well.
