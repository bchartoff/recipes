{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fresh Egg Pasta", "description": "This adaptable pasta recipe will work with whatever flour you\u2019ve got in the pantry. Using the \u201c00\u201d gives the silkiest, softest pasta while bread flour will give you more of a satisfying chew, and all-purpose lands you squarely in the middle. Because flour absorbs liquid differently depending on its age and the humidity in the air, consider these amounts as a guide and not as the law. Use your judgment. If the dough seems too wet and sticky to work with, add a bit more flour; if it seems too dry to come together into a smooth, satiny ball, add a bit more oil. The pasta is wonderful cooked right away, but you could dry it for future use instead. Let it hang in strands over the backs of your kitchen chairs or on a washing line if you have one. Or you can curl handfuls of pasta into loose nests and let them dry out on the sheet trays, uncovered.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/07/multimedia/clark-pasta/clark-pasta-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings, about 1 pound", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pastas", "keywords": "all-purpose flour, egg, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 538}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 243, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "175 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 cups/290 grams all-purpose flour, bread flour or \u201c00\u201d flour, more as needed", "3/4 teaspoon/3 grams kosher salt", "2 whole large eggs", "3 egg yolks", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, pulse together flour and salt.
