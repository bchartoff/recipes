{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Faloodeh (Persian Lime and Rose Water Granita With Rice Noodles)", "description": "Faloodeh is an ancient Persian dessert, a sort of granita threaded with rice noodles and spiked with rose water and lime. Though you may typically cook noodles until al dente, you\u2019ll need to really cook them through here before adding them to the syrup so that they soak up enough liquid to become as crunchy as possible as they freeze. In Iran, most ice cream shops sell just two items: traditional saffron ice cream and faloodeh, which is typically topped with bottled lime juice that tastes mostly of citric acid. Faloodeh has been my favorite since childhood, but now I prefer it with the juice of freshly squeezed limes. It\u2019s incredibly refreshing and the ideal end to a rich meal filled with complex flavors.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samin Nosrat"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/14Iranianrex10/14Iranianrex10-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "ice creams and sorbets, noodles", "keywords": "dessert, lime juice, rice noodles, rose water, sour cherry, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 44}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup granulated sugar", "Fine sea salt", "1/3 cup lime juice, plus wedges, for serving (about 3 to 4 limes)", "2 tablespoons rose water", "4 ounces very thin rice noodles or rice vermicelli"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan and set over low heat.
