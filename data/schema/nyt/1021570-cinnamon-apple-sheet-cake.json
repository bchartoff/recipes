{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cinnamon Apple Sheet Cake", "description": "This simple cake is studded with large pieces of fruit, so that each slice has its own piece of tender baked apple. Press the apples gently into the batter and be aware that the pound cake-style batter will rise around them. The cake is sweet enough that it needs no frosting, and is finished simply with a dusting of cinnamon-scented confectioners\u2019 sugar that dissolves onto the surface of the apples, leaving only its sweetness behind. Cut the cake into 12 large squares and serve with ice cream, or cut the squares in half for a sweet snack.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/dining/ejm-apple-sheet-cake/merlin_178199946_d5c731e8-327d-4c7d-a503-5ee636ba1423-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "1 (9-by-13-inch) cake (about 12 to 24 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes, dessert", "keywords": "apple, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, eggs, flour, sour cream, sugar, christmas, tailgate, thanksgiving, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 327}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick spray", "3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks)", "1 1/2 cups/330 grams light or dark brown sugar", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "5 large eggs, at room temperature", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters sour cream", "3 medium/540 grams baking apples (such as Honeycrisp, Granny Smith or Pink Lady), peeled, cored and quartered", "1/4 cup/30 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
