{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Maple Pecan Caramel Corn", "description": "Made from a combination of maple syrup and brown sugar, the rich, buttery caramel on this popcorn has a brittle, candy-like crunch that\u2019s heightened by plenty of toasted pecans added alongside. (Cracker Jack fans can substitute roasted, salted peanuts.) A small amount of baking soda keeps the caramel from becoming sticky, but note that you\u2019ll need an instant-read thermometer to yield the best result. If you\u2019d rather use an air popper to prepare your popcorn, you can \u2014 just skip Step 2. The caramel corn will keep in an airtight container for at least a week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/11/dining/06apperex/06apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "About 12 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, candies", "keywords": "dessert, maple syrup, pecans, popcorn", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 655}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or sunflower", "1/3 cup popcorn kernels", "1 cup toasted pecans (see Tip)", "1/2 cup maple syrup", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/3 cup light brown sugar", "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/8 teaspoon baking soda"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 300 degrees, and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat oil\u00a0and 3 popcorn kernels over medium-high with lid on top.
