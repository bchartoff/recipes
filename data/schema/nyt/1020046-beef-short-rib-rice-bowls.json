{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beef Short Rib Rice Bowls", "description": "Inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014547-korean-style-short-ribs\">galbi</a>, or Korean barbecued short ribs, this recipe takes a sharp turn away from the traditional sweet, fruity treatment and instead skews savory, with warm spices like cumin, coriander and turmeric. Meaty short ribs generally require a lengthy cook time, but slice them thinly off the bone and they\u2019ll tenderize quickly when seared on the stovetop\u2014or you could use slivers of skirt steak or hanger steak instead. The skinny strips also have a higher surface area, which means they\u2019ll quickly soak up the flavors of the marinade. Rice is the perfect canvas for the meat, and celery and lettuce balance out the bold flavors with lightness and crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/22/dining/sl-turmeric-short-ribs/merlin_150549891_0b1acbfc-5444-4fbd-954b-5f9e2a02eb77-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H15M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, meat", "keywords": "celery, cilantro, ginger, rice, short ribs, turmeric, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 262}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 1062, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "160 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "34 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "818 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound boneless beef short ribs, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "2 garlic cloves, grated", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "Kosher salt", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "4 cups cooked short-grain rice", "1 small head green leaf lettuce, shredded", "2 stalks celery, thinly sliced\u00a0crosswise", "Fresh cilantro, for serving", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine short ribs, soy sauce, ginger, sugar, garlic, coriander, cumin, turmeric, red-pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon kosher salt in a medium bowl and toss to coat.
