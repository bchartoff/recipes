She often prepares it as a stuffing for chicken; inspired by that, this recipe features a simple citrus-and-soy-spiked chicken sauce to go alongside. Serve it with watercress and steamed white rice, but it also makes great next-day sandwiches.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Francis Lam"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/11/magazine/11eat/11eat-articleLarge-v6.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6-8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "filipino", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "calamansi, Edam cheese, eggs, ham, peas, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 106}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 472, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "sodiumContent": "975 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 large eggs", "1/4 pound Edam cheese, grated", "3/4 cup finely diced smoked ham", "3/4 cup fresh or frozen peas", "1/3 cup raisins", "1/2 medium onion, finely minced", "4 canned Vienna sausages, thoroughly mashed with a fork", "1/3 cup sweet relish", "3 tablespoons ketchup", "1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste", "Black pepper, to taste", "1 1/2 pounds ground pork", "4 1/2 tablespoons calamansi juice (or combine equal parts lime and orange juice with a pinch of orange zest)", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "3 cups best-quality low-sodium chicken broth", "1 tablespoon cornstarch", "3 tablespoons butter, cut in chunks", "1 bunch watercress."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 300.
