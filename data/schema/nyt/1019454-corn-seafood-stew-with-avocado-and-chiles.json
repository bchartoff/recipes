{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Corn-Seafood Stew With Avocado and Chiles", "description": "The bright, tangy flavors of this colorful seafood dish, adapted from the chef Jose Salazar of Mita\u2019s Restaurant in Cincinnati, are loosely based on Mexican pozole verde, a hominy stew usually made with pork or chicken, or both. But here, the starchy grains are replaced by juicy, fresh corn kernels, and seafood stands in for the meat. Perfect for summer, the stew is herbal and light, with a sweetness from the corn that\u2019s balanced by lime juice and roasted tomatillos, while green chiles give the whole thing a kick. You can use any combination of seafood here, adjusting the cooking times as needed.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/15/dining/15apperex1/merlin_142068150_42e87ea0-4876-4fdb-bf40-41e8ac4edf95-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, seafood, soups and stews", "keywords": "jalape\u00f1o, poblano pepper, shrimp, squid, tomatillo, white fish fillet, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 298}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 298, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "37 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "5 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "895 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 medium tomatillos, husked", "2 medium poblano chiles", "1 large jalape\u00f1o", "5 large ears corn, shucked", "1/2 tablespoon grapeseed or olive oil", "4 garlic cloves, sliced", "2 small shallots (or 1 large), halved lengthwise and sliced", "2 packed cups cilantro leaves and stems, plus more leaves for garnish", "1/2 cup packed parsley leaves and stems", "Fine sea salt, as needed", "2 cups vegetable, chicken or seafood stock, preferably homemade", "3/4 pound squid, tentacles separated, bodies cut into 1-inch rings", "3/4 pound shelled shrimp, cut into 1-inch pieces", "1/2 pound firm white fish fillets, cut into 1-inch pieces", "2 limes, cut into wedges", "Diced avocado, for garnish", "Sliced radishes, for garnish", "Shredded green cabbage, for garnish", "Tostadas, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a grill or broiler.
