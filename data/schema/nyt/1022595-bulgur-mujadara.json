{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Bulgur Mujadara", "description": "Mujadara is one of the most popular dishes across the Levant, with a complex taste that belies its simple ingredients. The mix of contrasting tastes \u2014 sweet onions with savory hearty lentils, tender bulgur with crunchy fried onions \u2014 is a feast for the tastebuds. The dish is quite forgiving as there is no right or wrong texture. Some people prefer it fluffy like a pilaf while others prefer it more dense, like sticky rice. This version falls somewhere in the middle. Since lentils and bulgur absorb different amounts of liquid depending on variety, check on them periodically, taste and add water as necessary while cooking. The finished dish is equally delicious warm or at room temperature. It is wholesome on its own, but combined with yogurt and served with a chopped salad, bread and olives, it becomes a most satisfying meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Reem Kassis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/20/dining/15OILREX2-bulgur-mujadara/merlin_196137198_64915b1a-bb3a-426e-b8cd-a4cc99f76c21-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, beans, grains and rice, main course, side dish", "keywords": "bulgur, lentils, onion, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup whole lentils (black, le Puy, brown or green), picked over and rinsed", "1/2 cup olive oil", "3 medium yellow onions, finely diced", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 cup coarse bulgur", "Vegetable oil, for frying", "1 large yellow onion", "1 teaspoon cornstarch"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the mujadara: Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot over high.
