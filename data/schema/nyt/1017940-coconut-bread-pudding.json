{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Bread Pudding", "description": "Laurent Torondel, the chef of BLT Steak and BLT Fish, developed this recipe for tropical bread pudding. It's rich and luxurious, but quite easy to assemble. Thin challah slices are layered on top of one another then drenched with a boozy mix of eggs, sugar, cream and coconut milk. It's baked in a bain-marie, then slid under the broiler for a few minutes to achieve a crackly-brown top.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dana Bowen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/16/dining/16COOKING_COCONUTPUDDING/16COOKING_COCONUTPUDDING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "dessert, nut-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 107}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 614, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "55 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "sodiumContent": "272 milligrams", "sugarContent": "31 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 large eggs", "1 1/8 cups sugar, more for topping dish", "2 cups heavy cream", "1 13 1/2-ounce can coconut milk", "2 tablespoons dark rum", "10 slices challah or brioche, 1/3.-inch thick"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine eggs and 1 1/8 cups sugar.
