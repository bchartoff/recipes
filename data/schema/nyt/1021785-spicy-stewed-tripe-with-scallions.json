{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spicy Stewed Tripe With Scallions", "description": "This spicy, slippery tripe begs to be slurped like a bowl of noodles, so you may want a roll of paper towels nearby. Slicing the tripe as thinly as possible provides a soft, tender texture, and the collagen that yields from the calf\u2019s foot makes the broth itself slick and full-bodied. The mix of chiles creates a great and powerful warmth that spreads across your chest and leaves a bold, pleasant zing on the tongue, but it is not the kind of sharp or angry spicy that makes your eyes water or your nose run. The paper towels are for tidying up around your enthusiasm, not for dabbing your tears.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/17/magazine/17mag-eat/17mag-eat-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT6H", "recipeYield": "2 quarts", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "meat, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "calf's foot, chiles de \u00e1rbol, guajillo chiles, scallion, tripe, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 103}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds honeycomb tripe", "1 medium yellow onion, unpeeled but cut in half horizontally", "1 whole head garlic, unpeeled but cut in half horizontally", "1/2 ounce chiles de \u00e1rbol (about 20 chiles), plus 1 more chile de \u00e1rbol", "1 calf\u2019s foot (about 1 1/2 pounds), split, cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces and well rinsed to remove any grit and blood", "2 quarts broth of any kind (mixed meats, chicken or beef)", "3/4 ounce guajillo chiles (about 3 large)", "1/4 ounce ancho chile (1 chile)", "1 tablespoon dried oregano", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "Kosher salt", "2 big bunches scallions or green onions, cleaned, roots snipped, then sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the stewed tripe: Put tripe in a heavy pot and cover with 1 inch cold water.
