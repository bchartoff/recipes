No food mill or masher is required: Most apples will break down into a thick, glossy mash on their own. The few bits of apple here and there even enhance the texture. Pears work equally well here, but keep in mind that their lower pectin content and acidity levels mean they'll be a touch less jamlike than a batch made with apples.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/07/dining/07JAMGUIDE15/07JAMGUIDE15-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "About 4 to 6 cups (4 to 6 8-ounce jars)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, jams, jellies and preserves", "keywords": "apple, pear, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 50}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 1/2 pounds/2.5 kilograms apples or pears, peeled, cored and cut into 3/4 inch pieces (about 4 pounds/1.8 kilograms cut fruit)", "Add-ins (optional, see note)", "3 cups/600 grams granulated sugar", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters fresh lemon juice (from about 2 lemons)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place a small plate in the refrigerator to chill.
