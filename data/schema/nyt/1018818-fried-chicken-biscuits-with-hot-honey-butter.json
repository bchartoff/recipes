{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Fried Chicken Biscuits With Hot Honey Butter", "description": "This recipe for chicken biscuits could be a weeknight dinner with a side of greens, but it's made to travel, and perfectly suited for a picnic. The biscuit dough, adapted from Sam Sifton's <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013741-all-purpose-biscuits\">all-purpose biscuit recipe</a>, is lightly kneaded here, so it's not too tender to work in a sandwich. The chicken tenders, inspired by Masaharu Morimoto's katsu in the cookbook \"Mastering the Art of Japanese Home Cooking,\" are pounded and coated in panko for plenty of crunch. Prepare both components the day you want to eat them, giving yourself at least one extra hour for everything to cool before you assemble, so the sandwich stays crisp. You can also cook well in advance, and assemble the sandwiches the next day. Either way, cooling the chicken completely, on a wire rack, is crucial. If you prefer breast meat over thigh, feel free to swap it in.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/28/dining/28PICNIC7/28PICNIC7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry, sandwiches", "keywords": "butter, chicken thighs, honey, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 471}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups/450 grams all-purpose flour", "3 tablespoons/37 grams baking powder", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "7 tablespoons/100 grams cold unsalted butter, cubed", "1 1/2 cups/360 milliliters whole milk", "6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "3/4 cup/113 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons cayenne", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "3 eggs", "3 cups/270 grams panko bread crumbs", "Canola or other neutral oil, for frying", "10 tablespoons/142 grams unsalted butter, softened", "3 tablespoons honey", "Hot sauce, a vinegary variety such as Crystal, to taste", "Sliced dill pickles, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the biscuits: In a bowl, use a fork to mix the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.
