{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cranberry-Lemon Eton Mess", "description": "This is not a traditional Eton mess, the renowned British dessert usually comprising meringue, whipped cream and strawberries. I made one like that and loved it, but the elements just begged to be played with. For this, my favorite mess for the fall-into-winter season, I\u2019ve added spice-cookie crumbs to the meringue for more flavor and a bit of surprise, made two add-ins \u2014 a quick-cook cranberry jam and a lemon curd \u2014 and stirred in some fresh raspberries (more tang, more color). Of course, I kept the whipped cream \u2014 it\u2019s essential to a mess. Going with cranberries and curd make this a good choice for the holidays. You can serve the mess family style or in bowls, coupes or even canning jars. And if you want a bit more texture and another flavor, speckle the top with chopped pistachios.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Dorie Greenspan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/11/magazine/11mag-dessert-slide-MVM7/11mag-dessert-slide-MVM7-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H25M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "parfaits and trifles", "keywords": "cranberry, heavy cream, lemon curd, pistachio, raspberries, speculoos, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 134}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 628, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "82 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "34 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "125 milligrams", "sugarContent": "66 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup (100 grams) plus 2 teaspoons sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch", "2 large egg whites, at room temperature", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar or 1/2 teaspoon distilled white vinegar", "Pinch of fine sea salt", "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract", "3 tablespoons spice-cookie crumbs, preferably Biscoff/speculoos", "1 12-ounce (340-gram) bag cranberries (if frozen, don\u2019t defrost)", "3/4 cup (150 grams) sugar", "1/2 cup (120 milliliters) freshly squeezed orange juice (or water)", "1 teaspoon minced, peeled fresh ginger", "About 1 1/2 cups (about 360 milliliters) lemon curd, homemade or store-bought (<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019737-lemon-curd\">see recipe</a>)", "About 3 cups (about 375 grams) raspberries", "1 1/2 cups (360 milliliters) heavy cream, lightly whipped", "Chopped pistachios (optional), for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToSection", "name": "To make the meringue:", "itemListElement": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to 250.
