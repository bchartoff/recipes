{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Eleven Madison Park Granola", "description": "At the end of every meal at the restaurant Eleven Madison Park, in Manhattan, guests are presented with a small gift: a jar of granola for tomorrow\u2019s breakfast. It is classic Alpine fare, taken straight from the chef Daniel Humm\u2019s childhood in Zurich. The rolled oats are golden with brown sugar and a hint of maple, with salt and a wisp of olive oil for depth. Coconut chips and shelled pistachios provide a hint of whimsy, pumpkin seeds a leathery crunch. Dried sour cherries peek out from here and there, bits of softness to complete the whole. Best of all, the recipe is simple and bulletproof for anyone with a rimmed baking sheet and an oven, at least if you're careful with the kosher salt. Opinions vary greatly over the amount we call for: a whole tablespoon. For some, that is many teaspoons too many. (For many others it is absolutely perfect.) Season to taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/27/dining/27GRANOLA/27GRANOLA-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy", "keywords": "main course, maple syrup, nuts, rolled oats, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 2275}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 254, "unsaturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "26 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "139 milligrams", "sugarContent": "12 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 3/4 cups rolled oats", "1 cup shelled pistachios", "1 cup unsweetened coconut chips", "1/3 cup pumpkin seeds", "1 tablespoon kosher salt", "1/2 cup light brown sugar", "1/3 cup maple syrup", "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil", "3/4 cup dried sour cherries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 300.
