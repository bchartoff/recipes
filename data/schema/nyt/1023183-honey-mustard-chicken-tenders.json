{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Honey-Mustard Chicken Tenders", "description": "The combination of honey and mustard has been around since ancient Egypt and Rome, and midcentury American cooks used it in any number of dishes, from baked chicken to glazed ham. But it wasn\u2019t until the 1970s and \u201980s, when restaurants started pairing the zesty sauce with breaded pieces of boneless chicken, that it became wildly popular. As a coating for chicken, honey mustard not only tastes great, but the acidity in the mustard helps keep the meat juicy. For hot honey mustard chicken tenders, add 1/2 teaspoon cayenne to the honey mustard. For an even quicker dinner, do steps 1 and 2 up to a day ahead. (Refrigerate the chicken and store the toasted panko at room temperature.) Eat the tenders dipped into barbecue sauce, hot sauce, ketchup, or \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 more honey mustard.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/10/dining/as-chicken-tenders/merlin_206067894_b7b4e2ba-2053-4721-825e-5d8ddf5d7ba5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, main course", "keywords": "chicken breast, honey, mustard, panko", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 642}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups panko bread crumbs", "1/4 cup neutral oil (such as grapeseed or canola)", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "3 tablespoons honey", "3 tablespoons Dijon mustard", "1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or tenders", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
