{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Korean Meatballs and Noodles", "description": "This kalbi meatball recipe, adapted from the cookbook \u201cKoreatown,\u201d is easy and quick enough to consider for midweek dinner. It offers the sweetly peppered, slightly funky flavors typical of many Korean dishes, and gives new personality to everyday spaghetti and meatballs. My favorite utensil for making ground meat mixtures, by the way, is an old-fashioned potato masher. The book suggests wrapping the meatballs in lettuce, but I tossed them with noodles in a sauce that exploited the brown bits left in the cooking of the meatballs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/23/dining/23PAIRING/23PAIRING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "meatballs", "keywords": "gochujang, ground beef, pear, udon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 657}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 466, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "56 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "1093 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground beef, preferably short rib and chuck", "1 1/2 tablespoons honey", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil", "1 tablespoon rice vinegar", "1/3 cup chopped peeled Bosc or Asian pear", "1/4 cup chopped onion", "1/2 tablespoon grated ginger", "3 tablespoons soy sauce", "2 cloves garlic, minced", "1 large egg, beaten", "1/3 cup dry bread crumbs, preferably whole wheat", "6 ounces udon noodles or linguine", "2 tablespoons gochujang, or ketchup seasoned with 1 teaspoon hot sauce", "3 scallions, trimmed and slant-cut"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 450 degrees.
