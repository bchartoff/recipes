{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Crispy Potato Kugel", "description": "At its core, kugel is a casserole. It comes in both savory and sweet varieties, often made with egg noodles and vaguely sweetened. This version, made with potatoes, is decidedly salty and savory, with onions in the mixture and chives to finish. It can best be described as something between a Spanish tortilla and a giant latke; the potatoes are shredded, not sliced, there are eggs but no flour, and it\u2019s got crispy edges and a creamy interior. Sounds dreamy, doesn\u2019t it? The most annoying parts of this kugel are also the most important: grating the potatoes (I use a box grater, but you can use a food processor with the shredding blade) and wringing out their moisture. For that, I use my hands and a colander or strainer to save a kitchen towel or a cheesecloth, but you can use those, if you like. Traditionally made in a casserole-style baking dish, this kugel starts off in a cast-iron skillet, but a stainless-steel skillet would do the job, and honestly so would a baking dish, just know you may be sacrificing that crunchy underside.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/dining/30Romanrex5-kugel/30Romanrex5-kugel-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "chicken fat, egg, potato, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 269}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 pounds russet potatoes (about 5 to 7 potatoes), peeled\u00a0", "1 large yellow onion", "6 large eggs\u00a0", "10 tablespoons chicken fat, melted, or use vegetable oil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\u00a0", "1/3 cup finely chopped chives, for serving", "Flaky sea salt, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
