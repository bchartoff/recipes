{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Nectarine Tart", "description": "A beautiful dessert made from any great summer fruit \u2014 figs, nectarines, apricots, plums \u2014 that, yes, takes a little time. The reward is in the wow factor you get from the result \u2014 and in the flavors it provides. Brushing the pastry with a slick of good preserves before you add the fruit will create a thick syrup on the bottom that helps keep the pastry from becoming soggy. Then cut the fruit into quarters or eighths, depending on their size, then crowd the wedges so that they stand at attention in tight concentric circles on a pastry shell. Dust the whole thing with sugar and baste the top with melted butter. Cook and cool the finished tart, then serve with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, whipped cream, or a few scoops of your favorite ice cream.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/22/dining/22PIE/22PIE-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, fruit, jelly, pastry crust, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 250}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 330, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "43 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "149 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups flour, plus more for rolling", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "4 tablespoons sugar", "11 tablespoons cold unsalted butter", "1 egg yolk, beaten", "2 1/2-3 pounds fruit like peaches, nectarines, figs, apricots, plums", "6 tablespoons red currant jelly, or other preserves, depending on fruit", "1 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Blend flour, salt and 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl or food processor.
