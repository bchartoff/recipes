It is ground lamb \u2014 shoulder is best \u2014 highly seasoned and grilled rare. Because lamb is the most full-flavored of the everyday meats, it makes a more delicious plain burger than beef. Cooked with nothing but salt, it\u2019s fantastic. Cooked with a variety of spices, as it is here, it\u2019s a game-changer. You can also stuff the burger, as Mr. Tsalbins does on occasion, with smoked mozzarella.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/curry-spiced-lamb-burgers/curry-spiced-lamb-burgers-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 burgers", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, burgers", "keywords": "curry, lamb, onion, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 113}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 469, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "37 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "sodiumContent": "481 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into chunks", "1 medium (or 1/2 large) onion, peeled and cut into chunks", "1 fresh chili, preferably jalape\u00f1o, seeded and minced", "1 teaspoon ground coriander", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon turmeric", "Salt", "freshly ground black pepper to taste", "Diced mango to garnish (optional)", "green and red pepper to garnish (optional)", "red onion to garnish (optional)", "scallion to garnish (optional)", "shredded carrot to garnish (optional)", "shredded lettuce, to garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If grilling or broiling, heat should be medium-high and rack about 4 inches from fire.
