{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cruze Farm Buttermilk Poundcake", "description": "Strictly traditional poundcakes don\u2019t include any leavening \u2013 just one pound each of eggs, sugar, flour, and butter \u2013 which explains why they are often leaden and crumbly. This recipe has a touch of baking soda and a shot of buttermilk, which work together to lighten the crumb and give it moisture and tang. It\u2019s the perfect foil for summer berries and superb plain on its own. Buttermilk you can buy from local dairy farms may not be \u201creal\u201d buttermilk \u2013 which is the leftover liquid from churning cream into butter \u2013 but it will certainly be fresher and richer-tasting than supermarket brands.
