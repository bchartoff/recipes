{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Zucchini With Garlicky Bread Crumbs and Mozzarella", "description": "In this highly zesty recipe, thick slices of zucchini are broiled until golden and tender, then topped with milky mozzarella and bread crumbs flecked with anchovy and garlic. While it bakes, the cheese melts, the crumbs crisp and the whole thing becomes vaguely reminiscent of a lighter parmigiana \u2014 but without the frying. If you\u2019re feeding more than two, this recipe can be doubled. Just make sure to use two rimmed baking pans so the zucchini doesn't overlap and become soggy. If you have Castelvetrano olives, use them here; they add nice crunch and color.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/21/dining/mc-zucchini-planks/mc-zucchini-planks-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, weeknight, vegetables", "keywords": "anchovies, basil, olives, panko, parmesan, zucchini, fall, summer, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 477}, "recipeIngredient": ["Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed", "4 medium zucchini, sliced lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick planks", "Fine sea salt", "1/2 cup panko bread crumbs", "1/2 cup grated Parmesan", "4 anchovy fillets, minced", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or mashed to a paste", "1/2 teaspoon herbes de Provence or dried oregano", "Pinch of red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving", "4 ounces mozzarella, grated (about 1 cup)", "Black pepper", "3 tablespoons chopped, pitted black or green olives", "2 tablespoons torn basil or parsley leaves", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat broiler.
