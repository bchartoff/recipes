She was one of a band of cooks, mostly women, stretching back over generations, who have formed Italian cuisine, maintained its traditions and made it one of the world's most beloved and sought-after cooking styles. Italians sometimes call it \"cucina casalinga,\" roughly translated as \"housewives' cooking.\" But with its intense concern for the quality of primary ingredients and its care to combine them in a judicious balance of flavors, it is much more than that. Use the best ingredients you can find. Then let the simplicity of the preparations work its magic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nancy Harmon Jenkins"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/29/dining/roman-lamb/roman-lamb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, roasts, times classics", "keywords": "anchovy fillets, dry white wine, lamb, wine vinegar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 104}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/4 pounds young lamb, the leg or shoulder, bone in, cut into eight chunks", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "4 cloves garlic", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste", "1 tablespoon instant flour, like Wondra", "3/4 cup dry white wine", "1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves", "4 oil-packed anchovy filets, coarsely chopped", "3 tablespoons wine vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse the lamb chunks under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a casserole or roasting pan large enough to hold all pieces of lamb, heat olive oil over medium-high to high heat.
