It rewards close attention to weight rather than volume in the matter of the ingredients, and asks for a mixture of finely ground Italian pizza flour (designated \u201c00\u201d on the bags and available in some supermarkets, many specialty groceries and always online) and regular all-purpose flour. As ever with breads, rise time will depend on the temperature and humidity of your kitchen and refrigerator.\n\n<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/807163-our-greatest-pizza-recipes\">Our Greatest Pizza Recipes</a>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/18/dining/pizzadough-2/pizzadough-2-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "Two 12-inch pizzas", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 5167}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 518, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "104 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "324 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["153 grams 00 flour (1 cup plus 1 tablespoon)", "153 grams all-purpose flour (1 cup plus 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons)", "8 grams fine sea salt (1 teaspoon)", "2 grams active dry yeast (3/4 teaspoon)", "4 grams extra-virgin olive oil (1 teaspoon)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams (a little less than 1 cup) lukewarm tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour mixture.
