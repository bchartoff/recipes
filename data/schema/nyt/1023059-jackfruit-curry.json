There, meats are heavily seasoned, then set atop tubers, jackfruit or breadfruit, wrapped in banana leaves and slow-cooked. This simple vegan dish is rich and satisfying, drawing on the Indo-Fijian flavors of the island, with aromatic spices and a bit of a kick. Heavy with coriander, garlic and ginger, this spice blend has a slightly milder, more delicate flavor than most. But if you have a favorite blend, you can substitute the spices in this recipe with 2 tablespoons of no-salt curry powder, and continue with the recipe as written.
