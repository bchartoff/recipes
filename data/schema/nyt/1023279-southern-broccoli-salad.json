{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Southern Broccoli Salad", "description": "A classic sweet and savory Southern broccoli salad combines raw (or barely cooked) broccoli with sweet dried fruit (typically raisins or cranberries), crunchy sunflower seeds and savory Cheddar in a creamy, tangy mayonnaise dressing. Briefly blanching the broccoli in boiling water ensures bright green veggies with a crisp-tender texture. The salad gets better with time, so make it a few hours ahead and refrigerate it. (Reserve the crispy bacon and sprinkle it on top right before serving.) And, if your tastes skew sweet, further increase the sugar by another tablespoon.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/27/dining/kc-southern-broccoli-salad/merlin_209008629_c696a0a2-2550-4c65-b88c-ca2f9b5a1e2f-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, side dish", "keywords": "broccoli florets, cheddar, golden raisins, mayonnaise, sunflower seeds", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 221}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and pepper", "8 ounces bacon (any type)\u00a0", "10 cups (1 1/2 pounds) 1- to 1\u00bd-inch broccoli florets\u00a0", "1 cup mayonnaise", "1/4 cup finely chopped red onion", "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "1 tablespoon granulated sugar\u00a0", "1 cup coarsely grated Cheddar\u00a0", "1/2 cup golden raisins", "1/2 cup roasted, salted sunflower seeds"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium.
