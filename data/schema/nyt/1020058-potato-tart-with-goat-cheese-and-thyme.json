{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Potato Tart With Goat Cheese and Thyme", "description": "Store-bought puff pastry is the true workhorse in this elegant recipe, which involves three basic components: puff pastry, cheese and potatoes. When cooking with limited ingredients, quality is key, so use puff pastry made with real butter if you can get it \u2014 the flavor is better and the puff is, simply put, puffier. The dough is formed by a process called \u201clamination\u201d in which alternating layers of butter and dough are folded together. As it bakes, the butter creates steam between the layers, providing the puff. Be sure to use the tines of a fork to \u201cdock\u201d the dough before baking; this creates little chutes for steam to escape instead of getting trapped and forming unsightly bubbles. Master the puff pastry part and this tart is easy and versatile: Play around with various spices and top with any fresh herbs you have on hand.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/25/dining/sl-potato-tart/merlin_150673014_e3e876d1-e6a4-4e91-95ca-612830df0ce0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, pies and tarts", "keywords": "goat cheese, potato, puff pastry, ricotta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 308}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 419, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "34 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "27 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "353 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["All-purpose flour, for dusting", "1 (14-ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed", "1 pound baby potatoes, preferably in different colors", "8 ounces fresh ricotta", "1 (4-ounce) log firm goat cheese", "2 teaspoons smoked paprika", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted", "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
