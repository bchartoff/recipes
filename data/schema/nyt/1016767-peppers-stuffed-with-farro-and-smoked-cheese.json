{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Peppers Stuffed with Farro and Smoked Cheese", "description": "This dish combines smoky-flavored cheese and paprika  with the crunch of the farro and walnuts. Simmer the farro or spelt until it splays.\n\nI was inspired to make this filling by a delicious stuffed tomato dish I ate recently at Oliveto in Oakland, Calif., in which the tomatoes were stuffed with a smoky barley filling. I used a Dutch smoked gouda-like cheese that was labeled, simply \u201csmoked cheese.\u201d I added paprika to the mix, which contributes to the smoky flavor, and walnuts, because I love the crunchiness with the grains. The cooked farro or spelt should be soft, so make sure to simmer until the grains splay.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/26/science/28recipehealth/28recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, vegetables", "keywords": "bell pepper, farro, gouda cheese, paprika, tomato, fall, summer, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, vegetarian, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 152}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 245, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "12 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "666 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups cooked farro or spelt", "3 ounces smoked cheese, such as smoked gouda, cut in very small dice", "1/4 cup chopped walnuts (1.5 ounces)", "1/2 pound fresh, ripe tomatoes, grated", "1 teaspoon sweet paprika, and  additional for sprinkling", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "6 medium-size or smallish bell peppers, any color (1 1/2 to 2 pounds)", "1/2 cup water", "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon tomato paste", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
