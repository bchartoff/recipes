{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pasta With Fresh Tomato Sauce", "description": "I have been cooking a version of this dish practically since I first encountered \nit in a \u201c60-Minute Gourmet\u201d column, the brainchild of the late Pierre Franey, in \nJanuary 1986. Why Pierre published the recipe in mid-winter is a mystery. To make the sauce my way you chop tomatoes; you put them in fat, whether that\u2019s olive oil, butter or, I suppose, rendered bacon fat; you cook them until they\u2019ve broken down a bit and given up their liquid; and you dress pasta with the resulting sauce. (Pierre peeled the tomatoes first, because that was his style. He was a chef!) With good tomatoes, you can make this sauce in its most basic form \u2014 with no more than tomato, oil and salt \u2014 and it will be terrific. But you can jazz it up in a variety of ways; butter in place of oil changes its character noticeably. Parmesan is an obvious and welcome addition. Cooking a bit of chopped onion or minced garlic in the butter or oil \u2014 with or without rosemary, tarragon or thyme \u2014 before adding the tomatoes adds depth. Chopped basil at the end ... well, to me this is practically essential.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": null, "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, pastas", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, pasta, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 63}, "recipeIngredient": ["Salt", "3 to 5 tablespoons butter or olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, roughly chopped", "1 pound linguine or other long pasta", "1/2 cup shredded fresh basil leaves, if desired", "Freshly grated Parmesan, if desired"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it.
