{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ka\u2019ak el Eid", "description": "People all across the Arab world make some version of date-stuffed semolina cookies to celebrate both Muslim and Christian holidays. The recipes vary from country to country, even from family to family, as do the spicing, stuffing and cooking methods. But wherever you go, if you are served one of these cookies, you know it\u2019s a call for celebration. This recipe is a Palestinian version in which the dough is fragrant from anise, fennel and nigella seeds. The cookies are also shaped into rings, making them easier to prepare than the ones made with molds or decorated with serrated edge tweezers. While they still require some effort, they keep quite well in an airtight container for several weeks and can be frozen for several months. One bite into the crispy, spiced crust with a soft date interior will make you understand just why they are worth the effort.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Reem Kassis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/14/dining/14EID-KA-Ak-El-a/merlin_190126692_87e5ca05-9a43-4725-b430-6f3e2b814250-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT9H45M", "recipeYield": "About 35 round cookies", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "cinnamon, cookie, dates, freezer friendly, make-ahead, semolina flour", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 58}, "recipeIngredient": ["A scant 1 1/2 cups/250 grams semolina flour\u00a0", "2 cups/250 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons/125 grams softened unsalted butter", "1/2 cup vegetable oil", "1 tablespoon nigella seeds (or unhulled sesame seeds)", "1 tablespoon ground aniseed", "1 tablespoon ground fennel seeds", "1 teaspoon baking powder", "1 teaspoon instant yeast", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 cup warm water, plus more if needed", "Vegetable or olive oil, as needed for greasing", "1 pound/450 grams date paste (see Tip)", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, combine the semolina flour, all-purpose flour, butter and oil.
