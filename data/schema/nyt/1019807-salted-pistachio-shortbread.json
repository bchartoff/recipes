{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salted Pistachio Shortbread", "description": "This is one of those rare doughs that\u2019s better when made in a food processor. Dense, buttery, salty and nutty, the cookies call for pistachios, but swap in walnuts, pecans or hazelnuts, if you prefer. One thing to note: These cookies are best sliced after baking, not before. Fresh out of the oven, the cookie is very tender and easy to cut. Do it almost immediately, as the baked cookie hardens quickly. The result is an extremely pleasing arrangement of crisp-edged triangles that may look just a little like a Danish modernist interpretation of a Christmas tree.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alison Roman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/05/dining/05slice5/05slice5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "24 wedges", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "confectioners' sugar, pistachio, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 345}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/95 grams shelled, raw pistachios, almonds, hazelnuts or walnuts", "1/3 cup/40 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more for dusting (optional)", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick)", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "3/4 cups/95 grams all-purpose flour", "Nonstick spray or softened butter, for greasing", "Flaky salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Process pistachios in a food processor until finely ground.
