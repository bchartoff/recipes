{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Middle Eastern-Inspired Herb and Garlic Chicken", "description": "This recipe was inspired by the Middle Eastern dried seasoning mix called za\u2019atar, a combination of herbs (usually thyme, oregano and marjoram), sesame seeds and sumac, often spiked with salt. Here, fresh herbs are substituted for the dried, which, along with fresh parsley and mint and plenty of lemon and garlic, are used to marinated boneless chicken thighs. If you can\u2019t find sumac, just leave it out. It does add a nice tang and vibrant color, but the dish will work without it. Optimum marinating time here is 8 hours. But feel free to leave it for as little as 15 minutes or as long as 24 hours. If you would rather use white meat, substitute boneless skinless breasts but reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/25/dining/Middle-eastern-chicken/merlin_110758297_fe348e57-5a1d-4920-a9a7-9c8a5d8e60b0-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "weekday, weeknight", "keywords": "chicken thigh, Greek yogurt, sumac, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1982}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 187, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "17 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "447 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 1 3/4 pounds)", "6 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane or minced", "Juice and zest of 2 lemons", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for serving", "2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, more for serving", "2 tablespoons minced fresh mint", "1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme", "1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano or marjoram", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed", "1 tablespoon sesame seeds, more for garnish (optional)", "3/4 teaspoon sumac, more for garnish (optional)", "2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt, preferably whole milk yogurt", "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine chicken with all but 1 teaspoon of the grated garlic (save that teaspoon for the yogurt sauce), the zest and juice of 1 lemon, oil, parsley, mint, thyme, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and the\u00a0sesame seeds and sumac, if using.
