{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Edna Lewis\u2019s Peach Cobbler", "description": "This delicious cobbler, which was featured in a Times article about fruit desserts, is designed to let the incandescent flavor of summer peaches shine, and it\u2019s best made when they are in season. Edna Lewis, the careful cook from Virginia whose books are considered definitive in the Southern culinary canon, often suggested a lattice top for it, with bits of raw dough tucked into the filling before baking. Serve the result warm with ice cream or whipped cream, or all by itself.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20HIT_PEACHCOBBLER/20HIT_PEACHCOBBLER-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "southern", "recipeCategory": "editors' pick", "keywords": "dessert, peach", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 295}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 582, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "68 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "sodiumContent": "431 milligrams", "sugarContent": "32 grams", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 cups sifted all-purpose flour (345 grams)", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and frozen for 10 minutes", "2 tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening, frozen for 10 minutes and cut into small pieces", "1 to 2 teaspoons granulated sugar, for sprinkling on top crust, optional", "8 cups firm but ripe peeled, sliced peaches", "3/4 cup granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pastry: Set aside a small bowl of ice water.
