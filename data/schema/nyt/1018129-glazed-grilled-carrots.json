{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Glazed Grilled Carrots", "description": "These glazed carrots, from Karen and Quinn Hatfield of the Los Angeles restaurant Odys and Penelope, are caramelized and sweetened from a quick hot turn on the grill, then tossed in a salty dressing of soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, garlic and ginger. Turning the carrots often and moving them around on the grill keeps them from burning. And if your carrots are burning but aren't yet cooked through, transfer them to a baking sheet and finish cooking in a 400-degree oven.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jeff Gordinier"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/dining/25CHEF7/25CHEF7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "vegetables", "keywords": "balsamic vinegar, carrot, ginger, soy sauce, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, side dish, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 359}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 144, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "19 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "7 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "415 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "1 tablespoon soy sauce", "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary", "1/2 clove garlic, cut into paper-thin slices", "1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for the carrots", "10 medium carrots, peeled, trimmed and cut in half lengthwise", "Salt", "1 green onion, thinly sliced"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, rosemary, garlic and ginger until combined.
