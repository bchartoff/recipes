{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche Pasta With Peas and Scallions", "description": "Here\u2019s an easy weeknight pasta featuring cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, the richer, slightly less tangy cousin of sour cream. It\u2019s combined with Parmesan, lemon zest and starchy pasta cooking water for a sauce that is creamy, velvety and bright. Whole bunches of scallions caramelize until their edges char, lending sweetness and a hint of smoke, while raw scallions add color as a garnish. To preserve the brightness of the peas, throw them in the pasta cooking water at the very end and drain along with the shells. Plan appropriately, and the sauce and scallions can be prepared in the time it takes the pasta to cook.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hana Asbrink"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/06/dining/ha-pea-pasta/merlin_190126602_9b091437-c03f-47f1-a7e5-b1d5dcef9c47-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, pastas, main course", "keywords": "cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, parmesan, pasta, scallion", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1348}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 bunches scallions (about 12 ounces)", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "1 pound medium shells pasta", "1 cup finely grated Parmesan", "3/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1 lemon, zested (about 2 teaspoons zest), then quartered", "1 cup frozen peas"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim the scallions.
