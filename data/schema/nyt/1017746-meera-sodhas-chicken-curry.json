{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Meera Sodha\u2019s Chicken Curry", "description": "This simple curry serves as a fine introduction to the Indian home cooking of Meera Sodha, a British cookbook author whose \u201cMade in India: Recipes From an Indian Family Kitchen\u201d was released in 2015. The recipe for this curry, her \"ultimate comfort food,'' derives from the one her Indian-born mother cooked for Sodha when she was growing up in Lincolnshire and for which she pined for during her college years in London. It provides a thick, gingery, garlic-flecked tomato sauce with deep notes of cinnamon and cumin, and a low flame of chile heat, surrounding small chunks of skinless chicken thigh, with slivered almonds scattered over the top at the end. If you\u2019ve ever cooked a rag\u00f9 for spaghetti, or made a beef stew, you\u2019ll have no problem making it at all. Only the spices are different.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/magazine/18eat1/18mag-18eat-t_CA1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "weeknight", "keywords": "chicken, curry, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1952}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 694, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "20 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "50 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "41 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "1008 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, like canola", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds", "2 cinnamon sticks, approximately 2 inches long", "2 large white or yellow onions, peeled and finely chopped", "1 2 1/2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and grated or minced", "6 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed", "2 green cayenne or jalape\u00f1o peppers, stemmed, seeded and cut into half-moons", "Kosher salt, to taste", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons pur\u00e9ed tomatoes", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric", "3 tablespoons whole-milk yogurt, plus 1 cup to serve with the meal", "1 3/4 to 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks", "3 tablespoons slivered almonds", "1 teaspoon garam masala", "Pinch ground cayenne pepper, or to taste."], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt the butter or ghee in the oil in a large Dutch oven set over medium heat, and when it is hot and shimmering, add the cumin seeds and cinnamon sticks.
