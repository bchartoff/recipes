{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pistachio Bundt Cake", "description": "If you\u2019ve never been a fan of Bundt cake, this one just might change your mind. The key to this cake\u2019s moist crumb and sweet, nostalgic flavor is instant pistachio pudding mix, a trick that the chef Joshua Pinsky learned from his mother. A simple lime glaze and whipped ricotta for dolloping make this recipe feel more special than your average snacking cake. This also works well as a make-ahead dessert, retaining its moisture and flavor over a few days. Try making the whipped ricotta a day ahead: It\u2019ll thicken and become even creamier overnight.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna and Jesse Szewczyk"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/18/multimedia/18PUDDING-REX1-pistachio-bundt-cake-ckmf/18PUDDING-REX1-pistachio-bundt-cake-ckmf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H35M", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, dessert", "keywords": "bundt cake, confectioners' sugar, egg white, greek yogurt, heavy cream, lime juice, make-ahead, pistachio, ricotta, vanilla bean paste", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 621}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray or neutral oil", "2 3/4 cups/351 grams all-purpose flour", "1 (3.4-ounce) package instant pistachio pudding mix", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon baking powder", "3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon/195 milliliters whole milk", "3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/205 grams full-fat plain Greek yogurt", "1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract", "9 large egg whites", "1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "2 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons/528 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/4 cups/300 milliliters canola oil", "2/3 cup/85 grams shelled pistachios, coarsely chopped", "1 1/3 cup/328 grams whole-milk ricotta", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters heavy whipping cream", "2/3 cup/68 grams sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract", "2 teaspoons olive oil", "Pinch of kosher salt", "2 1/4 cups/230 grams sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters fresh lime juice (from about 2 medium limes), plus more as needed", "1/2 cup/64 grams unsalted roasted shelled pistachios, sliced or coarsely chopped", "Flaky sea salt, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees and coat a 12-cup (or larger) Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, pistachio pudding mix and baking powder.
