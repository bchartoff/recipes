{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salsa Macha", "description": "Salsa macha is a rich chile oil from Veracruz, Mexico, made from variations of dried chiles, garlic, nuts and seeds fried in oil and finely chopped. As a condiment it\u2019s easy to make, and stores well. It\u2019s also incredibly versatile, adding texture and depth to everything it touches, from tacos and fried potatoes to poached eggs or a simple bowl of noodles with herbs. Once you\u2019ve made it once, feel free to adjust the ingredients to suit your taste, playing with the chile varieties, or swapping in different seeds or nuts.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/20/magazine/20mag-eat/20mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 3 cups", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "ancho chili, chiles de \u00e1rbol, grapeseed oil, peanut, sesame seeds, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 373}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups grapeseed oil", "8 dried ancho chiles, stems and seeds removed", "4 dried morita chiles, stems and seeds removed", "2 dried chiles de \u00e1rbol, stems and seeds removed", "6 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced", "2/3 cup roasted peanuts", "2 tablespoons white sesame seeds", "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar, white wine vinegar or white vinegar", "1 teaspoon light brown sugar", "Sea salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium.
