{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Plum Graham Cracker Crumble", "description": "As plums bake, their tartness mellows and their juices jelly \u2014 just a couple reasons why they do so well in pies, cobblers and this crumble, which is essentially an upside-down graham cracker-crusted pie. If you don\u2019t have graham crackers on hand, vanilla wafers will work nicely too, but you\u2019ll need to cook a little longer. Be sure to press the graham crackers into a single layer instead of scattering clumps of it over the plums; doing so creates a sturdy but delicate topping that won\u2019t drown in a sea of plum juice. Keep this plum crumble simple, or add extra spices like ground ginger, cinnamon or nutmeg.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jerrelle Guy"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/10/dining/jg-plum-graham-cracker-crumble/merlin_175303665_cd215843-c9ab-4906-bf48-eb69a94df787-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "butter, graham cracker, plum, fall, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 794}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound/450 grams black plums (about 4 large plums), pitted and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 1/2 cups)", "5 tablespoons/55 grams packed brown sugar", "1/4 cup/35 grams plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 sleeve (9 sheets)/145 grams graham crackers, crushed into fine crumbs using a food processor or in a resealable bag using a rolling pin", "6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick), melted", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.\u00a0To an 8-inch square (or round) baking dish, add the plums, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 tablespoon flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
