{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Indonesian Chicken Curry (Opor Ayam)", "description": "This luxurious chicken stew from Java is a staple of the Indonesian kitchen, made by simmering the meat in coconut milk with curry paste and lemongrass. The chef Retno Pratiwi grew up eating the dish on special occasions in West Java, and continues to make it at her pop-up restaurant in Boston, always opting for drumsticks over white meat. Though the shallots are traditionally incorporated raw into the curry paste, Pratiwi prefers to caramelize them first to bring out their sweetness. It adds a little time to the process, but the final result is worth it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/06/dining/06EIDjp4/06EIDjp4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indonesian", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "candlenut, coconut milk, galangal, lemongrass, makrut lime leaf, salam leaf, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 765, "unsaturatedFatContent": "25 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "48 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "1017 milligrams", "sugarContent": "7 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup coriander seeds", "3 tablespoons coconut oil", "10 small shallots, sliced", "Kosher salt, to taste", "15 garlic cloves", "5 candlenuts (or 5 to 10 macadamia nuts)", "2 to 3 1-inch pieces kaempferia galanga root, peeled (optional)", "1/2 tablespoon white peppercorns", "1 3-inch piece ginger, peeled and lightly smashed to loosen the fibers", "1 3-inch piece galangal, peeled and lightly smashed to loosen the fibers", "5 lemongrass stalks, trimmed, smashed and tied into knots", "10 to 15 fresh or dried salam leaves (Indonesian bay leaves)", "20 fresh makrut (kaffir) lime leaves", "1 tomato, chopped (or 1 cup cherry tomatoes)", "1 8.5-ounce can coconut milk", "3/4 cup chicken stock", "3 pounds bone-in chicken pieces"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a dry skillet over medium-high heat, toast the coriander seeds for 2 to 3 minutes.
