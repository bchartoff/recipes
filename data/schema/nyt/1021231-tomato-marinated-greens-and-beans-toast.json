{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tomato-Marinated Greens and Beans Toast", "description": "This fresh, no-cook dish makes the most out of tomatoes by grating the flesh, which preserves all of the sweet juices and raw pulp. The natural acidity in the tomato juice, combined with capers and vinegar, create a piquant sauce that tenderizes and subdues sturdy greens. Earthy Swiss chard is used here, but other leafy greens like lacinato kale would work, as would spicy mustard greens. The lentils add a meaty bite, but red kidney beans or chickpeas would also work. Refrigerate leftovers and serve over eggs, tossed with warm pasta or as a sauce for roasted chicken or fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/10/dining/kc-tomato-marinated-beans-and-greens/merlin_174838692_ea4e514f-14ed-45c5-a400-a2b3b00252f5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, easy, lunch, snack, weeknight, salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "bread, lentils, olive oil, parmesan, shallot, swiss chard, toast, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 516}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ripe heirloom or beefsteak tomatoes (about 2 large tomatoes), halved crosswise", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons drained capers, plus 1 tablespoon caper brine", "2 tablespoons minced shallot", "2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1/8 teaspoon grated garlic", "4 ounces Swiss chard, stems separated and thinly sliced, leaves stacked and cut into 1/4-inch-thick ribbons", "8 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, halved", "1 (14-ounce) can lentils, rinsed and drained", "4 thick toast slices", "Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Working over a large bowl, grate flesh side tomatoes on the large holes of a box grater until all that\u2019s left is the tomato skin; discard skin.
