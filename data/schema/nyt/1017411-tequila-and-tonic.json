{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Tequila and Tonic", "description": "Ivy Mix, an owner of Leyenda, a Brooklyn bar with a focus on Latin spirits, thinks this drink requires an earthy lowland tequila (that is, grown in the valley section of Jalisco), such at the Partida reposado, which is aged slightly, and has toasty, nutty flavors. For its tonic match, she reaches for Canada Dry or Schweppes, which have \u201cmore quinine kick\u201d in her opinion. For a switch, try this recipe with mezcal. But, since that smoky spirit is typically more pungent in flavor, use only an ounce and a half.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Robert Simonson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20TEQUILA/20TEQUILA-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2M", "recipeYield": "1 drink", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "for one", "keywords": "summer, tequila, tonic water", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 72}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 172, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "0 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "14 milligrams", "sugarContent": "10 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["Lime wedge (one sixth of a lime)", "2 ounces tequila, preferably Partida reposado", "4 ounces tonic water, preferably Canada Dry or Schweppes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a highball glass with ice.
