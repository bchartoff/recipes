{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Saag Paneer", "description": "Saag refers to an Indian vegetable dish in which spinach or other dark greens are stewed with ginger, garlic, fresh chiles and spices until meltingly soft. As the name suggests, saag paneer includes paneer, a mild Indian cheese that is firm enough to cook without melting. The heat of the serrano chiles balances the creamy richness, but for a milder dish, remove the seeds before mincing the chiles. The fresh greens are finely chopped before cooking, to help them break down faster into a silky gravy. Thawed chopped frozen spinach can be used to save time, but make sure to drain well and squeeze out the excess liquid first. Finish the dish with a little heavy cream (or plain yogurt) to lend body and richness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/09/dining/kc-saag-paneer/merlin_184703130_333fde92-9fe6-489d-87fb-eb1617e82395-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "indian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "baby spinach, ghee, ginger, heavy cream, rice, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2214}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound fresh baby spinach (about 8 packed cups)", "2 tablespoons ghee", "8 ounces paneer, cut into 1-by-1/2-inch pieces", "1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 tablespoon freshly grated peeled ginger (from a 2-inch piece)", "2 teaspoons grated garlic (from about 3 cloves)", "1 serrano chile, stemmed and minced", "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander", "1/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "Steamed rice and Indian flatbread, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, working in batches, pulse spinach until minced but not pur\u00e9ed.
