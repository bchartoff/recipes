{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Thighs With Cumin, Cayenne and Citrus", "description": "Chicken thighs have a huge advantage over lean breasts. The skin browns nicely and the meat stays juicy even when thoroughly cooked, which makes them ideal for grilling or broiling. The dark, rich meat also responds brilliantly to the strong equatorial flavors often associated with grilling. The Mexican-inspired treatment here, a quick liquid rub for the thighs, packs plenty of punch, even if you use just a little cayenne. What makes it evoke Mexico is the combination of two characteristic spices, cumin and oregano, with a mixture of orange and lime juices to simulate the sour orange that is used in the Yucat\u00e1n but is rarely seen in this country.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/20/dining/20COOKING-MEXCHICTHIGHS1/20COOKING-MEXCHICTHIGHS1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, weeknight", "keywords": "boneless chicken thighs, garlic, lime juice, orange juice, oregano, poultry, spices, low-fat, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 789}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 416, "unsaturatedFatContent": "19 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "30 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "492 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cloves garlic, peeled", "1 small onion, quartered", "1 tablespoon fresh oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried", "2 teaspoons ground cumin", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste", "Pinch ground cloves", "Salt and pepper", "1 tablespoon peanut or other oil", "2 tablespoons orange juice, preferably freshly squeezed", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice", "About 1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken thighs, or 2 pounds thighs with bones", "Chopped cilantro for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat a gas grill, start a wood or charcoal fire or preheat a broiler; the fire should be moderately hot, and the rack should be about 4 inches from the heat source."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the garlic, onion, oregano, cumin, cayenne, cloves, salt, pepper and oil in a blender or small food processor, and blend until fairly smooth.
