Inspired by the classic cake, this bread pudding transforms those three milks into a rich custard that gets absorbed by buttery cubes of brioche. As it bakes in a water bath, it becomes golden and toasty on the top and soft and pillowy on the bottom. Serve it at any temperature with a dollop of whipped cream and a drizzle of condensed milk. If you have any leftovers, eat them for breakfast topped with a little Greek yogurt and some fresh fruit.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/dining/ss-tres-leches-pudding/ss-tres-leches-pudding-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings", "keywords": "brioche, condensed milk, evaporated milk, heavy cream, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 263}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 489, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "40 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "31 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "353 milligrams", "sugarContent": "24 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter, for greasing the baking dish", "3 large eggs", "4 large egg yolks", "2 cups/480 milliliters heavy cream", "1 cup/240 milliliters condensed milk", "1 cup/240 milliliters whole milk", "1 (12-ounce/360-milliliters) can evaporated milk", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "12 ounces/340 grams brioche, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes (about 8 cups)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
