It calls for just four ingredients \u2013 heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, grated chocolate and egg whites \u2013 and it's dead simple to make. Just whip the cream, add the sugar, fold in the beaten egg whites and chocolate, and then freeze. Unmold, slice and serve. To gild the lily, garnish with fresh summer berries.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/06/dining/06SEMIFREDDO/06SEMIFREDDO-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dessert, egg whites, heavy cream, semisweet chocolate, raw, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 269}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 294, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "24 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "47 milligrams", "sugarContent": "14 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups very cold heavy cream", "1 1/4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar", "4 ounces very finely grated semi sweet baking chocolate", "6 egg whites"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Whip the cream.
