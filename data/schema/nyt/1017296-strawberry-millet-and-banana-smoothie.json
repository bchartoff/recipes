{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry, Millet and Banana Smoothie", "description": "Whenever you find sweet, ripe strawberries buy twice what you need and hull and freeze half of them. I freeze them in small freezer bags, one smoothie portion per bag. You can also use commercial frozen strawberries for this nourishing mix of fruit, millet, cashews and kefir. I have gotten into the habit of soaking a small amount of cashews and almonds in water and keeping them in the refrigerator to use in smoothies. For a vegan version substitute almond milk for the kefir, and if you can\u2019t find plain kefir, use yogurt or buttermilk.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/17/science/recipehealthstrawberry/recipehealthstrawberry-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "1 large or 2 small servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, lunch, snack, non-alcoholic drinks", "keywords": "fall, spring, summer, winter, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, vegan, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 25}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 420, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "67 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "13 grams", "fiberContent": "7 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "120 milligrams", "sugarContent": "39 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup, tightly packed, cooked millet", "1 cup / 6 ounces hulled strawberries, preferably frozen", "1 small ripe banana", "1 cup plain kefir", "1 tablespoon soaked cashews (soaked for several hours or overnight in water)", "1 teaspoon pomegranate molasses", "1 or 2 ice cubes if not using frozen strawberries"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place all of the ingredients in the jar of a blender and blend at high speed until smooth.
