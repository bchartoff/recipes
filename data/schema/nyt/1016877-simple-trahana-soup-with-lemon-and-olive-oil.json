{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Simple Trahana Soup With Lemon and Olive Oil", "description": "This is just about the simplest dish to make with trahana, yet I find it incredibly satisfying and refreshing. I like it both hot and cold; it is cooling on a hot summer day and comforting on a cool one (we were in the middle of a bad heat wave when I was testing this week\u2019s recipes). The soup is adapted from a recipe in Diane Kochilas\u2019s new cookbook: \u201cIkaria: Lessons on Food, Life, and Longevity From the Greek Island Where People Forget to Die.\u201d My favorite herb to use with the soup is fresh dill. If you want to add more ingredients, simmer vegetables of your choice in the broth, or add blanched or steamed vegetables to the soup when you serve it. Broccoli would be great, as would peas, beans, or sugar snap peas.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/21/science/21recipehealthlemon/21recipehealthlemon-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "Serves 6", "recipeCuisine": "greek, mediterranean, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, fall, spring, summer, winter, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 26}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 224, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "11 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "887 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016876-homemade-sour-bulgur-trahana-from-ikaria\">1 1/2 cups sour bulgur trahana</a>", "8 cups water, vegetable stock, or chicken stock", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "3 tablespoons lemon juice, strained", "6 tablespoons crumbled feta", "Plain Greek yogurt for garnish (optional)", "Chopped fresh herbs for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium soup pot heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat and add  trahana.
