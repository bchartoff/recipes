{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Russian Salad", "description": "Basically a vegetable-studded potato salad with mayonnaise, Russian salad is hugely popular all over the world for family gatherings and festive events. It\u2019s a beloved, traditional party dish riffed on almost everywhere but my own home: I\u2019d only ever seen pasty, congealed versions I would never wish to eat until I tried this one from Vladimir Ocokoljic, served at his Serbian restaurant Kafana in New York City. While not quite as demanding as his aunt back in Belgrade, who used to slice even the peas in half, Mr. Ocokoljic insists on the tiny dice (each ingredient should match the size of a pea) and emphatically dislikes any sweet pickles (only gherkins or cornichons are a fit), making the finished dish delicate, luscious and savory. Whisking pickle brine into the mayonnaise creates a liquidy slurry, loose enough to dress the salad without its becoming smushed and gluey.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Gabrielle Hamilton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/14/magazine/14mag-eat/14mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "6 1/2 cups (about 12 servings)", "recipeCuisine": "russian", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "carrot, cornichons, egg, frozen peas, mayonnaise, potato", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 556}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 medium yellow potatoes (about 1 pound), washed", "5 thin carrots (about 1/2 pound), washed", "10 ounces frozen peas", "4 large eggs, fridge-cold", "3 1/2 ounces boiled ham", "1 cup drained cornichons and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of their brine", "1 scant cup Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of water to boil.
