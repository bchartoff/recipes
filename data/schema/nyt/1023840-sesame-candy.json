{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sesame Candy", "description": "This sesame candy is a traditional Chinese candy that is available year-round but also eaten during the Lunar New Year celebrations. This recipe produces a slightly chewy candy, with some crunch on the sides. It\u2019s a relatively easy candy to make, but you\u2019ll want to follow the directions closely when preparing the syrup. The addition of water helps to evenly dissolve the sugar as the syrup cooks. Do not stir the sugar as it cooks or it will crystallize, forming small clumps instead of a smooth syrup. It can be hard to see a visual cue when toasting black sesame seeds. A subtle indication that they are toasted is that they feel a bit hollow compared to before they are toasted \u2014 or you can simply trust their scent: They\u2019ll smell fragrant and toasted.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sue Li"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/19/multimedia/sl-sesame-candy-bhcq/sl-sesame-candy-bhcq-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 36 pieces", "recipeCuisine": "chinese", "recipeCategory": "quick, snack, candies, dessert", "keywords": "corn syrup, lunar new year, make-ahead, sesame seed, sugar", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 29}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups/215 grams black sesame seeds", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "Cooking spray, as needed", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "2 tablespoons light corn syrup"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
