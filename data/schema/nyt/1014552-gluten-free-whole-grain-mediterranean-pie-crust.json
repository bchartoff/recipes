{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Gluten-Free Whole Grain Mediterranean Pie Crust", "description": "For the flour here I use the same 70 percent whole grain flour to 30 percent starch (like potato starch, arrowroot or cornstarch) that I used in my whole grain gluten-free muffins a few weeks ago. It is based on a formula created by Shauna James Ahern, a gluten-free food blogger. Because there is no gluten involved you don\u2019t have to worry about overworking the dough, but  the dough can break apart if you try to roll it out. I just press it into the pan, which is easy to do. I love the strong, nutty-flavored combination of buckwheat flour and millet flour. If you want a crust with a milder flavor, try a combination of cornmeal and millet flours or teff and millet flours.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/19/science/18recipehealth/18recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "Two 9- or 10-inch tarts", "recipeCuisine": "mediterranean", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free flour blend, millet flour, olive oil, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 34}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 654, "unsaturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "87 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "29 grams", "fiberContent": "8 grams", "proteinContent": "15 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "619 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["120 grams (approximately 1 cup) millet flour (I make this by grinding millet in my spice mill)", "100 grams (about 4/5 cup) another whole grain gluten-free flour, like  buckwheat, cornmeal, or teff", "95 grams (approximately 7 tablespoons) potato starch, cornstarch, arrowroot or a combination", "5 grams (3/4 teaspoon) salt", "50 grams (1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil", "150 to 165 grams (2/3 to 3/4 cup) water", "10 grams (2 teaspoons) red wine vinegar or strained lemon juice (optional; the reason for the acid is that it relaxes the gluten in flour, but you don\u2019t have to worry about gluten)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Sift together the grain flour and starch. In a large bowl or in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle or a food processor fitted with the steel blade, add the salt and mix together. If using a bowl, make a well in the center, add the olive oil and mix in with a fork. If using a mixer or food processor, turn on and add the olive oil. When it is evenly distributed through the grain flour and starch, combine the water and vinegar or lemon juice and add it with the machine running. The dough should come together in a ball.\nIn most cases you won\u2019t need as much water as is required for wheat flour dough, because the grain flours don\u2019t absorb as much, but each combination behaves a little differently. Divide into 2 equal pieces, shape into a flat circle and wrap tightly with plastic. The dough may be sticky, so flour your hands and work surface.
