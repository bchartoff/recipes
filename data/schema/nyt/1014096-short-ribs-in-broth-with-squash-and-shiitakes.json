We were to be guests at a dinner party, the first of the season, at which the hostess set the table indoors. I would bring the main course for eight to accompany several bottles of zinfandels from Sonoma.I simmered short ribs and mushrooms in broth seasoned with soy sauce to play off the earthy wines. An enrichment of sake and, eventually, delicata squash echoed their fruit. The steaming, soupy meat and vegetables were ladled over boiled soba noodles. With time to spare, I was able to refrigerate the dish overnight so the fat could congeal for easy removal, the benefit of planning.
