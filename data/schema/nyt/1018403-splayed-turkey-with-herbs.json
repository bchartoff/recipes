{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Splayed Turkey With Herbs", "description": "This unorthodox method for roasting a turkey gives you a delicious, evenly cooked bird \u2014 fast. Before roasting, the bird\u2019s legs are splayed so they lie flat on the bottom of the roasting pan, where they are seared. That jump-starts the cooking of the dark meat (which always needs more time than the white meat). Then, after searing, the bird is surrounded by onions and wine before going into the oven; this essentially braises the dark meat while the breast meat roasts. The result is tender dark meat and juicy white meat, all ready in under 2 hours in the oven. An added bonus: You\u2019ll get a pan full of rich oniony drippings that can enrich your gravy, or take its place entirely.\n\nTo get the deepest flavor, this recipe calls for dry-brining your bird at least a day or two ahead. But you can reduce the brining time to 2 hours if you\u2019re pressed for time.\u00a0Also, if you're trying this with a bird that weighs more than 13 pounds, you will need an extra-large roast pan, and to roast it for a bit longer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/03/multimedia/clark-turkey/clark-turkey-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT2H30M", "recipeYield": "12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "fall, winter, main course, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 253}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 12-pound turkey, giblets and neck removed and saved for stock", "2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper", "Finely grated zest of 1 lemon", "1 bunch lemon thyme or regular thyme", "10 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled", "2 fresh or dried bay leaves", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling", "Dry white wine, as needed, for the pan", "1 large onion, halved and sliced 3/4-inch thick (not thinner, or slices may burn)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using a sharp knife, cut through the skin that connects legs to the breast on both sides of the turkey.
