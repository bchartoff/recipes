{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Broiled Mussels With Garlicky Herb Butter", "description": "Garlic-laden herb butter is often called snail butter, because the French use it on roasted snails. But it&rsquo;s too good to be relegated to snails &mdash; after all, how often do you cook snails? In this recipe, the green-flecked butter, flavored with a little Pernod, is slathered on mussels on the half shell, then broiled until the tops are brown-edged and golden. Although this recipes is somewhat involved, none of the steps are hard, and every except for the broiling can be done in advance. Save any leftover mussels and butter to toss with hot pasta for dinner the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/18/dining/18JPAPPE3/18JPAPPE3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "appetizer, mussels", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 97}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 214, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "7 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "12 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "289 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup parsley leaves\n", "2 large garlic cloves\n", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n", "1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n", "10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n", "1/4 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons Pernod or pastis\n", "2 pounds mussels, scrubbed\n", "1/3 cup bread crumbs\n"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, pulse together parsley, garlic, salt and pepper until finely chopped.
