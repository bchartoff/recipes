{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Vaguely Vietnamese Slow Cooker Pork Tacos", "description": "This recipe uses a mixture of hoisin and fish sauces as braising liquid, and is a riff on an old Corinne Trang recipe for wok-fried rib tips. It results in a vaguely Vietnamese tangle of pulled pork that is best accompanied by a bright and crunchy slaw, and served on warm flour tortillas that recall the soft pliancy of Chinese bao. Cooking time will vary depending on the slow cooker you\u2019re using, but generally the meat begins to fall apart nicely in the neighborhood of 5 to 7 hours. And of course you don't need a slow cooker. To make the dish in a covered dutch oven, cook in a 325-350 degree oven for 4 or 5 hours, or until the meat shreds easily from the bone.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/dining/18CROCKPOT5/18CROCKPOT5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT7H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "vietnamese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, tacos", "keywords": "cabbage, flour tortillas, pork shoulder, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1799}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon sesame oil", "1 medium-size yellow onion, peeled and diced", "8 cloves garlic, peeled and minced", "2 tablespoons fresh ginger, peeled and minced", "1/2 cup hoisin sauce", "1/4 cup fish sauce", "1 tablespoon sriracha sauce", "1/2 bone-in pork shoulder, skin and fat removed, approximately 5 pounds", "12 to 16 flour tortillas, warmed", "1/3 cup rice vinegar", "2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger", "1 tablespoon sesame oil", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, like peanut or grapeseed", "1 teaspoon sriracha sauce, or to taste", "1 small green cabbage, cored and sliced thinly", "2 medium-size cucumbers, peeled and sliced into julienne", "2 medium-size carrots, peeled and sliced into julienne", "1 Asian pear, peeled, cored and sliced into julienne", "1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, rinsed, dried and roughly chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the pork: Place a saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat.
