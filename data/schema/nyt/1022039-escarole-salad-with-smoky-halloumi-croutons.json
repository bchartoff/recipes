{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Escarole Salad With Smoky Halloumi Croutons", "description": "If you believe the only thing better than cheese is fried cheese, then you may just love halloumi. Because of its high melting point, halloumi browns before it melts, making it perfect for frying, grilling or any kind of searing. Here, it\u2019s pan-fried with smoked paprika, then added to an escarole salad with a garlicky, lemony dressing. Slivered red onion adds pungency, while fresh parsley leaves brighten everything. If you can get the pomegranate seeds, do use them; they add a juicy sweetness that\u2019s perfect with the richness of the cheese. Serve it by itself as a first or salad course, or with roasted vegetables, fish or chicken to round it out.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/31/dining/26apperex/merlin_185453274_f9e3ba44-50fa-4da6-bd32-b053fc6a72a0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, salads and dressings, main course", "keywords": "escarole, halloumi, lemon, parsley, shallot, smoked paprika, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 363}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small garlic clove, grated or pressed", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste", "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "6 ounces halloumi cheese, diced into 1-inch cubes and patted dry", "3/4 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika (piment\u00f3n)", "6 cups escarole, torn into bite-size pieces", "1 cup parsley leaves and tender stems", "1/2 shallot, or 1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced", "Pomegranate seeds, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together garlic, lemon juice and salt.
