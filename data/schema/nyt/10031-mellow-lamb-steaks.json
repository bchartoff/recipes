{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mellow Lamb Steaks", "description": "Buy lamb steaks if you can -- though if you want to tack a bit, duck breasts also work quite well. While the garlic is poaching in its pan, fry the steaks in a scant amount of olive oil until they are flavor-sealed and heat-darkened outside, but still juicily tender within.\n\nAt this stage, slosh in the contents of the simmering pan. Add the juice of the half-zested orange and a slug of Marsala (though sherry, brandy or any wine you have open will do), along with some leaves stripped from thyme sprigs. Let everything bubble away a little, the sauce lapping the meat in the pan, before removing the steaks and reducing the liquid until it is a gorgeous, savory, shiny syrup.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Nigella Lawson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/25/dining/lambsteaks/lambsteaks-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "fall, garlic, lamb, orange zest, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 35}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 430, "unsaturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "32 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "23 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "sodiumContent": "550 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 cloves garlic, peeled and halved lengthwise", "Finely grated zest of 1/2 orange", "4 6-ounce lamb steaks", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "Juice of 1 orange", "1 tablespoon Marsala, sherry or other wine", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In small saucepan, combine garlic, zest and 3/4 cup water.
