They replaced the graham-cracker crust with homemade graham crackers, turned the mousse into ice cream and elevated it with a relatively abstemious dose of Cognac. On the surface, it\u2019s a tasty trifle, but there is subtlety too, with a little cinnamon here, some salt there.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/29/dining/Cognac-Ice-Cream-Sandwiches/Cognac-Ice-Cream-Sandwiches-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "Makes 10 ice-cream sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 20}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 618, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "59 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "39 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "24 grams", "sodiumContent": "272 milligrams", "sugarContent": "35 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups flour", "1/2 cup wheat flour", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon", "1 cup unsalted butter", "1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup honey", "1 cup milk", "2 cups cream", "2/3 cup sugar", "6 egg yolks", "2 tablespoons Cognac", "2 tablespoons chocolate liqueur"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the graham crackers: sift together the flours, salt and cinnamon.
