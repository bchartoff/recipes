{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Tomato Gazpacho With Crunchy Pecorino", "description": "At lunchtime on a steamy day, I got the unlikely idea to cross a smoothie with gazpacho. Given my languid state, I had wanted something icy and filling, but not too taxing to prepare.\nThat\u2019s when the idea to merge a gazpacho and a smoothie crept into my head. I\u2019d swap tomatoes for the usual berries; add garlic, oil, vinegar and salt to punch up the flavor; and keep the yogurt for heft.\n\nAs the blender whirled, my stomach growled, and I nibbled on pieces of crunchy cheese cracker I had left over from a recent salad. Instead of croutons, I like to fry grated cheese until crisp, then crumble it over greens. For this batch, I had used pecorino, which seemed like a natural complement to the sheep\u2019s-milk yogurt. So I saved some for garnish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/creamy-garlicky-tomato-gazpacho/creamy-garlicky-tomato-gazpacho-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, gluten-free, vegetarian, pecorino romano, tomato, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 194}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 287, "unsaturatedFatContent": "14 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "11 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "555 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons grated pecorino Romano", "2 large tomatoes (about 1 pound), cored and roughly chopped", "1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) plain sheep\u2019s-milk or regular yogurt", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, more for serving", "12 basil leaves, roughly chopped, more for serving", "2 large garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped", "2 scallions (white and light green parts), roughly chopped", "2 ice cubes", "1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoons red wine vinegar, more to taste", "Pinch cayenne pepper", "Ground black pepper to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
