{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach-Basil Pesto", "description": "This pesto is so simple, and its mild, herbaceous flavor makes it the ideal companion for just about any of the meatballs. While many pesto recipes call for pine nuts, we prefer the flavor (and lower price) of walnuts. Try roughly chopping them to add a nice, crunchy texture. We also love this as a healthy party dip, especially because it has no raw garlic \u2014 your guests will thank you too! You can swap arugula for spinach if you prefer. Pesto freezes well and will keep for up to three months in the freezer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/11/health/Well_veggie_pesto/Well_veggie_pesto-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "gluten-free, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 105}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 40, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "18 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup roughly chopped walnuts", "4 cups baby spinach leaves", "2 cups fresh basil", "1 teaspoon salt or to taste", "1/2 cup olive oil", "1/4 cup grated rennet-free Parmesan cheese"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
