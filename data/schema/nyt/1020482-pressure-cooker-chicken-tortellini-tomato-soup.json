{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pressure Cooker Chicken Tortellini Tomato Soup", "description": "This comforting soup is a one-pot meal-in-a-bowl. The key to its deliciousness is the way in which the pressure cooker makes the soup taste as though it\u2019s been simmered for hours when, in fact, it\u2019s been only about 30 minutes. (You could also make <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020481-slow-cooker-chicken-tortellini-tomato-soup\">the slow-cooker version</a> of this recipe, if time is on your side.) Quick-cooking baby spinach works beautifully, but you can choose a different green if you prefer: If you use a heartier green, like chopped kale or chard, give it a few more minutes to get tender before adding the tortellini. If you\u2019re planning for leftovers, add only the tortellini you will eat right away. Left in the soup, they will overcook. Be generous with toppings; they make the soup even more delicious.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/dining/sd-pressure-cooker-chicken-tortellini-soup/sd-pressure-cooker-chicken-tortellini-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, pastas, soups and stews", "keywords": "basil, chicken thigh, crushed canned tomatoes, spinach, tortellini, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 134}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons tomato paste", "4 cups chicken stock or broth", "1/4 cup dry white wine", "1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, preferably fire roasted", "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, preferably aged", "6 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "Roughly chopped leaves from 3 to 4 sprigs fresh oregano (about 2 tablespoons chopped) or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano", "2 teaspoons onion powder", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as necessary", "1 3/4 to 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "5 ounces baby spinach", "1 (8- to 10-ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini", "1 cup grated Parmesan, for serving", "Torn or shredded fresh basil, for serving", "Black pepper, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a 6- or 8-quart electric pressure cooker, whisk together the tomato paste, stock and wine until the paste dissolves.
