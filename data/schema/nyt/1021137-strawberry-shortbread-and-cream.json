{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Strawberry Shortbread and Cream", "description": "In this summery dessert, golden-edged cookies are paired with syrupy strawberries and fluffy whipped cream for a result that\u2019s a bit like strawberry shortcake, but crunchier and a lot more buttery. These cookies have a little more sugar than most shortbread recipes, so they\u2019re especially crisp, but since they are on the sweet side, use a light hand when adding sugar to the berries. You just need enough to get the juices flowing. A few pinches should do it. And if you use cultured butter, the cookies will be even richer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/10/dining/05apperex/05apperex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings, plus extra shortbread", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars, parfaits and trifles, dessert", "keywords": "birthday, fourth of july, memorial day, heavy cream, strawberries, vanilla, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 484}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), preferably cultured (European-style), at room temperature", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 egg yolk", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and seeded with the tip of a knife, or 1 tablespoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon orange blossom water or grated orange zest (optional)", "2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour", "1 pint strawberries, sliced", "Granulated sugar, to taste", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Using an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or an electric hand mixer, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
