Just coat your ingredients with a generous amount of olive oil, seasoning well with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and  place them on a baking sheet. Put it in the oven at a high temperature (in this recipe 425 degrees) and let the heat do the work. The vegetables will soften and caramelize, offering real depth of flavor. Here, we add shrimp at the end, which cooks quickly, to deliver an easy weeknight meal.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/11/dining/mc-roasted-shrimp-broccoli/mc-roasted-shrimp-broccoli-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, quick, weekday", "keywords": "broccoli, shrimp, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 707}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 282, "unsaturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "17 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "16 grams", "fiberContent": "6 grams", "proteinContent": "22 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "828 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 pounds broccoli, cut into bite-size florets", "4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil", "1 teaspoon whole coriander seeds", "1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/8 teaspoon hot chili powder", "1 pound large shrimp, shelled and deveined", "1 1/4 teaspoons lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)", "Lemon wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
