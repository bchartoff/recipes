{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Baked Potato Soup", "description": "If we\u2019re being honest, a baked potato isn\u2019t really about the potato. It\u2019s about the toppings: plush sour cream, butter, cheese, salty bacon, bright scallions. This soup version doesn\u2019t skimp on those extras: The potatoes simmer in milk with garlic and scallions until just tender, then they join sour cream and Cheddar in the pot before the toppings \u2014 including potato skins \u2014 are added. It\u2019s potatoey, creamy and adaptable. Make it smooth or textured, skip the bacon and serve it with a side salad (though it\u2019s plenty hearty all on its own).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/14/dining/as-baked-potato-soup/as-baked-potato-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, weekday, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, bacon, cheddar, milk, potato, scallions, sour cream, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 638}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 774, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "65 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "49 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "24 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "27 grams", "sodiumContent": "1664 milligrams", "sugarContent": "22 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 slices bacon, or 3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 bunch scallions, white and green parts thinly sliced separately", "4 garlic cloves, minced", "2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes, large skins reserved", "6 cups whole milk", "Kosher salt", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "Black pepper", "1/8 teaspoon cayenne", "1/8 teaspoon garlic powder", "3/4 cup sour cream, plus more for serving", "3/4 cup freshly grated Cheddar (about 3 ounces), plus more for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the bacon (if using) until crisp, 12 to 13 minutes.
