This dish is among those I\u2019ve shared with others, and one that I share here in honor of my dear friend <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/business/media/liyna-anwar-dies.html\">Liyna Anwar</a>, who died a year ago. We were colleagues, and, because she was Muslim and ate strictly halal, I often brought her vegetarian dishes to sample. This was among her favorites: a deeply earthy dish that is sumptuous and nourishing. Green plantains are finely grated, mixed with simple spices, formed into balls with a spoon, and then dunked directly into simmering pigeon peas; the natural starch of the plantains sets up without added flour. Liyna once prepared this dish alongside me, delighting in the experience of forming the buoyant dumplings. The memory of her happiness blends now with my own memories of eating it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/22Puertoricanrex9-Gandules/merlin_184863213_8c687c5c-c08a-41c5-a0df-37af8bd90693-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, caribbean, latin american", "recipeCategory": "grains and rice, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "ground annatto, pigeon peas, plantain", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 90}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "3/4 cup <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022007-sofrito\">sofrito</a>", "1 pound home-cooked or canned gandules (pigeon peas), drained (about 5 to 6 cups); see Notes", "8 cups vegetable stock", "2 dried bay leaves", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "3 very green plantains, peeled and soaked in cold water until ready to use (see Notes)", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground annatto or sweet paprika", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "Cooked white rice, for serving", "Sliced avocado, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the gandules: Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high.
