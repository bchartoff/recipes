{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramelized Sheet-Pan French Toast", "description": "Caramelized and crunchy on the outside, soft and custardy on the inside, these almost comically thick sourdough slices taste like the love child of bread pudding and French toast. But instead of the usual brioche or challah, this calls for sturdier bread, preferably a not-too-tangy sourdough or country bread with a crust that\u2019s neither chewy nor thick. You want a round or oblong loaf large enough for big pieces and soft enough to absorb the custard. It\u2019s easy to caramelize the French toast in the oven, but the timing depends on your oven and pan, so check it frequently to ensure that it\u2019s burnished but not burned.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Susan Spungen"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/09/dining/04leisurerex2-french-toast/merlin_180333048_a542d84a-5d16-473a-b780-4f6ad6baae41-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, main course", "keywords": "christmas, new year\u2019s day, cream, eggs, french toast, milk, plan-ahead, sourdough", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1123}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 large eggs", "1 large egg yolk", "1 cup whole milk", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "Pinch of kosher salt", "1 teaspoon vanilla paste or extract", "A few gratings of fresh nutmeg", "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons/125 grams granulated sugar", "1 tablespoon orange or grapefruit liqueur (optional)", "2 (2-inch-thick) slices sourdough or country bread, halved", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Maple syrup and berries, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "The day before serving, in a medium bowl, combine eggs, egg yolk, milk, cream, salt, vanilla, nutmeg, cardamom, 2 tablespoons/25 grams sugar and the liqueur, if using.
