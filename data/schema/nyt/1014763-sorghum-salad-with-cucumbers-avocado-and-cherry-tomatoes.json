In the case of sorghum, the grain is done after 50 minutes, but if you let it go for another 10 the grains will burst and the lemon juice and olive oil won\u2019t slide off.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/29/science/29recipehealth/29recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "weekday, salads and dressings", "keywords": "avocado, cucumber, sorghum, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, healthy, high fiber, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 205, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "21 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "687 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup sorghum", "2 cups water", "Salt to taste", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (from 1 large bunch)", "1/4 cup chopped cilantro", "1 heaped cup cherry tomatoes, quartered (about 6 ounces)", "3/4 pound cucumbers (1 European or 4 Persian), seeded if using regular cucumbers, cut in fine dice ", "1 bunch scallions, finely chopped, or 1/4 cup chopped chives", "1 small ripe avocado, diced", "Salt to taste", "1 romaine lettuce heart, leaves separated, washed and dried"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the sorghum, water and salt to taste (I use 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon).
