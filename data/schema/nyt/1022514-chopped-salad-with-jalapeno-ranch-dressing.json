{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chopped Salad With Jalape\u00f1o-Ranch Dressing", "description": "This chopped salad is fresh, festive and excessive in a celebratory way. While most salads opt for the lightest layer of dressing to optimize the produce\u2019s flavors, this one calls for the dressing to generously coat the crisp ingredients. Inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018732-caesar-salad\">Caesar salad</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019546-classic-ranch-dressing\">ranch dressing</a> and the dinner-worthy salads popularized at chain restaurants like California Pizza Kitchen, this salad is punchy and satisfying, thanks to rich ingredients, like avocado, Cotija and a mayonnaise-thickened dressing, plus those with bite, like radishes, corn kernels and tortilla chips. Pair the salad with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022297-grilled-tofu\">grilled tofu</a>, chicken, shrimp or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020256-juicy-lucy-burger\">burgers</a> \u2014 or nothing at all. This salad eschews subtlety, and hits all the right notes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/02/dining/aw-Chopped-Salad-with-Jalapeno-Ranch-Dressing/aw-Chopped-Salad-with-Jalapeno-Ranch-Dressing-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "corn, jalape\u00f1o, romaine, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1335}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 cup buttermilk", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "3 large scallions, trimmed and finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)", "1/3 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro", "2 tablespoons finely chopped jalape\u00f1o with its seeds (or to taste)", "1 lime, zested", "1/2 teaspoon onion powder", "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "3 romaine hearts (about 1 pound), trimmed and chopped into bite-size pieces", "3 fresh ears of corn, shucked, kernels removed from cobs", "8 radishes, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced into half-moons", "2 large, ripe avocados, pitted and diced", "5 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced at an angle", "1/2 cup crumbled Cotija (or grated Parmesan)", "1 cup chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems", "2 cups crumbled lime tortilla chips (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the dressing: In a large measuring cup, whisk all the dressing ingredients together to combine.
