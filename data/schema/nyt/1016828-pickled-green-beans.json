My only reservation about making pickles out of green beans is that it is impossible for the beans to retain their wonderful green color. But I forget about this regret when I taste them, redolent as they are with coriander seeds and dill. You can serve them as an aperitif, garnish or side, or cut them up and add them to salads.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/07/science/10recipehealth/10recipehealth-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "1 pint", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, snack", "keywords": "dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, kosher, low cholesterol, low-fat, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, summer, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 93}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 88, "unsaturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "656 milligrams", "sugarContent": "9 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 to 7 ounces green beans", "1 teaspoon coriander seeds", "1 teaspoon mustard seeds", "1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns", "3 sprigs fresh dill", "1 bay leaf", "1/2 cup white wine vinegar", "1/2 cup sherry vinegar", "1/2 cup water", "1 tablespoon raw brown (turbinado) sugar", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 large garlic clove, quartered"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rinse green beans and break off stem ends.
