{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spinach and Pea Fritters", "description": "As a vegetable-forward weeknight meal, these spinach fritters have it all: sweet peas, gooey cheese and crispy bits. Made from thawed, frozen peas and spinach, the work is minimal. If you\u2019d like to use fresh peas and spinach, you\u2019ll need to quickly blanch and drain them first. Fresh mozzarella adds a pleasant creaminess, but goat cheese or feta would work, too. Serve these over quinoa or rice, or top with a poached or fried egg for brunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/15/dining/sse-pea-fritters/sse-pea-fritters-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 servings (about 12 fritters)", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, dinner, lunch, finger foods, vegetables, appetizer, main course, side dish", "keywords": "frozen peas, greek yogurt, herbs, mozzarella, pea greens, spinach, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 379}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (10-ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed", "3 large eggs", "1 garlic clove, minced", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 (10-ounce) package frozen peas, thawed and very coarsely mashed", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "4 ounces fresh mozzarella, diced (about 1 cup)", "1/3 cup chopped mixed tender herbs, such as scallions, mint, dill, cilantro and parsley, plus more for garnish", "1 lemon, zested, then cut into wedges for serving", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 cup olive oil, for frying, plus more as needed", "Greek yogurt or sour cream, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Squeeze the excess water out of the spinach and set aside.
