Here, it\u2019s combined with coconut milk, which mellows the spicy gochujang into a creamy sauce. Fresh ginger is the key ingredient, infusing the sauce with brightness and spice that balance the rich coconut. This recipe calls for broccoli as the vegetable accompaniment, but cauliflower or brussels sprouts would also work.
