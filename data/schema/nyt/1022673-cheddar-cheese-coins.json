{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cheddar Cheese Coins", "description": "These snacks are packed with an intense cheese flavor that comes from blending extra-sharp Cheddar with nutty Parmesan. Mild scallions and spicy black pepper bring additional savory notes, which play up that cheesiness. The coins have golden crispy edges and slightly tender centers. They\u2019re great for snacking on the go, serving as part of a cheese board or dunking into tomato soup. The recipe can easily be doubled for a holiday cookie swap, and the dough can be made 1 month ahead and kept frozen wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored in a resealable plastic bag; simply thaw, cut and bake when ready.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/12/08/dining/08COOKIESREX17-COINS/merlin_198248727_fa464ca1-7226-45d2-b06c-5ef3dc54c5cb-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H50M", "recipeYield": "About 5 dozen cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "snack, appetizer, dessert", "keywords": "black pepper, christmas cookie, freezer friendly, scallion, sharp cheddar cheese", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 366}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup/104 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for surfaces", "1 cup/85 grams finely shredded extra-sharp Cheddar", "1/3 cup/33 grams freshly grated Parmesan", "3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)", "1/4 teaspoon paprika", "5 tablespoons/71 grams cold unsalted butter, cubed", "1/3 cup/44 grams finely chopped scallions", "2 to 3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, for coating (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, both cheeses, black pepper, salt and paprika, and pulse until well combined and sandy, about 30 seconds.
