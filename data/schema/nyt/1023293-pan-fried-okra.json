Such is the case for the matriarch\u2019s pan-fried okra, from her cookbook \u201cGullah Geechee Home Cooking: Recipes From the Matriarch of Edisto Island\u201d (Abrams, 2022), a book that I co-wrote. Her recipe is constructed around the use of fresh, seasonal okra pods. Mrs. Meggett dismisses what she views as the excessive use of dairy-based cornmeal batters in restaurant versions of fried okra; instead, she lightly coats her okra, allowing the beauty and taste of the vegetable to shine in each mouthful.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kayla Stewart"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/13/dining/13okrarex1-1/merlin_209335167_db1c5e59-740a-4171-a4db-f05e638513cc-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american, southern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, snack, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "cornmeal, okra, yellow cornmeal, summer, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 92}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 cups okra (about 1 1/3 pounds)\u00a0", "4 1/2 teaspoons salt (any type), plus more to taste", "1 1/2 cups/340 grams fine or medium yellow cornmeal, plus more if needed", "2 cups vegetable oil, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Wash the okra, and place aside, leaving the okra slightly wet.
