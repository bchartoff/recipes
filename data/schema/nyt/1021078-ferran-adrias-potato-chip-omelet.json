The chef of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/10/magazine/a-laboratory-of-taste.html\">El Bulli</a>, the famous Spanish restaurant, Mr. Adri\u00e0\u00a0created an omelet reminiscent of a\u00a0<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/8849-spanish-tortilla\">Spanish tortilla</a> that comes together in minutes using only eggs, salted potato chips and olive oil. As with any recipe calling for just a few ingredients, quality truly matters here, so opt for the best potato chips, the finest olive oil and the freshest eggs. There\u2019s no need to season the dish with salt, Mr. Adri\u00e0 advises,\u00a0since the chips are already salted, but serving the omelet with salt and pepper adds nuance. If you like, add finely sliced chives, a handful of grated Manchego or perhaps a pinch of piment d\u2019Espelette or paprika like a true tortilla Espa\u00f1ola.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/dining/aw-potato-chip-omelet/merlin_172221678_d278d523-612b-4c7a-88d4-d99555619850-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, quick, weekday, main course", "keywords": "egg, olive oil, potato chips", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2186}, "recipeIngredient": ["12 large eggs", "6 ounces potato chips (about 6 cups)", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk vigorously until frothy and lightened in color, about 4 minutes.
