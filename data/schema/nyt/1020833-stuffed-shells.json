{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Stuffed Shells", "description": "Of all the baked pasta dishes, stuffed shells are beloved for good reason: The fluffy ricotta filling, punchy tomato sauce, melted cheese and oversize noodles creates the ultimate comfort food, and the make-ahead aspect is equally compelling. The tomato sauce can be made and refrigerated five days ahead, or you can save time by swapping in three cups of your favorite store-bought marinara sauce. The shells can be assembled a few hours ahead, then baked from the refrigerator an hour before it\u2019s time to eat. While some versions add frozen spinach, herbs or lemon, you really don\u2019t need anything beyond the basics; this classic version is pure comfort.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/dining/as-stuffed-shells/merlin_168064221_2d4e3fab-b4d6-4138-9eb1-c02ad83a8e29-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, casseroles, pastas", "keywords": "fall, winter, main course, mozzarella, parmesan, pasta, ricotta, tomato sauce, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 233}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 medium onion, finely chopped", "Kosher salt", "4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced", "3 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 (28-ounce) can tomato pur\u00e9e", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 pound fresh ricotta (about 2 cups)", "10 ounces fresh mozzarella, grated (about 2 1/2 cups)", "5 1/2 ounces Parmesan, finely grated (about 2 cups)", "2 egg yolks", "1 garlic clove", "12 ounces jumbo shells"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the sauce: In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat the olive oil over medium.
