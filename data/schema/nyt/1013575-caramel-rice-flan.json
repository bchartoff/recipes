{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramel Rice Flan", "description": "In Catalonia, many of the rice dishes are made with short grain rice. The pillowy texture of the short grains reminds me of tapioca, with a grainier bite. Short grain rice is also starchier than long grain, which helps the eggs bind the custard. Combining whole eggs and yolks would make the flan rich and light.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/dining/caramel-rice-flan/caramel-rice-flan-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "arborio rice, milk, dessert, gluten-free", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 335, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "45 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "sodiumContent": "135 milligrams", "sugarContent": "33 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Butter or cooking spray for the souffl\u00e9 dish", "2/3 cup Arborio rice", "4 3/4 cups milk", "2 3-inch cinnamon sticks", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom", "Grated zest of 1 lemon", "2 teaspoons cardamom pods, cracked with the side of a knife", "3/4 cup heavy cream", "3 eggs", "2 egg yolks", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 1/3 cups sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 300 degrees.
