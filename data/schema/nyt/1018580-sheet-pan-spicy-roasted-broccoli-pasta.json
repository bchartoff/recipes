{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Spicy Roasted Broccoli Pasta", "description": "Think of this as the sheet-pan version of a classic, cheese-covered pasta bake. It has all the elements of the usual casserole \u2014 the pasta and vegetables tossed with ricotta and topped with Parmesan-dusted bread crumbs. But because all the ingredients are spread out on a sheet pan instead of being piled into a baking dish, everything browns, which in turn means more crunch and crisp edges. First, the broccoli is roasted until it softens and browns. Then, the other ingredients are spooned on top, and everything is quickly baked, making for a speedy, vegetarian weeknight meal. It\u2019s worth seeking out really good ricotta here. With so few ingredients, every one makes a difference.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/22/dining/22APPE1/22APPE1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, pastas", "keywords": "broccoli, panko, pasta, ricotta, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2220}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 676, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "89 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "23 grams", "fiberContent": "11 grams", "proteinContent": "33 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "10 grams", "sodiumContent": "660 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 1/2 pounds broccoli, cut into bite-size florets", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed", "1 teaspoon cumin seeds (optional)", "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste", "12 ounces chiocciole or other tube-shaped pasta", "1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese", "1/3 cup panko bread crumbs", "1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "12 ounces best quality, whole milk ricotta", "Fresh lemon juice, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
