{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Salad With Apple Cider Vinaigrette", "description": "With its delicate, crisp bite, this salad can be a simple addition to your holiday spread. Dressed with an acidic, lightly sweetened cider vinaigrette, it carries a lot of the bright notes of the season and uses ingredients you most likely have on hand. Green is the theme but not the rule, so any sour-sweet red apple will also work just great. The nuts are optional but add a hearty crunch.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yewande Komolafe"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/09komolaferex3-salad/merlin_215733987_776c3f3e-4d07-49ff-99ff-742c1c12b25c-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "apple, arugula, cider vinegar, green salad, romaine, thanksgiving, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 346}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon dark brown sugar", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1 green apple, cored, quartered and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons chopped chives", "1 head green leaf lettuce, trimmed, leaves pulled apart, washed and torn into large pieces", "1 head romaine, trimmed, leaves pulled apart, washed and torn into large pieces", "2 cups baby arugula", "1/4 cup chopped, toasted pecans or walnuts (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine the cider vinegar, mustard, dark brown sugar and 1 teaspoon room-temperature water.
