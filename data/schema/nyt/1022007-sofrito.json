{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sofrito", "description": "Sofrito \u2014 a blend of garlic, onions, peppers and recao (culantro) \u2014 is the backbone of Puerto Rican flavor. Also referred to as recaito, it\u2019s typically saut\u00e9ed in oil as the foundation for sauces, braises, beans, stews and rice dishes. It\u2019s also adaptable, and can yield a lighter, more verdant flavor if saut\u00e9ed for 2 to 3 minutes, and a richer flavor if saut\u00e9ed for 7 to 10 minutes and combined with tomato sauce. This recipe yields about 3 cups, which is probably more than you\u2019ll use for any recipe, but it keeps well. My grandmother often kept sofrito in the freezer stored in a repurposed plastic margarine container, or frozen into cubes and saved in plastic zip-top bags. If kept in the refrigerator, it\u2019s best if used within a week, but can be frozen for up to six months. You can also put it into a pan with hot oil straight from the freezer, though it may sputter a smidge.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Von Diaz"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/24/dining/22Puertoricanrex12-Sofritos/merlin_184863105_cfb9c633-ba52-4822-9606-256e13ddb94e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "About 2 1/4 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "condiments", "keywords": "aji dulce pepper, cilantro, culantro, freezer friendly, make-ahead, puerto rican, red bell pepper", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 176}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and cut into quarters", "3 aj\u00ed dulce or amarillo peppers (or mini bell peppers), seeded and coarsely chopped (see Notes)", "6 large garlic cloves", "1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped", "6 fresh culantro leaves and tender stems, coarsely chopped (see Notes)", "6 fresh cilantro stems, coarsely chopped"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large food processor or blender, blend the peppers and garlic until smooth."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the onion and blend until smooth, then add the culantro and cilantro, and blend until smooth.
