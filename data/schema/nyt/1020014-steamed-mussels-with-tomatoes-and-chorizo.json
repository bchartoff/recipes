It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.</i>\n\nSimplicity itself, if you can find a bag of mussels at the store. Scrub and debeard them as necessary. Then grab a big pot, and use it to saut\u00e9 some cubed chorizo in olive oil over medium-high heat. When it starts to crisp, add a few handfuls of halved cherry tomatoes and a clove or two of chopped garlic. Let the tomatoes blister in the fat, then add the mussels and a glass of white wine. Cover the pot and allow the mussels to steam open. (If at the end you have mussels that haven\u2019t opened, ditch them: They\u2019re dead.) Garnish with chopped parsley and serve with plenty of toast for the sopping.\n\n<i>Sam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/cooking\">Sign up to receive it.</a> You can find more no-recipe recipes <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/14326423-no-recipe-recipes\">here</a>.</i>", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/dining/17NORECIPE-TOMATO-CHORIZO-MUSSELS/17NORECIPE-TOMATO-CHORIZO-MUSSELS-articleLarge.jpg", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "seafood", "keywords": "main course, mussels, tomato, white wine", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 87}, "recipeIngredient": [], "recipeInstructions": null, "link": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020014-steamed-mussels-with-tomatoes-and-chorizo"}
