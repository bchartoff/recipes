For this recipe, that\u2019s spicy arugula, dressed with olive oil, lemon and shards of Parmesan to create a salad classic in many Italian restaurants and homes. But whether olive oil or lemon should come first, like all seemingly simple questions, is complicated. James Beard, Marcella Hazan, Deborah Madison and Judy Rodgers all concurred: For a brighter-tasting salad, start with olive oil, which better adheres the liquids to the greens and doesn\u2019t obscure the lemon. Be sure to use full-flavored greens, then taste the dressed leaves and adjust seasonings until the arugula tastes like its greatest self.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/07/15/dining/AS-arugula-and-Parmesan-salad-15SALADREX/AS-arugula-and-Parmesan-salad-15SALADREX-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT5M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "easy, salads and dressings, side dish", "keywords": "arugula, lemon juice, parmesan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 262}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 to 5 ounces baby arugula", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "2 ounces Parmesan, shaved with a vegetable peeler"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the arugula in a very large bowl, ideally one that could hold twice as many leaves.
