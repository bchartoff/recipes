{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Soup Joumou", "description": "For Haitians, soup joumou is synonymous with freedom. The story goes that during French colonial rule of Haiti, enslaved Africans were forced by their oppressors to cultivate squash for this dish but were not allowed to eat it. When Haitians won their independence on Jan. 1, 1804, they ate soup joumou to celebrate. The formula varies slightly from family to family, but usually includes calabaza squash, beef marinated in a bright epis seasoning of onions, peppers and herbs, an assortment of other vegetables and pasta. This classic version is adapted from \u201cLet\u2019s Speak Haitian Food: Stories from the Haitian Diaspora on Cuisine, Community and Culture\u201d by Cindy Similien, a Haitian-American author and community advocate. The inclusion of both vermicelli and homemade dumplings adds a springy bite and thickens the broth of this one-pot dish, which can be made on Haitian Independence Day, or for any special occasion.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Priya Krishna"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/29/dining/29Haitianrex1/merlin_181421682_e4bc0c50-cc2a-4ccb-a8c8-3d9ff0c67410-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 10 servings (about 20 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat, soups and stews, main course", "keywords": "beef, cabbage, flour, lime, potato, vermicelli", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 347}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large green bell pepper, stemmed and chopped", "1 medium red bell pepper, stemmed and chopped", "1/2 white onion, chopped", "1/4 cup white vinegar", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 celery stalk, chopped", "2 scallions, trimmed and chopped", "1 fresh parsley sprig", "5 garlic cloves, peeled", "1 chicken bouillon cube", "1/2 teaspoon fresh or dried thyme leaves", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 pound boneless beef chuck, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "1/2 cup fresh lime juice (from about 3 limes)", "5 tablespoons epis seasoning", "2 pounds calabaza squash, peeled and roughly chopped", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 chicken bouillon cube", "5 medium Idaho or russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes", "1/2 small head green cabbage, shredded (about 3 cups)", "4 medium carrots, peeled and sliced", "1 large white onion, finely chopped", "2 celery stalks, cut into 1/2-inch pieces", "2 scallions, trimmed and sliced", "3 fresh parsley sprigs", "1 Scotch Bonnet pepper", "1/4 teaspoon fresh or dried thyme leaves", "2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1/2 cup vermicelli", "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the epis seasoning: Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and pur\u00e9e.
