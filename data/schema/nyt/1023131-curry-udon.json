{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Curry Udon", "description": "Japanese curry bricks deserve their place in our pantries as a staple \u2014 inexpensive, with a long shelf life, and full of fast flavor. For those without easy access to store-bought curry bricks, you can make <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020451-japanese-curry-brick\">your own</a> or opt for this recipe, in which a quick roux is made using a commercial curry powder blend. A Japanese brand like S&B is ideal, though most products labeled \u201ccurry powder\u201d will work. If you have curry bricks in your pantry, you can use them and skip to Step 4, but note the package instructions to determine how many bricks to use. This recipe makes a thick, silky broth that clings ardently to the chubby udon noodles. Potatoes, carrots and onions are common ingredients used in Japanese curry, and while the spinach is not traditional, it adds a nice green element; substitute with broccoli, baby bok choy or kale if you prefer.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Hetty McKinnon"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/18/dining/hm-curry-udon/merlin_205206765_ded4d3d3-d548-4d88-9abb-ce79e1ceffb4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "japanese", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, main course", "keywords": "curry powder, noodles, potato, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 483}, "recipeIngredient": ["Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/2 pounds fresh udon noodles (vacuum-sealed)", "1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola", "1 yellow onion, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks", "6 cups vegetarian dashi (see Tip) or vegetable stock", "2 teaspoons soy sauce or tamari", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "4 handfuls baby spinach leaves (about 5 ounces)", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1/3 cup all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons Japanese curry powder (such as S&B)", "1 tablespoon garam masala", "1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, add the udon and cook for about 2 minutes, using wooden chopsticks or tongs to gently loosen the noodles from their tight bundle.
