Just add a few minutes onto the baking time to accommodate the muffins\u2019 increased thickness. Then fork-split them, toast and serve with plenty of butter. After all, that\u2019s what those crevices are made for.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/23/dining/23ENGLISH_SPAN/23ENGLISH-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "6 muffins", "recipeCuisine": "british", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, project", "keywords": "appetizer, side dish, flour, milk, yogurt", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 468}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 253, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "35 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "225 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 teaspoons/7 grams active dry yeast (1 packet)", "4 tablespoons/60 grams unsalted butter", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters plain yogurt", "1/2 cup/120 milliliters warm whole milk", "1/2 tablespoon/7 milliliters honey", "1 teaspoon/5 grams fine sea salt", "1 cup/125 grams whole-wheat flour", "1 cup/125 grams all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon/4 grams baking soda", "Cornmeal, preferably coarse, as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl combine yeast and 1/3 cup warm water (80 milliliters) and let rest until yeast has dissolved, about 5 minutes."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Melt 2 tablespoons butter and put it in a large bowl.
