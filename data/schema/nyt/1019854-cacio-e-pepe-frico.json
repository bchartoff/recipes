{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Cacio e Pepe Frico", "description": "A delicate cracker made by baking mounds of grated cheese into weblike crisps, frico could feature a number of cheeses, be it Montasio, cheddar, Asiago or, in this case, the kinds featured in cacio e pepe. Using both Parmesan and pecorino gives a good mix of richness and tang, though you could just use Parmesan. (Pecorino on its own may be too salty once it concentrates in the oven.) Snack on these with wine or spritzes, or crumble them over pasta, salad, soup or anything that likes a grating of cheese.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/18/dining/as-frico/as-frico-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "20 crackers", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "quick, crackers and chips, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, black pepper, parmesan, pecorino", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 126}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 22, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "0 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "1 gram", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "80 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 2 ounces)", "3/4 cup freshly grated pecorino cheese (about 2 ounces)", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees, and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
