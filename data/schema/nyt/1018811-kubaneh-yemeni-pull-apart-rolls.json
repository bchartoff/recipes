{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kubaneh (Yemeni Pull-Apart Rolls)", "description": "The Jewish-Yemeni bread kubaneh was traditionally cooked in the residual heat of the hearth\u00a0on Friday\u00a0night, low and slow, ready to be eaten on Shabbat morning. At his restaurant, Nur, the chef Meir Adoni adapted a recipe that requires less than 30 minutes. You'll need a stand mixer to aggressively knead the basic yeasted dough, but afterward the fun of this bread is shaping it by hand, one bun at a time. With generously buttered hands, spread each piece of dough into a big, sheer sheet, then roll it up like a log and swirl it into a bun. Don't worry about a few rips and creases here and there in the dough as you spread it. Keep laminating, creating fine layers of fat as you roll and swirl, and those will give the baked kubaneh additional volume, texture and a rich, buttery flavor that make it one of the world's great breads.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/25/magazine/25eat1/25eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish, middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "breads", "keywords": "butter, egg, tomato, yeast", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 272}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 435, "unsaturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "76 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "13 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "sodiumContent": "412 milligrams", "sugarContent": "16 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons (30 grams) soft butter, plus 1/2 pound (226 grams) soft butter for greasing pan and shaping buns", "1 cup (225 grams) water, room temperature", "3 tablespoons (45 grams) fresh yeast, or 1 tablespoon (15 grams) instant yeast", "3 1/3 cups (450 grams) all-purpose flour", "1/2 cup (90 grams) sugar", "1 tablespoon (15 grams) kosher salt", "2 eggs", "2 tablespoons nigella seeds (optional)", "1 ripe tomato, coarsely grated", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare a 9-inch springform cake pan by buttering it and placing it on a sheet tray.

Spread 2 tablespoons of soft butter across your work surface, and place a piece of dough in the center. Cover the palms of your hands with another tablespoon of soft butter, and without lifting the dough off the counter, use your fingers and palms to flatten and smear the dough out, until it is smooth and thin and sheer in places, or approximately 12 inches in diameter. The exact shape doesn\u2019t matter much, and neither do some small rips here and there in the dough. Sprinkle some nigella seeds over the dough, then roll the dough into a long, skinny log: starting from the end farthest away from you, push the dough toward you with 8 fingertips until it gathers up into a thick enough piece to begin rolling it, then roll it all the way toward you.
