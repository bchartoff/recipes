{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Grilled Oysters With Hot-Sauce Butter", "description": "Oysters\u00a0cook quickly on a hot grill, the meat poaching in a bubbling compound butter flavored with a vinegar-rich hot sauce, garlic and lemon zest. Ideally, you can assign someone else the job of shucking and focus on the grill, making sure the\u00a0oysters\u00a0don't stay on it much longer than 2 or 3 minutes, so the meat is still plump and juicy. If you're working on your own, open the\u00a0oysters\u00a0in advance and handle them carefully, so as not to spill the\u00a0liquor inside the shells, which combines with the melted butter to create a delicious, briny flavor. To make a whole meal out of them, serve them with some grilled bread and a simple salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tejal Rao"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/20/magazine/20eat1/20eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "anchovy, butter, hot sauce, oyster", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 102}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 901, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "60 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "58 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "32 grams", "sodiumContent": "959 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "2 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces butter", "3 tablespoons Crystal hot sauce", "1 small garlic clove", "1 lemon, zested, then cut into wedges", "1 anchovy", "48 oysters"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a food processor, combine butter, hot sauce, garlic, lemon zest and anchovy, and pulse until there are no streaks of hot sauce and the butter is a uniform shade of pale pink.

Push the tip of the oyster knife into the hinge, and twist so it cracks open. Make sure the knife is clean of shell and grit, then use it to release the top shell, and slide it under the oyster meat to release it from the bottom shell.
