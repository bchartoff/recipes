{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Persian-Spiced Lamb Shanks", "description": "Rare grilled lamb chops or a roasted leg of lamb can be delightful and are easy to cook if you\u2019re in a hurry. However, with a little planning, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s the shank of the lamb that deserves the most praise. Careful, slow simmering will coax lamb shanks to a flavorful succulence unlike the other cuts. Lamb shanks are versatile, too, easily adaptable to recipes from many different cuisines. This heady Persian spice mixture yields a braise that is complex and nuanced, yet the flavors are balanced, with subtle hints of orange, lime and rosewater. Basmati rice is the perfect accompaniment. Prepare the lamb shanks up to 2 days before serving, if desired. Refrigerate them covered in broth and reheat for 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven or over gentle heat on the stovetop.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/05/dining/05KITCHEN/5KITCHEN-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "middle eastern", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "chicken broth, lamb shanks, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 612}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 791, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "15 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "52 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "63 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "sodiumContent": "1403 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 meaty lamb shanks (ask for the hind shanks), about 4 1/2 to 5 pounds", "Salt", "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "1 teaspoon ground cardamom", "1 teaspoon ground dried rosebuds, optional", "1 teaspoon ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon turmeric", "Vegetable oil", "1/4 teaspoon crumbled saffron", "Juice of 2 limes, about 4 tablespoons", "3 teaspoons rosewater, available from Middle Eastern grocery shops", "1 large onion, roughly chopped", "1/2 teaspoon ground dried lime, or the zest of 1 fresh lime", "Zest of 1 orange, plus 1 tablespoon more for garnish", "A few thyme sprigs", "2 fresh bay leaves", "6 cups hot chicken broth or water", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley, for garnish", "2 tablespoons roughly chopped mint or dill, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Trim any excess fat from lamb shanks and season generously with salt.
