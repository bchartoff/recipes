{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Parippu Themparaduwa (Dal With Curry Leaves)", "description": "This Sri Lankan dal of tender lentils, like other dals on Sri Lankan tables, are central to every meal and usually served with several other dishes, such as <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022004-kukul-mas-maluwa-sri-lankan-chicken-curry\">kukul mas maluwa</a> (chicken curry). Because it is part of a larger meal, dal is often seasoned simply. This version is as well, but it is richer in taste from curry leaves, which infuse the lentils with their flavor. Dry or frozen curry leaves are fine substitutes if you can\u2019t find fresh ones. You can add some cumin or coriander powder, too, if you\u2019d like, or skip the Maldive fish flakes for a vegan dish. This dal is easy to cook and can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to three days. Serve with long-grain rice, bread or any of your favorite roti or other Indian flatbreads.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Zinara Rathnayake"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/18/dining/16CURRYLEAVES1/merlin_196269852_27fa9bd2-86cb-42c5-af44-cde545c4e71d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "weekday, beans, vegetables", "keywords": "curry leaves, masoor dal", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 146}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 cups masoor dal (red lentils)", "1 teaspoon ground turmeric", "1 teaspoon ground cayenne", "2 teaspoons Maldive fish flakes (optional; see Tip)", "3 tablespoons coconut oil", "20 fresh curry leaves, plucked off the stems (1/4 cup), or use dried or thawed frozen curry leaves", "1 small red onion, sliced thin", "6 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh ginger", "Salt", "Cooked rice or roti, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put masoor dal in a medium bowl, cover with water and rinse thoroughly.
