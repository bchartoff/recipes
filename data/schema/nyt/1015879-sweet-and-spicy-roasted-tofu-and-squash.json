{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sweet-and-Spicy Roasted Tofu and Squash", "description": "This is a meal with complex flavors and a variety of textures: velvety from the honey-roasted squash, tender and juicy from the tofu, with the occasional crunch from the sesame-seed garnish and a slight chew from the squash peel. I like to serve this dish with more hot sauce on the side, preferably over brown rice or lightly dressed baby spinach, though it\u2019s also good served all alone. As long as the squash and the tofu have each other, that\u2019s all they really need.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/08/dining/08DINNER_SPAN/08DINNER-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "main course, squash, tofu, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 470}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 315, "unsaturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "31 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "19 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "11 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "829 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained", "2 pounds dumpling, delicata or acorn squash, halved and seeded", "1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon sriracha or other hot sauce", "Kosher salt,  and black pepper", "1/4 cup peanut oil", "1 tablespoon honey", "1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds", "2 tablespoons chopped celery leaves or cilantro"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain tofu and slice into 1/2-inch-thick slabs.
