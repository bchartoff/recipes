{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Jim Harrison\u2019s Caribbean Stew", "description": "Jim Harrison, the poet and epicure, hunter and fisherman, novelist, essayist and enthusiastic cook, published a version of this recipe in the literary magazine Smoke Signals in 1981. I adapted it more than three decades later, after Harrison's death in 2016. The key ingredients: a lot of tomato paste and a good, floral hot sauce, ideally made with Scotch bonnet peppers, which combine in marvelous ways. Parboiling the ribs allows the recipe to come together relatively quickly, and the cooking otherwise is totally serial: one step after another until you slide the pot into the oven and allow the heat to do its work. Substitute different meats, or fewer, if you like, depending on availability.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02eat/02mag-02eat-t_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "caribbean", "recipeCategory": "soups and stews", "keywords": "chicken thigh, italian sausage, spare ribs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 579}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 882, "unsaturatedFatContent": "43 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "72 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "47 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "22 grams", "sodiumContent": "894 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds pork spareribs, cut into single ribs", "2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed", "4 chicken thighs, bone-in and skin-on", "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste", "4 Italian sausages, hot or sweet", "1 large yellow onion, peeled and sliced", "4 cloves of garlic, peeled and minced", "1/4 cup tomato paste", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon red-wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon lemon juice", "3 tablespoons hot-pepper sauce, ideally one made with Scotch bonnet peppers, or to taste", "1 cup chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium", "1/2 teaspoon white sugar", "4 dashes Worcestershire sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons chile powder", "1 1/2 teaspoons paprika"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place spareribs in a pot, and cover with water.
