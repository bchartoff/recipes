{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Fried Pole Beans With Chicken Liver Crostini", "description": "Pole beans, which are also called stick beans or runner beans depending on where you\u2019re from, are any sort of bean that climbs easily around a trellis or other support. When they are young, they are perfect cooked in a lightly oiled saut\u00e9 pan without blanching. Anne Quatrano\u2019s recipe requires only the discipline to keep the heat of the pan high enough so the beans brown well but don\u2019t burn. If the beans are fresh, they can achieve a crisp-tender state with just a touch of char in less than 10 minutes.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/16/dining/pole-bean-crostini/pole-bean-crostini-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads, finger foods", "keywords": "appetizer, chicken liver, crusty bread, pole beans, port, spring onion, summer", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 425, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "24 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "30 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "15 grams", "sodiumContent": "462 milligrams", "sugarContent": "8 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil", "2 shallots, diced", "2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced", "1 pound chicken livers, deveined", "1/2 cup port", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Sugar", "1 pound plus 1 tablespoon well-chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes", "1 pinch curing salt (to help preserve color), optional", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "1 pound assorted fresh pole beans (such as Dragon\u2019s Tongue, Romano, yellow), trimmed", "1 spring onion, thinly sliced", "1 clove garlic, thinly sliced", "Sea salt and cracked black pepper", "12 to 16 thin slices crusty bread", "Extra virgin olive oil"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "For chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9: In a medium saut\u00e9 pan, heat oil, and add shallots, garlic and chicken livers.
