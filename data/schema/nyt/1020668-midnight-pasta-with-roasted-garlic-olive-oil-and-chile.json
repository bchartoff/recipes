{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Midnight Pasta With Roasted Garlic, Olive Oil and Chile", "description": "This recipe is a version of aglio e olio pasta, which is often known as midnight pasta because it can be made quickly with a few pantry staples: garlic, olive oil, red-pepper flakes and pasta. This recipe takes a bit more time because it calls for roasting the garlic first, but doing so adds a complex, mellow flavor to the entire dish. If you\u2019re a planner, you could even roast a couple of heads of garlic in advance. (Roasted garlic will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks and in the freezer for up to two months.) Add whatever vegetables or proteins look good to you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/25/dining/as-Pasta-With-Caramelized-Garlic--Olive-Oil-and-Chile/merlin_161591019_30ca057a-225a-4635-a0ba-059da1d10806-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, pastas", "keywords": "garlic, olive oil, parsley, pasta, red pepper flakes, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 257}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large head of garlic", "Kosher salt", "1/2 cup plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 cup firmly packed parsley leaves", "1 pound spaghetti or other long pasta", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for garnish", "Black pepper", "Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
