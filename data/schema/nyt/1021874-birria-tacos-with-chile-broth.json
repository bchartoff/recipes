{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Birria Tacos With Chile Broth", "description": "Birria is one of Mexico\u2019s most beloved dishes, and eating it is a tradition, a way of life. A signature dish from Jalisco, it now extends through the entire country and north of the border. In this version from Oaxaca, goat or lamb is first marinated in vinegar to\u00a0moderate its gamey flavors, then it\u2019s cooked gently for so long that it falls apart. Guajillo chiles and aromatic avocado leaves coax delicate flavors from the meat and result in an intense, fragrant broth. The shredded meat is tucked into tacos here, but can also make its way into quesadillas and tortas. In every form, the meat tastes best garnished with chopped onion and cilantro, and chased with the broth mixed with a generous squeeze of fresh lime juice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/05/dining/pj-birria-tacos/merlin_183102915_7bdeedac-14e5-46f9-98fa-4024b16a535e-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, meat, soups and stews, tacos, main course", "keywords": "cilantro, corn tortillas, goat shoulder, guajillo chiles, lamb shoulder, lime", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 234}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 to 5 pounds bone-in goat or lamb shoulder, cut into 3-inch pieces", "1/4 cup distilled white vinegar", "6 teaspoons fine sea salt or coarse kosher salt, plus more to taste", "4 to 5 large dried avocado leaves", "3 ounces guajillo chiles (10 to 15), stemmed and seeded", "16 corn tortillas, warmed", "2 cups finely chopped white onion", "2 cups chopped cilantro leaves", "2 to 3 limes, cut into wedges"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the meat in a large bowl and cover with cold water.
