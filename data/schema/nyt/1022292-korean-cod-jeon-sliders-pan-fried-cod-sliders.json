The egg batter creates a delicate, tender coating, rather than a super crispy one. Typically served as a side dish with a soy dipping sauce, these cod pancakes are instead tucked into Hawaiian sweet rolls for kid-friendly fish sliders. They\u2019re great for entertaining, as the jeon can be cooked ahead and enjoyed at room temperature \u2014 just assemble the sandwiches right before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/15/dining/kc-cod-jeon-sliders/merlin_190773816_6c2d65be-0692-4ef6-bea3-4aac431a1752-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "8 sliders", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "sandwiches, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "cod, egg, mayonnaise", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 303}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce", "1 teaspoon white vinegar", "1 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil", "1/2 cup mayonnaise", "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1 large egg, beaten", "8 ounces center-cut cod fillet, cut crosswise on a diagonal into 8 (1/2-inch-thick) slices", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil", "2 scallions, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced on a diagonal (about 1/2 cup)", "1 packed cup tender baby greens (such as mesclun, oak or butter lettuce)", "8 Hawaiian sweet rolls, split", "Sliced dill pickles, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon of the sesame oil and mix well.
