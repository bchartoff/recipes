{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Marinated Chickpeas", "description": "These marinated chickpeas are great on their own, but even better for bulking up salads into a full meal. Because the chickpeas soak in vinaigrette, there\u2019s typically no need to add any extra dressing when you combine them with other vegetables; they come with enough seasoning to flavor everything. Combine a cup of the dressed chickpeas with a cup of cooked whole grains (such as farro, barley, wheat berries or quinoa), a half cup of shredded carrots, a handful of minced fresh parsley, a pinch of cumin, plus some cayenne or harissa for heat. You could also stir together equal parts marinated chickpeas and diced fresh cucumber with some slivered red onions and chopped fresh dill, or massage some chopped kale with olive oil and a pinch of salt, then toss in a big scoop of marinated chickpeas and some crumbled feta or Cotija.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.
