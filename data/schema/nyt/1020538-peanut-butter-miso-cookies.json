(The best things always are, aren\u2019t they?) When the peanut butter ran out, similarly creamy white miso stepped in.

A brief stint in the fridge helps mellow the miso\u2019s bracing brackishness, and a roll in Demerara sugar adds a subtle crunch that pairs well with the tender cookie.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Krysten Chambrot"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/dining/kc-miso-peanut-butter-cookies/merlin_162369633_695e5669-961b-4a3d-97b3-a3086043edd3-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "About 18 cookies", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cookies and bars", "keywords": "demerara sugar, miso, peanut butter, vanilla, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1082}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 3/4 cups/225 grams all-purpose flour", "3/4 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature", "1 cup/220 grams light brown sugar", "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar", "1/3 cup/80 milliliters white miso paste", "1/4 cup/60 milliliters chunky peanut butter", "1 large egg", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1/2 cup/105 grams Demerara sugar, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda and baking powder, and whisk until incorporated.
