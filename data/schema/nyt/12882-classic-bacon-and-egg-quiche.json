It is baked in a nine-and-a-half-inch fluted French tart pan, the sort with the removable bottom. The resulting quiche, as opposed to those baked in a deeper pie pan, stands only one inch high, and their relatively short baking time ensures a creamy, unctuous texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/29/dining/29COOKING1/29COOKING1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, dinner", "keywords": "bacon, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, eggs, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 153}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 285, "unsaturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "22 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "10 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "416 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Short-crust dough (<a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12884-basic-short-crust-pastry\" target=\"_blank\">see recipe</a>), rolled and chilled in a 9 1/2-inch tart pan", "3 large eggs", "3/4 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "1/2 cup milk", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "Black pepper, to taste", "About 1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg", "Pinch cayenne", "1/4 pound thick-cut bacon, sliced into 1/4-inch lardons", "2 ounces grated Gruy\u00e8re, optional"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bake chilled dough in a 9 1/2-inch tart pan at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned.
