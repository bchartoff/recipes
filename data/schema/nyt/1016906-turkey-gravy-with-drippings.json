{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Turkey Gravy With Drippings", "description": "Here is a simple, elegant pan gravy that lends itself well to cooking in the very pan in which you've roasted your turkey. It calls for whisking flour with the fat in the bottom of the pan to create a light roux (no lumps!), then hitting it with stock and wine, salt and pepper. Some may wish to add cream, or other spices. Decant the gravy into a warmed boat or beaker, rather than into a cold one, and serve immediately.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/26/dining/26COOKING-GRAVY3/26COOKING-GRAVY3-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "5 to 6 cups", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "sauces and gravies", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 466}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 245, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "13 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "17 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "5 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "517 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["7 tablespoons turkey fat, left in roasting pan", "6 tablespoons flour, preferably instant or all-purpose", "1/2 cup white wine", "4 to 5 cups turkey stock or chicken stock", "Kosher salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pour off all but 7 or so tablespoons turkey fat from the roasting pan, and set the pan on the stovetop over medium heat.
