{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mashed Sweet Potatoes With Roasted Garlic", "description": "There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t treat sweet potatoes like regular potatoes, meaning mashing them with butter, cream and lots of salt. Roasting sweet potatoes in the oven \u2014 individually wrapped in foil to help them steam \u2014 is not just a hands-off way to cook them by avoiding large pots of boiling water, it also concentrates their flavor. Roasted garlic is an easy addition here; since the potatoes already need an hour\u2019s worth of oven time, the garlic can cook alongside. The mellowed, caramelized garlic cloves are then smashed into the silky spuds, creating a minimalist yet rich and savory side dish. Make this the night before and reheat it in a buttered casserole dish in the oven \u2014 or even in the microwave \u2014 with a couple of extra pats of butter on top, right before eating.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/17/dining/15BEGINNERREX3-SWEETPOT/merlin_197340564_50ac981b-5e20-4326-a651-2949614a420d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 301}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large head of garlic", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and black pepper", "2 pounds sweet potatoes (see Tip)", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
