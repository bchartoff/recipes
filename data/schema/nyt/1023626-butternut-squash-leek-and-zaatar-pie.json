{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Butternut Squash, Leek and Za\u2019atar Pie", "description": "This comforting pie makes a great vegetarian centerpiece, ideal for a celebration. It benefits from being assembled the day before, receiving a good amount of time to set in the fridge and thus involving a lot less work on the day you plan to enjoy it. You can also bake the whole thing a few hours in advance, then just reheat it in the oven for 20 minutes, if you like. Use any extra pastry trim to cut out fun, festive shapes like holly leaves or stars to personalize your pie. Serve this alongside roasted veggies or a big leafy salad.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Yotam Ottolenghi"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/20/multimedia/25EAT-butternut-squash-pie-Alternate-1-f473/25EAT-butternut-squash-pie-Alternate-1-f473-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT4H", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, main course, side dish", "keywords": "butternut squash, cream cheese, feta, leek, make-ahead, party, puff pastry, savory pie, swiss chard, za'atar, fall, winter, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 762}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small (2-pound) butternut squash, peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces", "1 tablespoon maple syrup", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\u00a0", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Fine sea salt and black pepper", "1 large leek, trimmed, halved lengthwise, then thinly sliced crosswise", "8 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons za\u2019atar\u00a0", "\u00bc pound Swiss or rainbow chard, leaves and stems finely chopped (about 2 cups)", "3/4 cup/6 ounces cream cheese", "2/3 cup/3 1/2 ounces finely crumbled feta", "2 (14-ounce) sheets puff pastry", "1 large egg, beaten"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 400 degrees.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large bowl, mix together the butternut squash, maple syrup and cinnamon with 1 tablespoon oil and 1 teaspoon salt.
