{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Whole Wheat Bread, Apple and Cranberry Dressing", "description": "Having grown up with Pepperidge Farm stuffing, I will always have a weakness for bread stuffing seasoned with sage and thyme, with plenty of chopped onion and celery. I prefer to use 100 percent whole wheat bread, one that isn\u2019t at all sweet. A mixed grains bread would also work. The apple and cranberries contribute sweetness, tartness and texture to the classic dressing. I bake this in a gratin dish; you can double the recipe if you want to use it for a stuffing as well, and put half inside the bird. But, moistened with a well seasoned vegetable stock, the dressing makes a great vegetarian side dish. Just be sure to use plenty of stock to moisten, as the problem with most stuffings that are baked outside the bird is that they are dry. Tender apples like McIntosh, Gala, Macoun and Cortland work well in this dish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/18/science/18recipehealthstuffing/18recipehealthstuffing-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "fall, winter, halal, kosher, nut-free, vegetarian, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 5}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 207, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "28 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "6 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "329 milligrams", "sugarContent": "11 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 to 9 ounces whole wheat bread (with crusts), cut into 3/4 to 1-inch cubes (4 to 5 cups)", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 medium or large onion, finely chopped", "2 stalks celery, diced", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "1 large apple, peeled and diced", "1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley", "2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme", "1 tablespoon minced fresh sage or 1 teaspoon rubbed dried sage", "1/2 cup dried cranberries", "1 egg", "1 cup chicken or vegetable stock", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
