{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Youvarlakia Avgolemono (Lemony Greek Meatball Soup)", "description": "Avgolemono is a Greek egg and lemon mixture that\u2019s tangy and silky, and used to thicken sauces and soups. In the United States, most versions of avgolemono soup brim with grains of rice and chunks of chicken. In this recipe,\u00a0a riff on youvarlakia avgolemono, ground chicken and rice are rolled into meatballs, then simmered in the broth, making the whole thing heartier without losing the soup\u2019s characteristic brightness. Many recipes for youvarlakia\u00a0call for ground beef, and, if you like you can substitute that here. Note that because of the eggs in the broth, leftovers do not freeze well.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/25/dining/25apperex/merlin_202627539_ff884f2c-0aec-4bfa-baab-1d0eacab589a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, meatballs, main course", "keywords": "dill, ground beef, ground chicken, ground turkey, lemon juice, parsley, soup", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1266}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound ground chicken (or ground turkey or beef), very cold", "3/4 cup chopped fresh dill or parsley, plus more for garnish", "1/2 cup grated yellow onion (from about 1 small onion)", "1/4 cup grated carrot (from about 1 carrot)", "1/4 cup uncooked long-grain rice, such as basmati or Carolina, well rinsed and drained", "1 garlic clove, finely grated, pushed through a garlic press, or minced", "1 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "6 cups chicken stock", "2 large eggs, at room temperature", "1/3 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 2 lemons)", "Freshly grated nutmeg, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large mixing bowl, combine ground chicken, 1/4 cup dill, onion, carrot, rice, garlic, salt, pepper and lemon zest.
