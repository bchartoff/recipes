{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Hot and Sour Seared Tofu With Sugar Snap Peas", "description": "Impatience was the main reason I failed at searing tofu. For years, I had given in to the temptation to poke it, turn it, examine it, annoy it. Then I finally learned that, like any very moist ingredient (fish, mushrooms, tomatoes), the less you bother it, the browner and crisper it will get.\n\nOnce I figured that out, searing tofu was easy. These days it\u2019s a fixture in our something-quick-for-dinner arsenal. In this recipe, I stir-fry it with sliced sugar snap peas. But any vegetable cut into small pieces (asparagus, mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini, green beans) works well, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/28/dining/dj-dinner/dj-dinner-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 3 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick", "keywords": "main course, sugar snap peas, tofu", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 395}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 228, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "14 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "697 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu", "4 large garlic cloves, grated", "2 small jalape\u00f1o chiles, seeds and veins removed if desired, thinly sliced", "1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons grated ginger root", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, more to taste", "1 1/2 teaspoon toasted (Asian) sesame oil, more for drizzling", "1 1/2 teaspoons Asian fish sauce", "1 teaspoon honey", "2 tablespoons peanut oil, more if needed", "6 ounces sugar snap peas, trimmed and thinly sliced", "3 scallions, thinly sliced", "Sesame seeds, for serving", "Cooked rice, for serving", "Chopped cilantro or basil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Drain tofu, wrap it with a clean dish towel or several layers of paper towels and place on a rimmed plate; top with another plate and a weight (a can works).
