The hot, boiled dressing softens the cabbage and pickles it slightly. The result is a salad that stays delicious even when it sits outside on a picnic table for a few hours. The amount of vegetables can vary, and a finely chopped jalape\u00f1o can be added for a little extra heat.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/01/dining/01BOIL5/01BOIL5-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "salads and dressings", "keywords": "cabbage, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 186}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 144, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "2 grams", "sodiumContent": "208 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 cups chopped green cabbage (\u00bd-inch pieces)", "2 cups chopped purple cabbage (\u00bd-inch pieces)", "1/2 heaping cup chopped Vidalia or other sweet onion", "1/2 cup finely diced carrot", "1/2 cup finely diced red bell or other sweet pepper", "1 large clove garlic", "1/2 tablespoon salt, more to taste", "1 tablespoon minced ginger", "1/3 cup rice wine vinegar", "1/2 cup olive oil", "Juice of 1 freshly squeezed lime", "Salt and freshly ground pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the slaw: Put the chopped and diced vegetables in a bowl or other container that will fit in the refrigerator."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the dressing: Crush the garlic, and with the side of a knife work the salt into the clove until it makes a rough paste.
