{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oven-Braised Guinness Beef Stew With Horseradish Cream", "description": "Classic beef stew is good, but this sophisticated beef stew \u2014 enriched with beer, cocoa powder and espresso \u2014 is really something special. Start by browning the beef and making a quick roux to guarantee a thick, flavorful stew instead of a watery, bland soup, and finish with hit of balsamic vinegar and lemon juice to balance out the rich, round notes. Dried shiitake mushrooms provide another layer of complexity, but if you can\u2019t find them, leave them out. The stew will still be delicious. Top big bowls of it with swirls of tangy horseradish cream.
