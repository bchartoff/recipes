{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Curry-Laced Moules \u00e0 la Marini\u00e8re With Fresh Peas", "description": "It\u2019s important to buy mussels from a reputable fishmonger. If mussels are not properly stored, they die, and a dead mussel can make you very sick. Look for mussels that are shiny and black, and somewhat heavy. Once home, take them out of the wrapping immediately, give them a quick rinse and put them in a big bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and refrigerate until you\u2019re ready to clean and cook them. The main work that goes into cooking mussels is the careful picking over that must be done first, to make sure there are no dead mussels. Rinse the mussels in several times in cold water and examine each one. If there are cracks in the shell, or if a mussel is open and doesn\u2019t close back up when you tap the shell, throw it away. If the shells have lots of algae, seaweed or barnacles on them, you can brush them or scrape them with the edge of the shell of another mussel. Finally, pull out the beards. This should not be done until shortly before cooking as mussels can die once the beards have been pulled. Discard any that remain closed after cooking.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/30/health/nutrition/30recipehealth/30recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 main-course servings", "recipeCuisine": "french", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "dry white wine, mussels, peas, gluten-free, healthy, nut-free, main course", "aggregateRating": null, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 542, "unsaturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "29 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "15 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "51 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "5 grams", "sodiumContent": "1149 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 1/2 pounds black mussels", "1 to 1 1/2 cups freshly shelled peas", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 small onion or 2 to 4 shallots, minced", "1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder (more to taste)", "2 cups dry white wine", "2 to 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed", "4 sprigs fresh parsley", "2 sprigs fresh thyme", "1 small bay leaf", "6 whole peppercorns", "3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Clean the mussels.
