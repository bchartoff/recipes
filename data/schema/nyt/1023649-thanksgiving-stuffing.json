{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Thanksgiving Stuffing", "description": "This deeply savory, buttery sage stuffing builds layers of flavor with each step. First, whole sage leaves fry in melted butter for a pretty garnish that offers pleasurable crispy bits. The butter ends up browned, nutty and infused with the herb\u2019s woodsy aroma, and helps chopped sage, fennel seeds, poultry seasoning and cayenne bloom for a fragrant blend that tastes like sausage. Milk in place of watery boxed stock means there\u2019s a base of richness that only dairy can provide. The combination of white bread and cornbread results in a classic but amped-up Thanksgiving stuffing with textural integrity and a hint of sweetness to boot.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eric Kim"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/15STUFFINGREX-thanksgiving-stuffing/14STUFFINGREX-thanksgiving-stuffing-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H20M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, side dish", "keywords": "brown butter, cornbread, fennel seeds, milk, sage, sourdough, stuffing and dressing, fall, winter, thanksgiving, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2670}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 ounces crusty white bread, such as country loaf or sourdough, cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 6 cups)", "8 ounces store-bought or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022722-cornbread\">homemade cornbread</a>, cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 3 cups)", "1/2 cup unsalted butter", "10 fresh sage leaves, plus 1/3 cup coarsely chopped sage (3/4 ounce)", "1 tablespoon fennel seeds", "1 teaspoon salt-free poultry seasoning", "1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne", "1 large yellow onion, finely diced", "Salt and black pepper", "2 celery stalks, finely diced", "2 cups whole milk, plus more as needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
