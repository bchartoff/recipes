They\u2019re immensely popular in Mexico City, where they\u2019re prepared using long corn tortillas specifically made for the dish. This faster version uses standard corn tortillas and a quick rotisserie chicken filling, but the tomatillo sauce, which is tart with an underlying sweetness, deserves to be made from scratch. Prepare it a day in advance or freeze it to save time. It\u2019s worth making a double batch of the sauce, because it brightens up just about anything: tacos, quesadillas or eggs.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lesley T\u00e9llez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/03/dining/lt-flautas/lt-flautas-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry", "keywords": "chicken, cilantro, cotija, serrano chili, tomatillo, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 99}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small white onion, peeled", "1 pound tomatillos, husked and rinsed", "2 serrano chiles", "1 large garlic clove, peeled", "2 cups shredded white and dark meat (about 10 ounces) from half a rotisserie chicken", "3/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano", "Kosher salt and ground pepper", "1 tablespoon canola oil, plus about 2 cups for frying", "12 corn tortillas", "1/2 cup <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018885-crema\">Mexican crema</a>", "3/4 cup crumbled cotija cheese (about 4 ounces)", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves and stems"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Fill a large saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil over high.
