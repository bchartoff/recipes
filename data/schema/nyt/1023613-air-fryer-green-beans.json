Green beans will crisp up nicely if left undisturbed in the air fryer, but like an oven, an air fryer can contain hot spots, so it\u2019s worth shaking the green beans at least once for even cooking.\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eleanore Park"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/02/dining/ep-air-fryer-green-beans/ep-air-fryer-green-beans-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "2 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, for two, quick, weeknight, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "air fryer, balsamic vinegar, green bean, red pepper flake, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 265}, "recipeIngredient": ["\u00bd pound green beans, trimmed", "1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "2 garlic cloves, finely grated", "Salt\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-fryer/'>air fryer</a> to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "\u00a0 In a medium bowl, combine the green beans, vinegar, olive oil, red-pepper flakes and garlic.
