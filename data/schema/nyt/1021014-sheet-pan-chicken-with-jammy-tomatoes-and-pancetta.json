{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Jammy Tomatoes and Pancetta", "description": "In this relatively speedy sheet-pan dinner, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are seasoned with a savory, cumin-scented spice mix and roasted with whole garlic cloves and cherry tomatoes, which turn soft and sweet in the oven\u2019s heat. If you have ripe summer cherry tomatoes, you can skip the brown sugar. If you\u2019d rather use boneless chicken breasts, reduce the cooking time by about 5 to 7 minutes. This makes a light meal on its own, but you can add rice or crusty bread, and maybe a salad, if you need something more substantial.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/22/dining/17apperex/merlin_171456828_52e65cdf-88f0-49a7-b6db-b03ea2387096-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, poultry, main course", "keywords": "bacon, cherry tomatoes, chicken thigh, paprika", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 3578}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed", "9 whole unpeeled garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling", "1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon sweet or smoked paprika", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon brown sugar (optional)", "3/4 teaspoon ground cumin", "1 pint cherry tomatoes (preferably different colors), halved", "2 ounces diced pancetta or bacon", "1/4 cup torn fresh dill, parsley or other herbs, for serving", "Freshly ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 425 degrees.
