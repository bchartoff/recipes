The base needs to sit overnight, and the shrub, once it\u2019s all put together, mellows and changes with more time in the refrigerator. Herbs, peppercorns and vegetables can be added to the basic formula to create endless variations. Other vinegars may be substituted. When in doubt, apple cider vinegar is a good fall back.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20SHRUB/20SHRUB-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT10M", "recipeYield": "About 1 1/2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "project", "keywords": "plum, sugar, white wine vinegar, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 102}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 205, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "50 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "1 gram", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "1 milligram", "sugarContent": "49 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound unpeeled but pitted and chopped plums, apricots, peaches or other fruit", "3/4 cup sugar", "3/4 cup white wine vinegar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Mix fruit and sugar in a glass or other nonplastic bowl, breaking apart or mashing the fruit to bring out its juices.
