{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Apricot Tart With Pistachios", "description": "Working with phyllo dough is easy and satisfying, especially for cooks who are inclined to shy away from making pastry. Frozen puff pastry is having a moment, but for little effort, you can achieve similar results with phyllo sheets and never lift a rolling pin. Bright orange apricots are the ideal fruit, but other summer stone fruits, such as pluots, plums or nectarines, also work well. This makes a very impressive open face tart with a very crisp, ultraflaky crust.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/07/dining/02Tanisrex3-Tart/02Tanisrex3-Tart-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts, dessert", "keywords": "apricot, phyllo, pistachio, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 314}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (16-ounce) package phyllo sheets, thawed (about 18 sheets)", "3/4 cup melted butter", "1 cup/320 grams best-quality apricot jam, or use orange marmalade", "1/2 cup/50 grams chopped pistachios or walnuts", "8 large apricots (1 1/2 pounds/680 grams), halved, pitted and cut into 6 wedges each (about 3 cups)", "1/3 cup/67 grams granulated sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 375 degrees.
