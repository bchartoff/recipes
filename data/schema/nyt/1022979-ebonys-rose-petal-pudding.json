{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ebony\u2019s Rose Petal Pudding", "description": "Freda DeKnight introduced many signature dishes to Ebony magazine in the mid-20th century. One was her rose petal pudding, which was beloved by Ebony staffers and readers alike. Although its origin story is unclear, it\u2019s likely that Ms. DeKnight, the magazine\u2019s food editor and a frequent traveler, created the dessert from her research and willingness to incorporate international flavors into her cooking. This warm pudding provides a sweet taste of one of the most significant culinary periods in the nation. The rose icing is divine, and the aromatic pudding, which resembles bread pudding, is really lovely. The original recipe calls for 1/4 cup of rose water, which will give the pudding a very pronounced floral flavor, so you can choose an amount that is pleasing to you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kayla Stewart"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/23/dining/18EBONYREX1-rose-petal-pudding/merlin_202238124_3c4a96ac-aeb7-47d5-af04-4c47e4594edf-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H30M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "custards and puddings, dessert", "keywords": "almond, rose petals, white bread, mother\u2019s day", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 272}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 tablespoons/143 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the mold", "6 slices/242 grams white bread, toasted and finely ground (about 3 cups)\u00a0", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "1 1/2 cups/226 grams almonds, finely ground or 2 1/4 cups/226 grams almond flour", "1 tablespoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon fine salt", "1/2 teaspoon ground mace", "1/4 packed cup/4 grams dried edible small rose petals, picked over for stems\u00a0", "3 large eggs", "3/4 cup whole milk", "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice", "1 tablespoon rose water, plus more if desired", "2 cups/225 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar", "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter, melted", "1/4 cup/87 grams currant jelly or seedless raspberry jam", "1/2 teaspoon ground mace", "1 teaspoon rose water", "2 tablespoons whole milk or cream, plus more as needed", "Crystallized rose petals, for garnish (optional; see Tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the pudding: Butter a 7- to 8-cup heatproof pudding mold or other deep baking dish or bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Meanwhile, combine the bread crumbs, sugar, almonds, baking powder, salt, mace and rose petals in a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer.
