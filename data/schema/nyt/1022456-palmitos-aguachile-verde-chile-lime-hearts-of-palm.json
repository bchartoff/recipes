Aguachile, which is a Sinaloa-style ceviche, is made here with serrano chiles and an abundance of lime juice. That combination works perfectly with delicate palmitos, hearts of palm, that have a just-right balance in texture between creaminess and firmness. Pick up the nori sheets in the snack aisle to add just a bit of saltiness that replicates the briny ocean flavors of seafood-based aguachiles. Serve in a bowl with a generous side of tostadas or tortilla chips \u2014 and don\u2019t forget the <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/8456-michelada\">micheladas</a>.\n \nTo get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/the-veggie\">sign up for The Veggie newsletter</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Jocelyn Ramirez"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/10/dining/jr-palmitos/merlin_192666543_df57be8f-f939-47f4-8d7b-1bc6194559ef-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "vegetables, appetizer, main course", "keywords": "hearts of palm, lime juice, serrano pepper, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 322}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (28-ounce) can whole hearts of palm, drained and cut into 1/4-inch coins", "1/2 medium red onion, thinly sliced lengthwise", "1 Persian or 1/2 English cucumber, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced", "1 medium ripe Hass avocado, pitted, peeled and thinly sliced crosswise", "4 small serrano chiles, stemmed and seeded if you\u2019d like, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped", "1 cup fresh lime juice (from about 12 limes)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "5 snack-size nori sheets (optional)", "Coarse sea salt, to taste", "Tortilla chips or tostadas, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the hearts of palm, red onion, cucumber and avocado in a large bowl and gently toss together."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Combine the serrano chiles, cilantro, lime juice, olive oil, nori sheets (if using), and a pinch of salt in a blender and blend until completely smooth.
