Created by nuns in Puebla in 1821, the dish was presented to the general of the Mexican Army, Agust\u00edn de Iturbide, after he signing the treaty that recognized Mexico\u2019s independence from Spain. The nuns used the best of the late-season harvest in the dish, including poblano chiles, peaches, pears, apples and walnuts grown in farms near Puebla. The original dish was stuffed, battered and fried, and significantly heartier than this version. Here, fresh poblanos are fried until lightly cooked, peeled, stuffed, topped with creamy walnut sauce, then eaten at room temperature. It\u2019s served throughout the country every September, in honor of Mexico\u2019s Independence Day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Rick A.
