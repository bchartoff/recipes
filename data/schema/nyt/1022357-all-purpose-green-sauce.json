You can use any combination of soft herbs here; you\u2019ll need two packed cups altogether. And you don\u2019t have to limit yourself to herbs. Other flavorful, leafy options include arugula, celery leaves or pea shoots. For a vegan version, skip the yogurt and use more olive oil, along with a small squeeze of lemon for some acidity.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/07/12/dining/12SAUCESREX2-Green-MC-all-purpose-green-herb-sauce/merlin_190354161_c1d1b691-9208-4b7d-aab1-9b7574daa54d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "About 2 cups", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "easy, quick, sauces and gravies", "keywords": "basil, chives, greek yogurt, parsley, sour cream", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 876}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 packed cup basil leaves", "1/2 packed cup parsley leaves and tender stems", "1/2 packed cup chopped chives", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed", "Pinch of black pepper", "1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt or sour cream", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place herbs, garlic and pepper in a food processor or blender, and pulse to combine, stopping to scrape down the sides of the container if necessary."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add yogurt and pur\u00e9e until smooth.
