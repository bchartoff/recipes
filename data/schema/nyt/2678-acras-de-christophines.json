Alternatively, set the temperature on a deep fryer to 375 degrees. Drop one teaspoon of batter into the hot oil and fry until golden (about one-and-one-half to two minutes). Drain on paper towels and taste. Correct seasoning with additional cayenne, if desired. Continue to fry as many spoonfuls at a time as fat will hold without touching in one layer until all the batter has been used. Be sure to maintain oil temperature. If desired, the fritters may be fried several hours in advance and recrisped in a 400-degree oven for five to seven minutes, or until heated through and crisp."}]}
