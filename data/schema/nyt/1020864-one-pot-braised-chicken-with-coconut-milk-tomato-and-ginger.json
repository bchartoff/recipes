{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Pot Braised Chicken With Coconut Milk, Tomato and Ginger", "description": "Bone-in chicken thighs are a favorite go-to for weeknight meals, as they cook relatively quickly, are versatile and impart a lot of flavor in a short amount of time. Here, they are browned, then braised in a fragrant tomato-coconut broth flecked with ginger, garlic, cumin and cinnamon. The result is a rich, stew-like dish, which works nicely served over white rice. By cooking the rice as the chicken finishes braising, you can get everything on the table at the same time. A good squeeze of lime is not required, but it does give the dish a bright finish. Serve any remaining sauce at the table, with crusty bread for sopping.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Colu Henry"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/dining/ch-tomato-and-coconut-braised-chicken/merlin_166828545_50e59496-f715-4d3a-a58e-4d03df861168-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weeknight, poultry", "keywords": "chicken thigh, coconut milk, ginger, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1583}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/2 to 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, at room temperature", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil", "1 medium red onion, thinly sliced", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped", "1 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes", "1 (14-ounce) can cherry or diced tomatoes with their juices", "1 (13-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk", "Steamed white rice, for serving (optional)", "3 tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro", "1 lime, quartered, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken thighs dry and season with salt and pepper.
