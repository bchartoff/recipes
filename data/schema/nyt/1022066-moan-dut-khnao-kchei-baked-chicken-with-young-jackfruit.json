If you\u2019re in the U.S., you may need to call around to your local South Asian and Chinese grocers to find young jackfruit. But once you have your ingredients, you mostly just need to chop to get this Cambodian dinner on the table. The chef Rotanak Ros, the author of \u201cNhum: Recipes from a Cambodian Kitchen\u201d (Rotanak Food Media, 2019), said this dish was a special one: \u201cPeople raise chickens to sell, not to eat,\u201d she said, speaking of villages where she conducts research. \u201cThe money from one chicken can feed the whole family, at least, for three days.\u201d To kill a chicken, then, is to honor a guest.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amelia Nierenberg"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/14/dining/12Cambodian-bookrex1/merlin_184316640_51f632c8-da57-43b0-ac79-7f2cd478c859-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, poultry, salads and dressings, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "black peppercorns, chicken, jackfruit, lemongrass, fall, spring, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 13}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons soy sauce", "1 1/2 teaspoons palm sugar (or brown sugar)", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 whole (4- to 5-pound) free-range chicken", "1 (4-pound) young jackfruit (or 1/2 pound brussels sprouts; see Tip)", "1 cup canola oil or other neutral cooking oil", "2 lemongrass stalks (optional), base and tips trimmed, stalks cut into 3-inch segments", "10 fresh makrut lime leaves", "1 to 3 fresh red or bird\u2019s-eye chiles, finely chopped", "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped", "2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar", "2 tablespoons fish sauce", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 tablespoon minced shallots (optional)", "1 tablespoon minced lemongrass (optional)", "1 tablespoon whole black Kampot peppercorns", "1 1/2 tablespoons sea salt", "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice", "Lettuce leaves", "Mint leaves", "Thai basil", "1 cucumber"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the chicken: In a large bowl, whisk soy sauce, palm sugar and salt until dissolved.
