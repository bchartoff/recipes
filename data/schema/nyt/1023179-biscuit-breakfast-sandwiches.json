Nice and hot, it\u2019s pure joy with a cup of coffee. Crunchy brown tops give way to tender, buttery bread in these biscuits, which cradle fluffy scrambled eggs draped with melted cheese. Whether you slip in some bacon, sausage or ham is up to you, but you definitely want to slather <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023180-quick-raspberry-jam\">jam</a> all over the biscuits. It\u2019s a salty-sweet combination inspired by the chef Jonathan Whitener and the pastry director Thessa Diadem of All Day Baby, a restaurant in Los Angeles, where they make thousands of biscuit sandwiches each week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/18/dining/13Korex-sandwich/13Korex-sandwich-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 sandwiches", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, sandwiches, main course", "keywords": "egg, flour, jam", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 265}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons/84 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus more for greasing the pan", "1 1/2 cups/208 grams all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons granulated sugar", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1 teaspoon fine salt", "2/3 cup/167 grams cold whole milk", "6 large eggs", "Salt and pepper", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "4 slices American cheese", "<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023180-quick-raspberry-jam\">Quick Raspberry Jam</a> or store-bought raspberry or strawberry jam, for spreading", "Cooked bacon, breakfast sausage patties or ham (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the biscuits: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees.
