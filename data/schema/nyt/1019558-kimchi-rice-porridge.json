{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kimchi Rice Porridge", "description": "A combination of pungent chopped kimchi, toasted scallions and ginger, and rice that's been bolstered with a hit of kimchi brine, this porridge is fiery and sinus-clearing. The rice isn\u2019t perfectly fluffy; instead, leftover rice simmers until it breaks down from kernel to stew. (You can, of course, use raw rice, too: Cook it in Step 2 for about an hour, partly covered and stirring occasionally.) You'll want to cook the scallions and ginger until nearly burned, and top the whole thing with a fried egg (or make it soft-boiled). Take note that most kimchi gets its funk from shrimp, anchovies and-or fish sauce, so if you\u2019d like to make this dish vegetarian, make sure to use a vegetarian kimchi.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/13/dining/AS-kimchi-porridge-horizontal/AS-kimchi-porridge-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, brunch, dinner, lunch, weekday, grains and rice", "keywords": "ginger, kimchi, scallion, sesame oil, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 169}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 390, "unsaturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "79 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "4 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "7 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "285 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon vegetable oil", "6 scallions (about 1 bunch), white and pale green parts roughly chopped, plus more for garnish", "2 tablespoons peeled and finely minced ginger", "1/2 cup chopped kimchi, plus 1 tablespoon kimchi brine", "2 cups cooked long- or short-grain rice", "Kosher salt, to taste", "4 eggs, for serving", "Toasted sesame oil, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
