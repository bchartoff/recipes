{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Five-Peppercorn Fish Fillets", "description": "Firm white-fleshed fish fillets, like halibut, striped bass or grouper, take well to this simple, peppery butter sauce. A mix of different peppercorns \u2014 black, green, rose, Sichuan and Timut (from Nepal) \u2014 crushed to release their flavor and aroma, creates a seasoning that is sweet and spicy, but not \"hot.\" The Sichuan and Timut pepper are quite floral and have a somewhat tongue-numbing quality. Most spice merchants will offer many kinds; feel free to use just one or two, or to refine the mixture to your own taste.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/19/dining/19FISH/19FISH-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, seafood", "keywords": "halibut, sage, sichuan peppercorns, timut peppercorns, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 143}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 344, "unsaturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "4 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "22 grams", "fiberContent": "2 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "469 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 teaspoon black Tellicherry peppercorns", "1 teaspoon dried whole green peppercorns", "1 teaspoon rose (pink) peppercorns", "1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns", "1 teaspoon Timut peppercorns", "4 tablespoons unsalted butter", "12 fresh sage leaves", "Salt", "4 boneless halibut, sea bass or grouper fillets, about 6 ounces each", "All-purpose flour, for dusting", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1/2 teaspoon lemon zest or lime zest", "1 tablespoon lemon juice or lime juice", "Tender parsley or watercress sprigs, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put all the peppercorns in a small dry skillet over medium heat.
