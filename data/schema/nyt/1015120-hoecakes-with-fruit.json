Combine cornmeal and salt in a medium bowl. Gradually pour in boiling water, whisking constantly. Let mixture sit until cornmeal absorbs water, 5 to 10 minutes.

When a few drops of water dance on the surface, add a thin film of remaining oil. Working in batches, spoon in batter, making any size cakes you like; they will be thinner than pancakes. Cook until bubbles appear and burst on the tops, and the undersides are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes; turn and cook on other side until golden, another 2 or 3 minutes. Transfer to warm oven and continue with next batch, adding more oil to skillet if necessary. Serve warm with syrup, jam or compote. "}]}
