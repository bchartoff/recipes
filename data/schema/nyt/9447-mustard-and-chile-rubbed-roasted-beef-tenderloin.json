{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Mustard-and-Chile-Rubbed Roasted Beef Tenderloin", "description": "For parties or picnics, meat that you've prepared the day before is a time-saving trick worth adopting. Everyone knows that beef tenderloin, served hot, is a fail-safe dish for a dinner party. It comes out of the oven caramelized, glistening and perfect. If the primary goal is to serve it chilled or room temperature, however, the trick is to swab the meat with flavor \u2014 lots of chile powder, oregano, garlic, mustard and olive oil \u2014 before sliding it into the oven (roast it rare so it stays tender and juicy). The next day all you need to do is slice and serve, no compensatory condiments necessary. The flavors of mustard and chile, carried by the fat in the olive oil, have penetrated the meat beautifully.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/05/dining/05COOKING-BEEF-TENDERLOIN2/05COOKING-BEEF-TENDERLOIN2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "beef tenderloin, chile powder, dijon mustard, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 241}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 427, "unsaturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "33 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "29 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "12 grams", "sodiumContent": "378 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 2-pound beef tenderloin, trimmed, rinsed and patted dry", "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard", "1 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 teaspoon chipotle chile powder", "1/2 teaspoon chile powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 large garlic clove, passed through a garlic press", "Kosher salt, to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
