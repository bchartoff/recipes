{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Air-Fryer Potatoes", "description": "The air fryer creates crispy, tender potatoes without having to parboil beforehand, cutting much of the cooking time. Thanks to the compact space of the air fryer, the circulated high heat blisters the skins, creating crunchy edges, but also steams the potatoes, resulting in creamy centers. These potatoes taste as if they had been slow roasted over a long period of time, but cook in about 15 minutes. If dried parsley is unavailable, or you prefer fresh herbs, the recipe works just as well by tossing the potatoes with a tablespoon of freshly chopped parsley along with the lemon zest before serving.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Eleanore Park"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/15/dining/ep-air-fryer-potatoes/ep-air-fryer-potatoes-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "2 to 4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "air fryer, dijon mustard, lemon zest, new potato, quick, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 182}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "3/4 teaspoon dried parsley (or chopped fresh parsley, for garnish)", "1/2 teaspoon garlic salt", "1 pound baby potatoes, cut into 3/4- to 1-inch chunks", "1 teaspoon lemon zest\u00a0"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat air fryer to 400 degrees, if preheating is necessary.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "\u00a0 In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, mustard, dried parsley and garlic salt.
