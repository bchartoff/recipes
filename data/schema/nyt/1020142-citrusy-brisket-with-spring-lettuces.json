{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Citrusy Brisket With Spring Lettuces", "description": "This is a bright, zesty take on braised brisket, in which the meat is cooked with lemon and orange juice, along with plenty of onions and dry white wine. It makes for a lighter-tasting sauce than the standard rich, brown gravy, with a tangy, citrus flavor. For serving, the tender slices of meat are topped with a crisp herb salad, adding even more freshness to the plate. Serve it with mashed or roasted potatoes to soak up all the caramelized, oniony juices.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/dining/05appe1/05appe1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, meat", "keywords": "brisket, endive, lemon, lettuce, orange, radicchio, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 187}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 663, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "53 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "32 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "670 milligrams", "sugarContent": "5 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) beef brisket", "2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "4 teaspoons finely grated garlic (from about 5 large cloves)", "1 tablespoon chopped thyme leaves", "1 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves", "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus\u00a0more for serving", "2 large white onions, halved and thinly sliced", "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest", "1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest", "Juice from 2 lemons", "Juice from 2 oranges", "1 cup dry white wine", "1 garlic clove, finely grated or minced", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste", "4 cups spring lettuces or baby spinach", "2 cups sliced endive (from 2 to 3 endives)", "1 small head radicchio, sliced\u00a0(about 2 cups)", "1 cup mixed soft herbs (leaves and tender stems), such as dill, basil or tarragon"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season the brisket all over with salt and pepper, then rub the meat with 2 teaspoons grated garlic, thyme and rosemary.
