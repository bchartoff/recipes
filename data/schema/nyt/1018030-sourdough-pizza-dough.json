But if not, give the starter a feed of flour and water a few hours before you mix up the dough. (If you need to <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013152-sourdough-starter\">start a starter</a>, add a week or so to the process.) \u201cIt\u2019s a little more complicated\u201d than a regular dough, said Anthony Falco, who runs the pizza operations at Roberta\u2019s, \u201cbut, oh boy, the end result is worth it.\u201d", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/23/dining/23JPSOURDOUGH2/23JPSOURDOUGH2-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT30M", "recipeYield": "3 pizzas", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breads, pizza and calzones", "keywords": "00 flour, sourdough starter, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 307}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 561, "unsaturatedFatContent": "4 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "109 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "6 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "16 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "361 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["5 cups/500 grams 00 flour", "2 1/2 teaspoons/15 grams kosher salt", "2 1/2 teaspoons/7.5 grams instant dry yeast", "1 tablespoon/15 grams extra-virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons/90 grams <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013152-sourdough-starter\">sourdough starter</a>, \u201cfed\u201d"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a small mixing bowl, stir together 300 grams (about 1 1/4 cups) lukewarm tap water, the instant dry yeast and the olive oil, then stir the sourdough starter into it and pour it into the bowl with the flour mixture.
