{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spaghetti Squash With Garlic, Parsley and Breadcrumbs", "description": "Spaghetti squash gets its name from the fact that once it is cooked, the flesh breaks down into long spaghettilike strands. I find spaghetti squash a bit dull on its own, as it does not have the sweetness and depth of many other winter squash. But it is hard to resist substituting spaghetti squash for pasta every once in a while, and the squash will pick up other robust flavors in the dish. Most spaghetti squash are pretty large; you will need only half of a 3 to 3 1/2-pound squash for this recipe. You can toss the leftovers with tomato sauce the next day.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/11/10/health/nutrition/10recipehealth/10recipehealth-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H30M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy", "keywords": "dairy-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low cholesterol, low-sodium, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian, fall, summer, spaghetti squash", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 361}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 spaghetti squash, about 3 pounds", "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "3 to 4 large garlic cloves, green shoots removed, minced", "2 tablespoons breadcrumbs", "2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley", "Salt", "freshly ground pepper to taste", "Freshly grated Parmesan"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
