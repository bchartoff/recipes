{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chap Chye (Braised Cabbage and Mushrooms)", "description": "A hearty plate of chopped cabbage, shiitake mushrooms and carrots stewed in aromatics, chap chye is ubiquitous on the Lunar New Year table in Singapore, though every family has a different way of making it depending on its heritage. This recipe comes from Darren Ho, a Singaporean chef of Teochew, Hainanese, Cantonese and Peranakan descent. Other cooks like adding cubes of pork for flavor, lily buds for texture and a heaping of black moss fungus on top because its Cantonese name \u2014 fat choy \u2014 is a homophone for good luck. Mr. Ho flavors his vegan version with fermented bean paste and bean curd cubes, which lend distinct creamy undertones. Serve with white rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Clarissa Wei"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/01/26/dining/21SINGAPOREREX5-chap-chye-braised-cabbage/merlin_200287683_49340b98-806f-4afc-96a3-e1a36e1e65fd-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H15M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 270}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 large dried shiitake mushrooms", "8 large or 16 small dried wood ear mushrooms (or use more dried shiitakes)", "4 cups boiling water", "2 to 2\u00bd ounces dried glass noodles (mung bean noodles)", "1/4 cup fermented soybean paste (taucheo) or Korean doenjang", "2 tablespoons oyster sauce (vegetarian, if preferred)", "2 red fermented bean curd cubes (furu; see Tip), or 2\u00bd tablespoons red miso paste", "2 teaspoons soy sauce", "1/2 cup peanut oil", "3 ounces/90 grams dried tofu skin, cut into 1-inch-thick strips (see Tip)", "4 large shallots, finely sliced", "8 garlic cloves, minced", "2 pounds green cabbage, cut into 2-inch-thick pieces, leaves separated", "2 large carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks", "1 tablespoon palm sugar or dark brown sugar, plus more to taste", "1 teaspoon fine salt, plus more to taste", "Cilantro sprigs, for garnish"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large heatproof bowl, cover the dried mushrooms with 4 cups boiling water.
