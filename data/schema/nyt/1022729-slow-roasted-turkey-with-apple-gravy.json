{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow-Roasted Turkey With Apple Gravy", "description": "Padma Lakshmi likes big, bold flavors \u2014 spices and citrus especially \u2014 and infuses her Thanksgiving turkey with them. She prepares the bird over a bed of herbs and produce, then uses those pan juices to create a fruity yet savory gravy. To keep the turkey moist, Ms. Lakshmi starts with a buttermilk brine, then roasts the bird at a low temperature to make sure it cooks through but doesn\u2019t dry out. But first, an initial blast in a very hot oven darkens the turkey in spots thanks to the sugar in the buttermilk brine. A final basting and uncovered cooking in the oven helps even out the mottled skin and ensures a delicate crispness. You can garnish the platter with the fruits, vegetables and herbs used in the recipe or serve the bird unadorned.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Genevieve Ko"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/23/dining/08PADMAREX/merlin_196956633_1083a8dd-ac4a-425d-9c3a-fe778f429a94-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P2DT6H", "recipeYield": "8 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, poultry, roasts, main course", "keywords": "apple, buttermilk, plan-ahead, whole turkey, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1313}, "recipeIngredient": ["8 fresh bay leaves", "2 1/2 quarts buttermilk", "1/2 cup granulated sugar", "1/2 cup coarse sea salt", "1 tablespoon black peppercorns, toasted and ground (see Tip)", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cayenne", "1 (14-pound) fresh or thawed frozen whole turkey, neck and giblets removed", "20 fresh bay leaves", "3 small Fuji or Honeycrisp apples, cored and cut into wedges", "2 small Granny Smith apples, cored and cut into wedges", "2 small fennel bulbs, sliced", "1 medium red onion, sliced", "1 medium yellow onion, sliced", "1 small bunch thyme", "10 slices fresh ginger", "12 garlic cloves, sliced", "1 orange, cut into 1-inch wedges", "Coarse sea salt", "1 1/2 tablespoons black peppercorns, toasted (see Tip), plus more toasted and ground for seasoning", "1 lemon, quartered", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "1/2 cup unsalted butter", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons brandy, preferably Pomona or Calvados (optional)", "Salt and pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Brine the turkey: Tear the bay leaves to release their natural oils.
