{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken With Vinegar", "description": "Jean-Georges Vongerichten learned how to make this recipe from the chef Paul Bocuse, who popularized it at La M\u00e8re Brazier in Lyon, France. Chicken with vinegar is one of the great poultry dishes from that area, where the chickens are considered by many to be the best in the world. Mr. Bocuse insisted that it was neither the amount of work nor the cost of ingredients that determined the worthiness of a dish, but how it tasted. The variations are numerous, but the piercing flavor of vinegar is so dominant that it matters little whether you use shallots or garlic, thyme or tarragon. One technical note: Most wine vinegar sold in the United States has an acidity level of 7 percent; many French vinegars are just 5 percent acidity. So it's best to cut strong vinegar with some water.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/27/dining/Chicken-With-Vinegar/Chicken-With-Vinegar-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT40M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner", "keywords": "chicken, red wine vinegar, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1133}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 579, "unsaturatedFatContent": "28 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "3 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "42 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "43 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "11 grams", "sodiumContent": "972 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 3-pound chicken, cut up for sauteing", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup minced shallots or scallions", "1 cup good red-wine vinegar", "1 tablespoon butter (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
