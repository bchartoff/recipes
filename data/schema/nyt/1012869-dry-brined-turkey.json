No more fussy liquid brine that alters the texture of the meat \u2014 just crisp, golden skin and tender, moist meat. This turkey will be the talk of the table. Allow two days for the bird to season before roasting.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kim Severson"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/14/dining/14TURKEY-CARVER/14TURKEY-CARVER-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H", "recipeYield": "12 to 14 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, roasts", "keywords": "fall, winter, gluten-free, main course, turkey", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 1899}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 564, "unsaturatedFatContent": "13 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "25 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "70 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "1233 milligrams", "sugarContent": "3 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 12- to 16-pound turkey, preferably a heritage or pasture raised bird", "Kosher salt", "1 tablespoon black pepper", "10 sprigs fresh thyme", "1/2 bunch flat-leaf parsley", "2 small onions, halved", "2 small apples, cored and halved", "1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened", "2 cups white wine (see tip)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Two days before serving, rinse turkey and pat dry.
