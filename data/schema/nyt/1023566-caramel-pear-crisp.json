{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Caramel Pear Crisp", "description": "The caramel in this comforting seasonal dessert is made with butter and sugar and is a bit easier to make than a water and sugar caramel. That said, it is important to use ripe fruit that will let off juice so that the caramel isn\u2019t too stiff. The cream cheese adds body and tang, and highlights the delicate flavor of the pears, but in a pinch, you could swap the cream cheese for \u00bc cup of heavy cream. Either way, a drizzle of cold heavy cream for serving would offset the sweetness nicely.\u00a0\u00a0", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/10/21/dining/sse-caramel-pear-crisp/merlin_214833930_19f25e77-a53c-42d7-a069-3bcb6157daf4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H10M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "almond, cobbler, crumble, and crisp, cream cheese, pear, rolled oat, fall, winter, thanksgiving", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 329}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons/58 grams unsalted butter", "3/4 cups/175 grams granulated sugar", "4 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces\u00a0", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "2 1/2\u00a0 to 2 3/4 pounds ripe pears (such as Bartlett or D\u2019Anjou), each cored and cut into eighths\u00a0\u00a0", "2 tablespoons chopped crystallized ginger (1 ounce), optional", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "2 teaspoons cornstarch", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 1/4 cups/100 grams old-fashioned rolled oats", "1 cup/136 grams all-purpose flour", "1 cup/95 grams sliced almonds", "3/4 cup/165 grams packed dark brown sugar", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 375 degrees.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the caramel: Add 2 tablespoons water and the butter to a 12-inch oven-safe skillet with high sides.
