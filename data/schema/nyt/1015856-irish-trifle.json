{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Irish Trifle", "description": "I call this Irish trifle because it was my Irish ex-in-laws who introduced me to this wonderful dish. It is one of the most irresistible desserts I make. I love to have leftovers because the cake just keeps soaking up that amazing custard sauce, which is spiked with sherry. I use up a few of the egg whites left over from making the cr\u00e8me anglaise in the cake, opting for a biscuit, in which the egg whites are beaten to a meringue, over a richer sponge cake. Although jam is traditional in this trifle, you could always top the cake with a berry compote instead.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/25/dining/25eggs4/25eggs4-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "brunch, lunch", "keywords": "cake, cr\u00e8me anglaise, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 44}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 tablespoon butter, softened, for greasing pan", "85 grams cake flour (scant 3/4 cup)", "14 grams cornstarch (1 1/2 tablespoons)", "120 grams eggs (2 extra-large eggs plus 1 tablespoon)", "150 grams sugar (2/3 cup), divided", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "85 grams egg whites (2 1/2 whites)", "Pinch of salt", "1 tablespoon butter, melted", "1/3 cup cream sherry, more to taste", "1/3 cup raspberry jam", "2 2/3 cups chilled cr\u00e8me anglaise (see <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1015855/cr-and-egrave-me-anglaise.html'>recipe</a>)", "1 cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream", "Freshly grated nutmeg"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Brush a 9-inch cake pan with softened butter and lightly flour sides.
