{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Salmon With Smoked Salmon Butter", "description": "Any salmon, especially the deep red wild sockeye, will benefit from a generous dollop of this smoked salmon butter. The smoky-velvet taste lends a robust character, so little other embellishment is needed. Make it in advance and keep in the freezer, and you have an uncommonly elegant dinner in no time. The butter will lift a fillet of arctic char, butterflied trout, seasonal shad or other white-fleshed fish.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Florence Fabricant"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/13/dining/13PAIRING/13PAIRING-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT20M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "", "keywords": "dill, salmon, smoked salmon, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 285}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 547, "unsaturatedFatContent": "21 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "1 gram", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "44 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "36 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "17 grams", "sodiumContent": "474 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "1 gram"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 ounce smoked salmon, preferably sockeye", "6 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature", "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "1 tablespoon minced fresh dill", "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil", "1 1/2 pounds salmon fillet with skin, in 4 equal pieces", "Salt and ground black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Use a knife to mince smoked salmon.
