{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ginger Beer-Glazed Butternut Squash With Gremolata\u00a0", "description": "While most winter squash recipes call for roasting the firm vegetable until nutty and caramelized, this recipe highlights the vegetable\u2019s creamy texture and sweet notes by simmering it in ginger beer until supple. Like many glazed recipes, this one showcases the beauty of great timing: When the squash is done cooking, the liquid will have reduced to a glossy sauce (provided you\u2019ve cut the squash into 1-inch pieces). Topping the mixture with a confetti-like gremolata of chopped ginger, garlic, parsley and orange zest turns this into a cold-weather side that sparkles.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/09VEG-THANKSGIVING-ginger-beer-glazed-butternut-squash/merlin_216141009_93ed9042-2586-45da-bed2-490166858023-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "butternut squash, ginger beer, parsley, christmas, thanksgiving, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 303}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 cups ginger beer", "3/4 cup vegetable stock, plus more if needed", "1 medium (3-pound) butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1-inch jewel-shaped chunks", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "1 tablespoon honey", "1/8 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves", "1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh ginger", "1/4 teaspoon finely chopped fresh garlic", "1/4 teaspoon finely grated fresh orange zest"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the ginger beer and stock to a large, deep skillet.
