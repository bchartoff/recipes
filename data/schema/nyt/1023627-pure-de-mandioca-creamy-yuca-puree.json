{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pur\u00ea de Mandioca (Creamy Yuca Pur\u00e9e)", "description": "For some Brazilians in the United States, yuca pur\u00e9e takes the place of mashed potatoes on the Thanksgiving table. In Brazil, where yuca is indigenous and abundant, the root vegetable is often peeled, boiled and mashed. Milk and butter make the pur\u00e9e rich and creamy. This recipe was provided by Thailine Kolb, who learned the dish from her mother, Liomar dos Santos Paula Araujo. In Brazil, her mother serves the dish at Christmas, but Mrs. Kolb, who lives in New Haven, Conn., has embraced it as a Thanksgiving tradition. You can use fresh or frozen yuca, with similar results. If using fresh, be careful when cutting the firm vegetable and removing the outer bark. When using fresh or frozen yuca, be sure to remove and discard the starchy core before eating.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Christina Morales, Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/09/dining/04yucarex/09yucarex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings (about 2 1/2 cups)", "recipeCuisine": "brazilian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, lunch, quick, weeknight, vegetables, side dish", "keywords": "christmas, thanksgiving, milk, yuca, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 17}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 pound frozen peeled yuca pieces or 1 1/2 pounds fresh whole, unpeeled yuca (see Tip)", "1 1/2 chicken bouillon cubes (16 grams)", "1 1/2 cups whole milk", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine", "Chopped parsley or chives, grated sharp Cheddar or black pepper, or a combination, for serving (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a pot of water to a boil in a medium saucepan.\u00a0"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using frozen yuca, proceed to Step 3.
