{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Lobster Salad With Green Beans, Tomatoes and Basil", "description": "This summery salad makes a fine celebratory lunch or cold supper and makes great use of seasonal vegetables. Everything is dressed with a bright basil vinaigrette. A dab of aioli on the side is a welcome option, too. The hardest part here is steaming the lobsters, but don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s easy \u2014 and economical \u2014 to do it yourself. Still, if the idea doesn\u2019t appeal, many fishmongers sell steamed lobsters for an additional fee. Or you can buy prepared lobster meat, though that\u2019s a bit more expensive. If you decide to do that, you\u2019ll need at least one-third pound per person.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/19/dining/14Tanisrex-salad/merlin_175528659_47cf9de4-8647-4887-a567-67b800e3454d-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "4 servings as a main course", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "seafood, main course", "keywords": "cherry tomatoes, green beans, heirloom tomatoes, lobster, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 138}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 (1 1/2- to 2-pound) live lobsters", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "3 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon black peppercorns and 1 teaspoon allspice berries (optional)", "1 or 2 small garlic cloves, roughly chopped", "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard", "3 tablespoons red wine vinegar", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "1 loosely packed cup parsley leaves", "1 cup green basil leaves, loosely packed, plus 1 small bunch green or purple basil, for garnish", "1/2 pound cherry tomatoes, halved", "1 pound small green beans (haricots verts), briefly cooked and cooled", "1 1/2 pounds heirloom tomatoes, cut into thick slices", "4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled, halved and lightly salted", "1 pound new potatoes, cooked and cooled", "Arugula or salad leaves, for garnish", "Aioli, optional (see Note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large pot or in batches, so as not to crowd them, steam or boil the lobsters in seawater or heavily salted water.
