{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Kongguksu (Cold Soy Milk Noodle Soup)", "description": "Traditionally enjoyed during the summertime in Korea, this refreshing cold noodle dish requires just five ingredients: cucumbers, dried soybeans, pasta, salt and water. The base of the dish is a nutty and rich homemade soy-milk broth, which is served ice-cold over thin wheat noodles. There\u2019s minimal hands-on work, but overnight soaking time is required, so plan ahead. Once the beans are fully soaked, the meal comes together in just 30 minutes. Adjust the thickness of the broth by adding more or less water, and for extra earthy flavor, try adding 1/4 cup of roasted pine nuts, peanuts or sesame seeds before blending. If you like, you can make the broth ahead of time and keep it in the refrigerator until ready to serve. You can also freeze it, but once thawed, whiz it in the blender to restore its smooth texture.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Kay Chun"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/02/dining/kc-kongguksu/merlin_176001786_ec55788a-47e0-42cd-89f3-ba55cab8964a-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT8H30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "korean", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, noodles, main course, side dish", "keywords": "cucumber, soup, soybeans", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 173}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 cup dried soy beans (about 6 ounces)", "8 ounces somyeon or somen (thin wheat noodles)", "3 1/2 cups chilled water", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste", "2 Persian cucumbers, cut into 2-inch matchsticks", "Toasted black or white sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a medium bowl, combine soy beans with enough water to cover by 3 inches and refrigerate for 8 hours or up to overnight.
