{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken With Artichokes and Lemon", "description": "If you like artichokes as much as I do, this recipe, often made at Passover by Jews from Morocco, is for you. You can use fresh or frozen artichokes, though trimming fresh artichokes is worth the effort for their delicate texture. To save waste, boil the trimmed artichoke leaves about 15 minutes until tender in water with a lemon, then enjoy them for lunch, dipping them into an easy sauce of yogurt spiked with a spoonful of Dijon mustard. Easily made in a frying pan, this tagine goes well with couscous, or a quinoa or bulgur pilaf, though that might depend on your Passover traditions, and Moroccan Jews do not allow rice or couscous. The dish can easily be made a day or two in advance and refrigerated or even frozen.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Joan Nathan"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/dining/31Nathanrex/31Nathanrex-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "jewish", "recipeCategory": "dinner, one pot, poultry, vegetables", "keywords": "artichoke, chicken thigh, lemon, onion, parsley, saffron, main course, spring, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 146}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 large lemons", "8 fresh globe artichokes (or 8 frozen artichoke bottoms, quartered, or about 1 1/2 cups frozen artichoke hearts)", "6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 pounds total)", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 medium yellow onion, diced", "4 garlic cloves, chopped", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, plus more to garnish", "1/2 teaspoon saffron", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 1/2 cups chicken broth, plus more if needed"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "If using fresh artichokes, fill a large bowl with water.

First, cut off at least 1 inch of the thorny top. Trim the stem near the heart, leaving about 2 inches of stem if possible, then peel off the outer green fiber of the stem. Using your fingers, tear off the tough outer leaves, then switch to a sharp paring or bird\u2019s beak knife, when necessary, to shave more inner artichoke leaves until you reach the tender pale green or yellow leaves and create a bulbous shape. Gently open the leaves and remove the choke using a grapefruit spoon or melon baller, then scrape and tear (or slice) the remaining leaves off so that only the bottom remains. Cut the artichoke heart in quarters; put the quarters in the lemon water as you work to prevent discoloration. Discard the rest of the artichoke, leaves and stem, or reserve for another use."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Pat chicken dry, then season all over with salt and pepper.
