{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Ricotta Polpette in Tomato Sauce", "description": "This recipe is quintessential cucina povera, which roughly translates as \u2018frugal cuisine of the poor\u2019 in Italian, and it originated in Calabria. Its simple deliciousness comes from a handful of ingredients. In mountainous Calabria, where cows cannot roam free, goat\u2019s-milk ricotta would typically be used, but recipes evolve over time and space, and cow\u2019s-milk ricotta is commonly used in North America. Most translate the Italian word \u2018polpetta\u2019 as meatball, but in Italy, it is any mixture of ingredients rolled into a ball and cooked. This meatless variation\u2019s base of ricotta is mixed with egg and bread crumbs, then rolled, poached in tomato sauce until fork-tender, and finally sprinkled with cheese. They make a perfect side to a first course of pasta or can be served on their own, with crusty bread, for sopping up the sauce.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Anna Francese Gass"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/09/29/dining/afg-ricotta-polpette/merlin_213671208_2553d655-4170-4155-acdf-5fca2ce34a06-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 servings (about 35 ricotta balls and about 7 cups of sauce)", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, dumplings, main course, side dish", "keywords": "basil, bread crumbs, crushed canned tomato, extra virgin olive oil, pecorino romano, ricotta, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 995}, "recipeIngredient": ["10 fresh basil leaves", "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly smashed", "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes (optional)", "2 (28-ounce) cans/about 8 cups crushed tomatoes", "2 tablespoons tomato paste", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "1 (32-ounce) container/about 4 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese (see Tip)", "2 \u00bd cups seasoned Italian bread crumbs", "3 large eggs", "1/4 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, plus more for serving", "1 tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Kosher)", "1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the sauce: Tear 5 basil leaves in half; reserve the rest.
