{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Pound Cake", "description": "Coconut oil and coconut milk add a tasty tropical essence to this moist pound cake. Be sure to buy unrefined virgin coconut oil, as it has the best coconut flavor and aroma. Coconut oil is much easier to measure and incorporate when it has been softened than at room temperature, when it is firmer. Try popping it into the microwave for very short bursts, about 5 seconds each, until it is roughly the same consistency as softened butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Samantha Seneviratne"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/05/dining/sse-coconut-pound-cake/merlin_184842264_cc54ac03-109e-4944-b9a7-5a293aa79d06-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dessert", "keywords": "butter, coconut milk, coconut oil, eggs, flour, pound cake, shredded coconut", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1024}, "recipeIngredient": ["6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (3/4 stick), at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan", "2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan", "2 teaspoons baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar", "6 tablespoons/85 grams softened coconut oil", "3 large eggs, at room temperature", "1 cup/240 milliliters canned coconut milk", "1 packed cup/85 grams plus 2 tablespoons sweetened shredded coconut, toasted (see Note)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 350 degrees.
