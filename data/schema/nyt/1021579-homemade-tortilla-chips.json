For one, they can support more toppings, since they\u2019re likely to be thicker. And you can control the level of salt and browning. This recipe allows you to bake or fry them: Frying results in the crispiest, snappiest crunch, while baking is incredibly easy. If you decide to fry, mind your stovetop heat, adjusting as needed so the chips turn golden in the same time it take them to crisp. The chips are delicious on their own, with salsa or guacamole, or in <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021572-the-original-nachos\">nachos</a>, chilaquiles or migas. Keep the chips in a sealed container or bag and they will stay beautifully crisp for at least one week.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Pati Jinich"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/04/dining/29nachosrex3/merlin_179172918_e8ca6499-2c0e-498f-968e-bddd52e25028-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "1 to 1 1/2 pounds", "recipeCuisine": "mexican", "recipeCategory": "snack, crackers and chips, finger foods", "keywords": "salt, tortilla, tortilla chips, vegetable oil", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 172}, "recipeIngredient": ["30 (5-inch) fresh corn tortillas (about 25 ounces)", "Vegetable oil (about 4 cups), as needed for frying or baking", "Nonstick cooking spray, for baking", "Kosher salt or sea salt"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Collect the tortillas into 2 tall stacks and cut into 6 even wedges.

Set aside. Fill a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet with about 1/2 inch vegetable oil (about 4 cups). Heat over medium until the oil reaches about 350 degrees and is hot but not smoking, 6 to 10 minutes. You can see if it\u2019s ready by dipping a tortilla wedge into the hot oil. It should bubble immediately and enthusiastically. Gently add enough tortilla wedges to fill the skillet in a single layer without crowding, and fry for about 1 minute per side, using a spider or a slotted spoon to flip them over, until lightly golden and crisp. (Do not allow them to brown too much or they will taste bitter.) Using the spider or slotted spoon, transfer the chips to the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle immediately with salt, so it adheres to the glistening chips. Repeat until all chips are cooked, transferring cooled chips to a large bowl and replacing the paper towels as needed. (Let the remaining oil cool to room temperature, then strain and transfer to a bottle to reuse it for future deep frying.)"}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To bake your tortilla chips, position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and heat to 375 degrees.
