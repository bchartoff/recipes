{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spring Roll, Master Recipe", "description": "Spring rolls go far beyond those deep-fried versions served as an appetizer at nearly every Thai restaurant in this country. They\u2019re found all across Asia, with wrappers, fillings and cooking techniques that differ from one country to the next. Fresh spring rolls, sometimes called summer rolls, are a staple in Vietnam. Most typically, they\u2019re made of rice paper filled with rice vermicelli, cooked meat or shrimp, raw vegetables, basil, cilantro and mint.\n\nThis master recipe allows you to mix and match your wrappers and fillings. Some tips: Don\u2019t overstuff. Rice paper is pliable, but it will tear if you stretch it too thin. And remember that before you even start to stuff, rice paper can be tricky. Soak a sheet of it briefly (10 seconds is about right) in a dish or skillet of hot water (110 degrees or so). Put it on a paper or dish towel so it doesn\u2019t stick, then fill and roll as tightly as you can, folding in the sides like a burrito. If you\u2019re using nori, spritz the sheets all over with a little water before you fill them; it will soften them up enough to roll without much hassle.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Mark Bittman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/08/dining/springrolls/springrolls-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "asian", "recipeCategory": "quick", "keywords": "appetizer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 35}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 77, "unsaturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "10 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "0 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "8 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "0 grams", "sodiumContent": "38 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 ounces rice vermicelli noodles", "1/4 cup mint leaves", "1/4 cup basil leaves (preferably Thai)", "1/4 cup cilantro leaves", "3/4 cup chopped, sliced, or shredded vegetables, greens, or fruit (like asparagus, beans sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, or kimchi)", "3/4 cup chopped or sliced protein (like raw salmon or tuna, tofu, or cooked meat or poultry)", "4 to 8 (8-inch) rice paper rounds, nori sheets, or large, pliable lettuce leaves (like red leaf, or Boston)", "1/2 cup dipping sauce of your choice (like ginger-scallion sauce, miso thinned with water, Sriracha mayonnaise, or plain soy sauce)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Soak the rice noodles in boiling water until tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
