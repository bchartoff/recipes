A simple dish with robust flavors, the recipe blends scrambled eggs with finely minced Virginia ham and anchovies. Before cooking, you rub the pan with a garlic clove, which scents the eggs without overwhelming them. If you're eating this for breakfast, as originally intended, serve it with toast points and butter. But if you're having it in the evening as a small first course \u2014 a perfectly acceptable choice \u2014 it should be accompanied with glasses of chilled fino sherry.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/21/dining/Eggs-Eli/Eggs-Eli-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT15M", "recipeYield": "Serves 4", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "breakfast, easy, lunch, quick", "keywords": "anchovy, eggs, ham, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 120}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 194, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "2 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "14 grams", "fiberContent": "0 grams", "proteinContent": "14 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "6 grams", "sodiumContent": "328 milligrams", "sugarContent": "0 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 garlic clove, peeled", "2 tablespoons butter", "8 eggs, cracked into a bowl", "1 tablespoon finely minced anchovy", "3 tablespoons finely minced Virginia ham, or other smoked ham"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Rub the inside of a large skillet with the garlic clove.
