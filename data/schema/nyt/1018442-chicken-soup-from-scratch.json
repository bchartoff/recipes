{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Chicken Soup From Scratch", "description": "Chicken soup is one of the most painless and pleasing recipes a home cook can master. This soup has all the classic flavors (celery, carrot, parsley) but has been updated for today's cooks, who can't easily buy the stewing hen and packet of soup vegetables that old-fashioned recipes used to call for. A whole bird provides the right combination of fat, salt and flavor. Don't be tempted to use all white meat, as the flavor won't be as round. Because making soup involves the bones and deep tissues of the bird, it is particularly reassuring here to use the highest-quality poultry you can find. This method produces a fragrant, golden, savory soup you want to eat all winter long; it's a perfect backdrop for noodles, rice or matzo balls.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Julia Moskin"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/29/dining/recipelab-chick-noodle-still/recipelab-chick-noodle-still-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews", "keywords": "appetizer, main course, carrot, celery, chicken, egg noodles, leek, onions, parsnip, fall, winter", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 2308}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 chicken, 3 to 3 1/2 pounds, with skin, cut up", "3 stalks celery, with leaves, cut into chunks", "2 large carrots, cut into chunks", "2 yellow onions, peeled and halved", "1 parsnip or parsley root (optional)", "About 1 dozen large sprigs parsley", "About 1 dozen black peppercorns", "2 bay leaves", "2 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste", "3 tablespoons reserved chicken fat, more if needed", "3 leeks, trimmed, halved lengthwise, rinsed and sliced crosswise into thin half-moons", "3 large carrots, peeled and cut into small dice", "Kosher salt and ground black or white pepper", "Egg noodles (fresh or dried), such as packaged wide noodles, spaetzle, fettuccine or pappardelle cut into short lengths (see note)", "Finely chopped herbs, such as parsley, scallions, dill or a combination"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Place the chicken, celery, carrots, onions, parsnip (if using), parsley, peppercorns, bay leaves and salt in a large soup pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to very low.
