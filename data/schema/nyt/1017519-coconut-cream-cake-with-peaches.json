{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Coconut Cream Cake With Peaches", "description": "In this trifle-like dessert, a tender coconut macaroon cake is layered with whipped cream and juicy ripe peaches. It\u2019s allowed to rest in the refrigerator so the cake can absorb the cream and peach juices, and the whole thing turns into an almost puddinglike confection. If you\u2019d rather serve it trifle-style from a large glass bowl, feel free. This is best after 24 to 48 hours in the fridge, when the cake has absorbed the maximum amount of cream. You can garnish the top with strawberries or more peach slices if you like, or leave it plain.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/08/dining/08APPE1/08APPE1-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "10 to 12 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "cakes", "keywords": "coconut, peach, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 134}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 397, "unsaturatedFatContent": "8 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "36 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "28 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "4 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "18 grams", "sodiumContent": "79 milligrams", "sugarContent": "32 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["Nonstick cooking spray, as needed", "4 large eggs", "1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated sugar", "1/8 teaspoon/1 gram fine sea salt", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "4 2/3 cups/280 grams dried unsweetened finely grated coconut", "2 1/4 cups/530 milliliters heavy cream", "2 to 3 tablespoons/15 to 25 grams confectioners' sugar, to taste", "1 teaspoon/5 milliliters vanilla extract", "3 large to 4 small ripe peaches or nectarines, diced", "Sliced peaches or strawberries, or both, for decoration (optional)"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees.
