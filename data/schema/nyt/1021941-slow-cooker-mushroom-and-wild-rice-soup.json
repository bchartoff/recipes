{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Slow Cooker Mushroom and Wild Rice Soup", "description": "Making creamy soups in the slow cooker can be tricky because it\u2019s not possible to simmer them with the top off and reduce the liquid. One easy way to thicken without reducing is to use a roux, a mix of flour and butter. Heat the roux in the microwave, then whisk it into the stock in the slow cooker before adding the other ingredients. (If you don\u2019t have a microwave, simply melt the butter in a small saucepan, stir in the flour, let it bubble, then proceed.) This soup is best prepared on the high setting for two reasons: First, when cooked on low, the wild rice becomes too soft before the mushrooms are tender. Second, the roux doesn\u2019t thicken as effectively on low. If you need a longer cook time, omit the rice, put the soup on low for 8 hours, and turn the heat up to high before serving. Cook the rice separately according to package directions, then stir it in before serving. <span>Find a pressure cooker version of this recipe</span> <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021942-pressure-cooker-mushroom-and-wild-rice-soup\">here</a>.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sarah DiGregorio"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/02/dining/sdg-creamy-mushroom-soup/merlin_182444493_7ccbe83a-aede-4bd3-8cdf-58c3ab71d1e6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, main course", "keywords": "dry white wine, mushroom, slow cooker, soup, sour cream, wild rice, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1847}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)", "1/4 cup all-purpose flour", "5 cups vegetable or chicken stock, plus more as needed", "1/4 cup dry white wine (see Tip)", "2 pounds mixed mushrooms (such as cremini and shiitake), tough stems removed, chopped into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces", "1 cup wild rice (about 6 ounces)", "2 celery stalks, finely chopped", "1 small yellow or red onion, grated or minced", "1 large carrot, peeled and finely chopped", "6 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped", "3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1/2 cup sour cream", "Chopped scallions or chives and fresh dill, for topping"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Put the butter in a microwave-safe container (a liquid measuring cup works well) and microwave until the butter is completely melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
