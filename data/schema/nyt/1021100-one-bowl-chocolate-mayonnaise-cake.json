{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "One-Bowl Chocolate-Mayonnaise Cake", "description": "Born out of a scarcity of fresh eggs, chocolate-mayonnaise cake is one of those Depression-era recipes that sounds a lot stranger than it tastes. After all, cakes rely on eggs and fat for tenderness and richness, and mayo is made of exactly those things, plus some salt and vinegar to give it tang. But you don\u2019t taste the tanginess of the mayo, and if you didn\u2019t tell anyone it was there, they would never know. Which is to say, don\u2019t let a lack of eggs or butter stop you from making cake. This cake is ridiculously good for the small amount of effort you put into it.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/21/dining/mc-mayo-cake/mc-mayo-cake-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "1 (8- or 9-inch) cake", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "easy, dessert", "keywords": "birthday, bittersweet chocolate, chocolate cake, cocoa powder, mayonnaise, one bowl", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1973}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 cup/25 grams unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch-processed or natural)", "1 to 2 ounces chopped bittersweet chocolate (optional)", "3/4 cup/180 milliliters boiling water, or use hot coffee, Earl Grey tea or mint tea", "2/3 cup/160 milliliters mayonnaise", "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda", "3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or a dash of bourbon or whiskey (optional)", "1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose or cake flour", "Flavorless oil or another grease, for the pan", "Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for finishing"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "To a large mixing bowl, add cocoa powder and chopped bittersweet chocolate (if using).
