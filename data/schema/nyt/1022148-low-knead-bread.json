{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Low-Knead Bread", "description": "This recipe produces a loaf of bread with significantly improved hole structure and flavor compared with this <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022147-no-knead-bread\">no-knead version</a> (inspired by <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread\">Jim Lahey\u2019s original no-knead bread recipe</a>), and requires not much extra work. Increasing the water content produces bread with a more custardy crumb and a more open, holey structure. Adding a few turns during the initial fermentation stage gives this wetter dough strength, letting it better retain its hole structure as it\u2019s shaped. The low, slow fermentation in the fridge allows for lots of flexibility, as the dough can rest there for up to three days before you decide to shape and bake it. Dough flavor and texture will improve with time, though after three days the flour may start oxidizing, producing unattractive gray spots.

Two hours before baking, wipe out any moisture collected on the inside of the medium bowl, dust a dish towel thoroughly on one side with rice flour or bread flour, then line the medium bowl with the towel, floured-side up.
