{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "White Bean Salad With Roasted Cauliflower", "description": "This is the kind of substantial salad that\u2019s nice to have on hand, no matter the occasion. If you have time, it\u2019s best made with large dried white beans, such as cannellini, simmered at home. (It\u2019s great to have a pot of cooked beans in the fridge all summer long, for deploying in salads and soups.) But using canned beans is absolutely OK. The recipe calls for roasting the cauliflower, but it could also be cooked on a grill to impart some pleasant smokiness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "David Tanis"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/06/01/dining/01tanisrex5-whitebean/merlin_207073905_ae1d8204-4a5d-4ab7-8ca8-d5113207aef7-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT1H", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, salads and dressings, vegetables, appetizer, side dish", "keywords": "cannellini beans, cauliflower, celery heart, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 891}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 small head cauliflower, cut into \u00bd-inch slices", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "Salt and black pepper", "4 cups cooked white beans or 2 (15-ounce) cans, drained", "1 cup thinly sliced celery heart (the tender inner stalks and leaves)", "3 tablespoons chopped parsley", "3 tablespoons slivered scallions", "1 large shallot, diced small", "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard", "1 tablespoon lemon juice", "1 teaspoon lemon zest", "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, plus more to taste", "1/2 teaspoon ground fennel (optional)", "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste", "Salt and black pepper"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees.
