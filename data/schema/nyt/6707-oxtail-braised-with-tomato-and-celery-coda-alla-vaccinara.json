{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Oxtail Braised With Tomato and Celery (Coda Alla Vaccinara)", "description": "Ms. Hesser brought us this recipe for the classic Roman stew back in 2002 after she visited Rome with her family. \n\nOxtails are a fatty and tough cut of meat, but here, a lengthy braise yields a rich, unctuous sauce seasoned with cinnamon, clove and marjoram. It's delicious by itself or served over a hearty pasta, like rigatoni. And don't be deterred by the large amount of celery the recipe calls for. It reduces to a flavorful pulpy slurry that will surprise you.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Amanda Hesser"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/29/dining/coda-alla-vaccinara/coda-alla-vaccinara-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT3H30M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "times classics", "keywords": "", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 319}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 795, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "12 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "56 grams", "fiberContent": "4 grams", "proteinContent": "46 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "20 grams", "sodiumContent": "1197 milligrams", "sugarContent": "6 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 pound pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch dice", "1 carrot, peeled, finely diced", "1 small onion, peeled, finely diced", "4 inner stalks celery, 1 finely diced, 3 sliced into 3-inch-long pieces", "Extra-virgin olive oil", "3 pounds oxtail (trimmed weight), severed at each joint into pieces about 3 inches long", "Sea salt or kosher salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste", "2 cups white wine", "3 sprigs fresh marjoram or 1 1/2 teaspoon dried leaves", "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 (28-ounce) can peeled Italian tomatoes, drained"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
