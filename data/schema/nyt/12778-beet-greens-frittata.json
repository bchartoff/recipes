{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Beet Greens Frittata", "description": "The New York City Greenmarket Web site has a handy table that shows what\u2019s available during each month of the year. It tells me, for example, that fresh beets are available from June through November, but that you can count on the greens only through September. Use whatever color beet you choose for this recipes. The red ones will be higher in anthocyanins, the pigment-based phytonutrients that are believed to have strong antioxidant properties. But yellow and pink beets have a lot going for them nutritionally as well. All beets are rich in folates, potassium and the B-complex vitamins niacin, pantothenic acid and pyridoxine. This is one of the most versatile dishes you can make with beet greens. Cut the frittata into wedges and serve as a main dish or into smaller diamonds and serve as an hors d\u2019oeuvre. It packs well in a lunchbox, too.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Martha Rose Shulman"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/24/health/nutrition/24recipehealth-frittata/24recipehealth-frittata-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "italian", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday", "keywords": "beet greens, eggs, gluten-free, halal, healthy, kosher, low sugar, nut-free, vegetarian, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 88}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 144, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "5 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "10 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "9 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "335 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil", "1 pound beet greens, stemmed and washed thoroughly", "2 garlic cloves, minced", "8 eggs", "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons milk"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat a large pot of water over high heat while you stem and wash the beet greens in 2 changes of water.

Heat over medium-high heat and add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Hold your hand over the pan, and when you can feel the heat of the olive oil, test the heat by dropping a bit of egg into the pan. If it sizzles and cooks at once, the pan is ready. Pour in the egg mixture. Swirl the pan to distribute the eggs and filling evenly over the surface. Shake the pan gently, tilting it slightly with one hand while lifting up the edges of the omelet with a spatula to let the eggs run underneath during the first few minutes of cooking. Turn the heat down to low, cover (use a pizza pan if you don\u2019t have a lid that will fit your skillet), and cook 10 minutes, shaking the pan gently every once in a while. From time to time, remove the lid and loosen the bottom of the omelet with a spatula, tilting the pan so that the bottom doesn\u2019t burn. It will, however, turn a deep golden brown. This is fine. The eggs should be just about set; cook a few minutes longer if they\u2019re not. Meanwhile, heat the broiler. Finish the omelet under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, watching very carefully to make sure the top doesn\u2019t burn (it should brown slightly, and it will puff under the broiler). Remove from the heat, shake the pan to make sure the omelet isn\u2019t sticking (it will slide around a bit in the nonstick pan) and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes and up to 15. Loosen the edges with a wooden or plastic spatula. Carefully slide from the pan onto a large round platter. Serve hot or at room temperature."}]}
