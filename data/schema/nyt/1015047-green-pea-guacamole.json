{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Green Pea Guacamole", "description": "Adding fresh English peas to what is an otherwise fairly traditional guacamole is one of those radical moves that is also completely obvious after you taste it. The peas add intense sweetness and a chunky texture to the dip, making it more substantial on the chip. They also intensify the color of the green avocado \u2014 and help the guacamole stay that way. Pea guacamole keeps its bright hue in the fridge for a few days without turning brown around the edges. A good dose of lime juice helps this cause. This dish, a collaboration between ABC Cocina\u2019s chef-owner, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and his chef de cuisine, Ian Coogan, is the best kind of greenmarket tweak upon a classic.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/dining/mc-green-pea-guacamole-horizontal/merlin_143416878_62a82be1-3e63-4da2-ba43-06ec39b38ce6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT45M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dips and spreads", "keywords": "appetizer, avocado, peas, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 471}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 112, "unsaturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "9 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "9 grams", "fiberContent": "5 grams", "proteinContent": "2 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "1 gram", "sodiumContent": "211 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/2 pound fresh sweet peas, shucked (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup peas)", "2 small jalape\u00f1os", "2 tablespoons packed cilantro leaves, chopped, more for garnish", "3/4 teaspoon salt, more as needed", "3 small ripe avocados, mashed", "2 scallions, whites only, sliced as thin as possible (about 1/4 cup)", "Zest of 1 lime", "Juice of 1 lime, more as needed", "1 tablespoon toasted sunflower seeds", "Flaky sea salt, for serving", "Tortilla chips, for serving", "Lime wedges, for serving"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil and prepare a bowl with water and ice.
