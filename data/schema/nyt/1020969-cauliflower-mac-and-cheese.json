Cauliflower florets cut into noodle-size pieces step in for macaroni in this pasta-less macaroni and cheese; they\u2019re roasted and draped in a mixture of melty Cheddar, heavy cream, garlic and cayenne. You could also add mustard, thyme or rosemary, or even caramelized onions, and swap out the Cheddar for Gruy\u00e8re or another cheese. As the cauliflower cooks in the cream mixture, the cream thickens slightly and the cauliflower continues to brown. Serve it with a bright, crisp salad to offset the richness.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Ali Slagle"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/26/dining/as-cauliflower-mac-and-cheese/as-cauliflower-mac-and-cheese-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "totalTime": "PT35M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, weekday, casseroles, vegetables", "keywords": "cauliflower, cheddar, garlic, heavy cream, main course, side dish", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 31}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 large cauliflower (2 1/2 pounds), cut into small florets the size of macaroni", "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and black pepper", "1 1/2 cups grated Cheddar (about 6 ounces)", "1 cup heavy cream", "1 garlic clove, finely grated", "1/4 teaspoon cayenne"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
