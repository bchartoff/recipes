{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Spiedies", "description": "Spiedies are a mainstay sandwich of Binghamton, N.Y., and its surrounding boroughs. They\u2019re made of meat marinated for a long time in what amounts to Italian dressing, then threaded onto skewers, grilled, and slid into a cheap sub roll, sometimes with a drizzle of fresh marinade or hot sauce. The recipe that follows calls for beef, but pork or venison can be used almost interchangeably. Marinate for a long time: a full 24 to 36 hours is not uncommon, and results in chunks of meat that are so deeply flavored that they taste great even when slightly overcooked.  (If you use chicken, however, reduce the length of time in the marinade, since the meat starts to break down after 12 hours or so.) Serve the spiedies with an additional drizzle of lemon juice and olive oil, on top of Italian bread or alongside rice.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Sam Sifton"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/dining/20ENTREE6/20ENTREE6-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "P1DT25M", "recipeYield": "4 to 6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, barbecues, sandwiches", "keywords": "beef, chicken, lamb, pork, venison, main course, summer", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 527}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 590, "unsaturatedFatContent": "35 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "6 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "45 grams", "fiberContent": "1 gram", "proteinContent": "42 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "9 grams", "sodiumContent": "669 milligrams", "sugarContent": "1 gram", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["2 to 3 pounds beef, pork, venison, lamb or chicken, cut into small cubes, at most 1-inch square", "Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste", "1 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "\u00be cup red wine vinegar", "Zest of 1 lemon", "\u00bc cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 2 lemons)", "4 cloves garlic, peeled, smashed and roughly chopped", "1 bay leaf", "1 tablespoon thyme leaves", "1 tablespoon oregano leaves", "1 tablespoon basil leaves, rolled and chopped into chiffonade", "1 teaspoon granulated sugar", "1 teaspoon kosher salt", "1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper", "1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Make the marinade: Whisk together all the ingredients in a large bowl."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Add the meat to the marinade and cover tightly, or place into large, re-sealable plastic bags and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours (or 10 to 12 hours for chicken)."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Build a fire in your grill, leaving about 1/3 of grill free of coals, or set a gas grill to high."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Remove the meat from its marinade and thread onto metal skewers, or wooden ones that you have soaked in water for 30 minutes or so.
