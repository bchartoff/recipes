{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Two-Tone Ginger Custard Pie", "description": "This silky, spiced custard is especially dreamy inside a crisp, flaky crust. Some custard pies use eggs as a binder \u2014 this one uses flour for a thick custard that always sets perfectly, creating a flat surface that\u2019s ideal for a dusting of sugar. This striking design requires just a sheet of paper and a sifter, while the topping itself is ground freeze-dried mangoes and strawberries mixed with confectioners\u2019 sugar. You can find the freeze-dried fruit at most grocery stores and health-food stores, where they are often grouped with the nuts and dried fruit. The pie can be made up to 1 day ahead, but for the cleanest look, it\u2019s best to apply the sugar within 2 hours of serving; beyond that, the sugar will eventually absorb moisture from the pie and begin to change color. But even if you skip the topping, the filling is beyond delicious all on its own.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Erin Jeanne McDowell"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/14/dining/14Two-tone-ginger-custard-pie/14Two-tone-ginger-custard-pie-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "totalTime": "PT2H", "recipeYield": "8 to 10 servings", "recipeCuisine": "american", "recipeCategory": "pies and tarts", "keywords": "cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg, dessert", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 159}, "recipeIngredient": ["<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019713-perfect-pie-crust\">Perfect Pie Crust,</a> prepared for a custard pie and chilled", "2/3 cup/135 grams granulated sugar", "1 cup/130 grams all-purpose flour", "2/3 cup/145 grams light brown sugar", "1 tablespoon ground ginger", "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg", "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon ground clove", "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt", "1 3/4 cups/420 milliliters whole milk", "1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream", "\u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract", "Egg wash (1 large egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water)", "1 ounce/28 grams freeze-dried mango", "1 ounce/28 grams freeze-dried strawberries", "\u00bc cup/30 grams confectioners\u2019 sugar"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "On a lightly floured surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out a disk of dough into a circle about \u00bc-inch thick.
