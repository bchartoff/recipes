{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Roasted Mushrooms With Smoky Pomegranate Sauce", "description": "For the very best roasted mushrooms, this recipe employs a steam-roast method, which allows the mushrooms to caramelize and crisp while retaining a surprising amount of moisture. They\u2019re tossed on a sheet pan with olive oil, poultry seasoning and granulated onion for flavor, then covered tightly with foil and set in the oven to steam in their own juices until tender. Finally, they\u2019re broiled just until their edges crisp, and their natural essence becomes more concentrated with deep nutty notes. An easy pan sauce made with pomegranate juice, peppercorns and ancho chile provides a burst of tanginess and brilliant color \u2014 and it is easily made vegan with the use of vegan butter.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Alexa Weibel"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/16/dining/09VEG-THANKSGIVING-roasted-mushrooms-with-smoky-pomegranate/merlin_216141147_90702cee-ff80-454c-b785-cc35178e8a64-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 to 8 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, vegetables, main course, side dish", "keywords": "ancho chile, black peppercorn, oyster mushroom, pomegranate juice, rosemary, shallot, christmas, thanksgiving, vegan", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 222}, "recipeIngredient": ["1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning", "1/4 teaspoon granulated onion", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing", "3 pounds oyster mushrooms, torn into small clusters, or other mushrooms (see Tip)", "6 small fresh rosemary sprigs\u00a0", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter or vegan alternative\u00a0", "1 large shallot, minced", "1 dried ancho chile, torn into big pieces, seeds and stem discarded", "2 large garlic cloves, minced", "4 teaspoons whole black peppercorns, coarsely crushed using the flat side of a knife", "Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)", "1 teaspoon vegetable stock concentrate (such as Better Than Bouillon), optional", "2 cups pomegranate juice"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Heat the oven to 425 degrees and set a rack closest to the broiler."}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Prepare the mushrooms: In a small bowl, stir together the poultry seasoning, granulated onion, salt and pepper.
