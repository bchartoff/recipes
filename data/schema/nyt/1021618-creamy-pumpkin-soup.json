{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Creamy Pumpkin Soup", "description": "This recipe turns canned pumpkin pur\u00e9e into a sublimely creamy, aromatic soup that makes for an elegant first course or a satisfying lunch on a cold day. While the combination of pumpkin and fall spices can easily veer in the direction of dessert, the addition of fresh rosemary, garlic, caramelized onions and curry powder plants this soup firmly in the savory camp. Finally, to make this recipe vegan, substitute olive oil for the butter, full-fat coconut milk for the heavy cream, and vegetable broth for the chicken broth. If time and availability allow, consider roasting your own sugar pumpkin for this recipe: The soup will have a deeper, more complex flavor (see Tip).", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Lidey Heuck"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/18/dining/18lh-creamy-pumpkin-soup/lh-creamy-pumpkin-soup-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT50M", "recipeYield": "6 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, soups and stews, vegetables, main course", "keywords": "apple cider, cream, maple syrup, pumpkin pur\u00e9e, sage, fall, winter, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 4, "ratingCount": 1182}, "recipeIngredient": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "2 medium yellow onions, halved and thinly sliced", "2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary (or 2 teaspoons dried rosemary)", "2 tablespoons maple syrup", "4 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped", "1/2 cup fresh apple cider (or 3/4 cup apple juice)", "4 cups low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed", "2 (15-ounce) cans pumpkin pur\u00e9e (not pumpkin pie filling), or 3 cups homemade pumpkin pur\u00e9e (see Tip)", "1 teaspoon mild curry powder", "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, plus more for serving", "Pinch of ground cloves", "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed", "1/3 cup heavy cream, plus more for serving", "2 tablespoons unsalted butter", "12 fresh sage leaves"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "In a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium heat.
