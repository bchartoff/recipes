Cut them in half, top with a filling, then fold them in half and again in half, so they\u2019re like little coronets. These thin pancakes are easy to make in today\u2019s heavy nonstick crepe pans. Give the batter plenty of time to rest so that the flour swells and softens; that will make the crepes delicate.
