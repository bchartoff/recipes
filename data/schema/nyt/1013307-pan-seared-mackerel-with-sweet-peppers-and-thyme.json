{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "Recipe", "name": "Pan-Seared Mackerel With Sweet Peppers and Thyme", "description": "Mackerel escab\u00e8che is one of those dishes I have always preferred to admire from afar. It\u2019s traditionally prepared by pickling the fillets in vinegar, but I\u2019ve never quite cottoned to its biting flavor. To me, it overwhelms the delicacy of a good fresh piece of fish.\n\nAt home, I sprinkled the fish fillets with salt, pepper and some sweet paprika. Then I let them sit while I slowly stewed the leeks, carrots and peppers with some garlic and thyme.\n\nI seared the fish until lightly browned but still very moist inside. When people say they don\u2019t like mackerel because it\u2019s too strong and dry, it\u2019s usually because the fish has been overcooked. But when cooked right, until just flaky in the center, the flesh is mild and almost buttery.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Melissa Clark"}, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/02/dining/mackerel-peppers-thyme/mackerel-peppers-thyme-articleLarge.jpg", "totalTime": "PT30M", "recipeYield": "4 servings", "recipeCuisine": "", "recipeCategory": "dinner, easy, quick, weekday, one pot", "keywords": "fish, mackerel, main course", "aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating", "ratingValue": 5, "ratingCount": 67}, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 561, "unsaturatedFatContent": "30 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "40 grams", "fiberContent": "3 grams", "proteinContent": "28 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "7 grams", "sodiumContent": "397 milligrams", "sugarContent": "4 grams", "transFatContent": null}, "recipeIngredient": ["1 1/4 pounds mackerel fillets", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, more for seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, more for seasoning", "1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika", "6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, more as needed", "2 leeks, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced", "2 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced into rounds", "1 small red bell pepper, thinly sliced", "1 small orange or yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced", "5 large thyme sprigs", "3 garlic cloves, minced", "1/2 cup dry ros\u00e9 or white wine", "1/2 teaspoon sherry vinegar, more to taste"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Season mackerel with salt, black pepper and paprika.
